"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was great. Staff went above and beyond bringing hot tea to room at 11:30 pm at no charge!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","A wonderful hotel - would definitely stay there whenever we are in Alexandria again.  Wonderful staff.  We remarked that the first room was very far from the elevator, and they immediately moved us to a much nicer/larger room across from the elevator without question.  I hope I am able to stay at a Kimpton Hotel on future trips."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Tolles Zimmer, nettes Personal"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Outstanding. Will definitely return.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","O hotel �� bel��ssimo, assim como os quartos, os quais s��o enormes e bastante confort��veis.A localiza����o �� excelente; o hotel fica na rua principal de Alexandria.H�� transfer gratuito aeroporto-hotel e vice versa.S�� ha internet free no lobby do hotel e o acesso ao computador e impressora �� pago, o que acho um inconveniente.Tivemos alguns probleminhas com o servi��o do hotel, os quais demonstraram a falta de preparo dos funcion��rios.Nos disseram que uma encomenda da Amazon n��o tinha chegado, quando na verdade j�� tinha sido entregue ha mais de 5 dias.Uma meia sumiu do banheiro e n��o nos deram qualquer satisfa����o, nem se mostraram preocupados com o ocorrido. Fomos embora sem que nada fosse resolvido.Tivemos indisposi����o ap��s um jantar no restaurante do hotel.Por essas raz��es, a estadia acabou n��o sendo satisfat��ria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I needed a place to stay in VA that was close to or in Alexandria and the Monaco was available for a great value. I enjoyed my stay, room was comfortable and clean. Was disappointed on parking cost but I was able to work around that. Very convenient to old town."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel itself was very nice. The desk staff were very attentive and helpful. The rooms were nice but not dusted/cleaned adequately each day. The problems we had were few but definitely impacted whether we would stay there again. The hallways and elevators were not air-conditioned and were in the high 80's in July. Also, with no complimentary breakfast offered, the free coffee was in high demand. The coffee hours ended at 9:00 a.m. and the coffee was always empty, missing ""to go"" cups, or out of cream and sugar. A daily conversation with the desk staff on this issue grew tiresome with our 7 day stay. Look elsewhere if service is important to you."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We arrive around 1 am,  for a 5 night stay, and the lady could not find our reservation. After a while she she found it but could not tell us a thing about our Expedia gold benefits. She told us it was not her problem a we should ask the manager eventually."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent location, good value, clean and comfortable room. What more could you ask for?!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Overall the stay was fine. Room was clean, bed & pillow were comfortable, nice toiletries and towels. Check in was a little slow, but staff in the lobby were nice. However, the AC unit is loud & in the room. The mini fridge is somewhat noisy. And the toilet kept running every 10 minutes (loudest filling toilet ever). And the headboard had seen some damage (fake leather). The location is great though. Short walk to harbor area, lots of restaurants, etc."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room was very nice and clean. The hotel was uniquely decorated and stylish. The location was nice if you plan to go out in old town, but a good 20+ minute walk to public transportation and a hike to get into DC."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel exceeded our expectations. Our room and the hotel was well kept, clean and the decor tasteful.The 5 p.m. manager hosted wine tasting is an excellent way to return to the hotel after a nice day out to see the sites and touring. It was also a great ice breaker to meet other guests (or not).To top it off this particular property is perfectly located on King Street in historic Alexandria surrounded by shops and excellent choices of restaurants.We will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","from check in to check out the staff goes out of its way to insure that your stay is problem free. Beautiful rooms, excellent staff, great location. We go to Alexandria 2-3 times a year to enjoy the history and would not think of staying elsewhere. It is located right in the heart of Old Alexandria and within walking distance of everything."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lovely. Stayed there for the Inauguration and the staff was on top of their game. Very attentive despite a packed house and also lots of sweet touches like shuttles to the metro on inauguration day etc.Went on to stay at the Monaco in Chicago and was so disappointed by the service after a wonderful stay at the Monaco in Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria on King Street. Shops, bakeries and wonderful restaurants lined the street. The 1 mile walk to the Metro gave us plenty of opportunities to window shop. The staff was great. Our room was a little on the small side, but for 2 nights we were more than satisfied. Highly recommended."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My daughter and I had our first get-away alone since she started her family. We live in Baltimore so the journey was short.  I love this hotel and its lovely staff, great wine reception, dog-friendliness.  We enjoyed the large pool and sat in front of the reception fire place to warm up and meet interesting guests."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","great hotel, great location, excellent room...thermometor in room did not register correct temperature, too hot to sleep, the hallway was colder than our room.We had it set on the lowest setting it would go.Also, the key card would not work the first time, and as petty as it sounds, I had to walk all the way back downstairs, wait in line and then hope the key would work when I went back upstairs.In this day and age, all hotels should have free internet, at least in the lobby.Looked clean, but I dropped an ear ring back close to the edge of the bed, when I picked it up, there were ""things"" clinging to it, needed better vacuuming?"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We chose this hotel because Kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. Upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. When the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. Check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted Dori by name and offered her a pet package. The room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. Overall still very good. All the amenities of a Kimpton including 4pm Kids Hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us Pet Friendly. The hotel was very busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. I would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of Old Town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like Restaurant Eve."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very friendly staff; good location. Child and pet friendly. Great swimming pool. Nice, interesting decor; clean. Overall, a very good hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room was clean and very nice. The bed and pillows were perfect. The only issue was checkout...they overcharged me for parking. It wasn't listed on final receipt and I would've never known if I didn't check my credit card statement (this wasn't the credit card holding charge). Quickly resolved, but still a hassle and the reason for less than 5 stars"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent location and friendly staff. We loved the free wine and snacks from 5-6 nightly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My only real complaint is why pay for parking & 2 use the internet ON YOUR OWN CELL? Shouldn't that be on the hotel? Just a thought
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great value for the money. Convenient location in Old Town close to many fun things.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great value for the money. Convenient location in Old Town close to many fun things.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We arrived late and the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer or more efficient.  We were settled in our room in less than 10 minutes.  When I couldn't connect to wifi, a call to the front desk resulted in a knock on our door within two minutes.  I had some special needs, and the staff did an excellent job of meeting them.  The hotel is perfect for a stay in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",overall...great hotel!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Had an amazing stay. Clean hotel, very friendly staff!!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was expecting a typical Kimpton stay - wine and hors d'oeurves at 5 pm in the ""living room"", but found out when we got there they didn't do that because of some ABC laws in Alexandria - though the Embassy Suites does offer it. Room service breakfast was quite expensive... On the flip side - the location cannot be beat - right on the free trolley route and close to all Old Town Alexandria awesomeness!!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A wonderful 2 night stay in Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Room was decorated beautifully. Bathroom was luxurious with all the amenties. Bed was wonderful and comfortable. Hotel was right in the heart of Old Town with no reason to move/use the car. Staff was always great. I particularly liked that the staff at the door ALWAYS welcomed me back or wished me a nice day. And that staff in other locations always made eye contact/smiled/had a positive comment.Only tiny negative was finding a previous patron's leftovers in the mini fridge.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the ""notes"" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice hotel in a beautiful area of Washington. Room needs a bit of a refurbishment (e.g. heating unit made an terribly loud noise as it shut on and off during the night) and the gym needs upgrading.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved early evening wine in the lobby and it was great fun that the hotel is dog friendly even though we didn't have a dog with us.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was in a great location. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. The customer service was outstanding!!! It was nice to be greeted by name without them having to look at my credit card first!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a great night at the Monaco.  I have stayed at both this one and the one in downtown DC.  Love them both.  Great people, management, and hotel.  We will be back."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had a wonderful stay. Rooms are large and very clean. All of the staff were super friendly and extremely helpful in all regards.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel is well located in a very attractice and historical site. Rooms are kind of small but comfortable. Service is excellent and staff very friendly.The restaurant has an excellent menu and seems to be popular among locals.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The stay was good, price of the room was too expensive for the hotel. I have stayed in others in the area for less than half the price, that had more services and free parking. Don't think I will recommend or stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel used to be a Holiday Inn -- the hotel is limited by that configuration.  Monaco has tried to make it a boutique hotel and have done a pretty good job, but it is not a four star hotel.  I would give it three stars.  Other than that, they try hard, did a good job, and we were quite satisfied with staff, location, and cleanliness."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff were attentive, but the cleaning staff were a touch impolite at times.The restaurant served decent breakfast. Parking was quite expensive, at $27 a day."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","King St is amazing. My wife called it a clean Bourbon Street. I agree. It is not as raucous (good thing) and there are tons of restaurants and shops within walking distance. Also, the whole Old Towne Alexandria is very inviting."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We only stayed one night but it was wonderful. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean beautiful comfortable we felt as though we were at home. Location is very nice nice to walk around with the shops close to the water. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful Hotel - cozy room, nicely appointed and clean. Love the wine happy hour! Great location and friendly staff. Will definitely stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great neighborhood, but older hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","When we go back to DC we usually stay at the Monaco because of its location.  If my husband has to take the car for a meeting, I can walk to the shops and restaurants and I feel completely comfortable there.  When we are together, it's convenient to everything we need to get to, our old neighborhood, good restaurants and the major highways.This past weekend, there were a lot of little kids and dogs, I guess because it was a holiday weekend.  We heard dogs barking and kids crying, didn't bother us too much since it was during the day, if it disturbed our sleep this review might have had a different ending."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",One word: excellent
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is located in Old Town, Alexandria, VA. It is a renovated older hotel but the rooms were quite nice with marble sink and tile in the bath and nicely done d��cor. The hotel offers free shuttle service from Reagan International, but it only runs every hour. However, if you call the hotel they will let you know where and when to meet the shuttle. They offer complementary coffee and tea each morning and a wine bar each evening although we did not use the latter. There are many restaurants near the hotel including a very nice French caf�� next door. If you are a Kimpton rewards member, you can even receive a coupon good for $10 worth of items from the mini-bar in your room. The only negative was that the hotel is about a mile from the King St. Metro stop which provides the quickest and least expensive access to Washington, D.C.All things considered we would definitely consider staying there again during future visits."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. The location was convenient to basically everything (food, shopping, entertainment, transportation) in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","the hotel was a great location, walking distance to so much.  Staff was very helpful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Have stayed at this hotel many times and the staff is personable & committed to excellence. Kimpton's ability to identify quality individuals from diverse backgrounds and then have a top notch traing program is reflected in each stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel has a nice charm; not your cookie cutter luxury hotel. The staff was nice, the location in old town is perfect."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","All shopping and restaurants are short walks from the hotel.  The best location of any hotel in Alexandria.  The staff was most accommodating.  One day, my wife and I decided to go for a walk along King Street.  A member of the hotel staff ran to us with an umbrella in hand.  He suggested we talk it in the event of rain.  We look forward to a return visit to the Hotel Monaco in the near future."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had a fantastic time and highly recommend this hotel for families. The pool was fab and so was the happy hour for kids and adults.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Did recon for our wedding next year. Will definitely have our guests stay here.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is located ideally right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, VA.  It made it the perfect place to stay and see the sights.  We loved the quaint surroundings and the hotel staff and check-in process couldn't be more pleasant and efficient.  We would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Alexandria or the Wash. DC area."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","A complimentary bottle of water and maybe a small coffee maker in the room would be nice.Overall, I was very pleased."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","After reading about the Hotel Monaco online, I changed my reservation at the Marriott, and I was very glad that I did. You would expect to pay a lot more for this hotel that what our room rate was. The Kimpton hotels are so cool - loved the room decorations, efficient bathroom, comfy beds and lively lobby. Being a pet friendly hotel, it didn't smell. The outside furniture in the courtyard area was so relaxing at night. The menu for dinner was a bit different than what we expected and I would not eat there again. I loved this hotel and would stay there again when I go to Old Town to visit my son and his fiance."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We couldn't have been happier with our stay. The staff was uniformly friendly and kind, the room was great (a bit more creatively decorated than your typical hotel), and you just can't beat the location. We were just a few blocks from just about everything we wanted to do. (Oh... and they have an indoor pool that we got a *lot* of use out of.)I wasn't expecting anything other than another cookie-cutter hotel, and I was really surprised at how wrong I was."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was a fun, chic hotel in the perfect location for a night out on the Old Town."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco is very well situated, near the King Street shops and the waterfront. That is its best asset. Also, particularly good is the service. The staff are welcoming and always helpful. Otherwise, the hotel is standard for a premium hotel. The closets are a little cramped, but the windows open and the room temperature is well controlled. I have a personal dislike of duvets, but the hotel furnished the proper blanket."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel in great location but expensive rooms and parking. Could have stayed a few blocks west on King street for $100 less a night had I known that bus service on King street is free and frequent. The two beds in our room where very narrow for two and who wants to sleep in separate beds?
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","if you drive a car, then you shuld feel comportable and meet nice front desk. Most of all, my family colud have good sleep on the very nice bed and bedclothes. Near from the hotel, very good restaurants are there. Don't worry about your breakfast and dinner with walking."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great place to stay, super price for the service. Attitude of hotel staff made the stay the best We've had in a long time. Looking foward to next visit to DC"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great place to stay, super price for the service. Attitude of hotel staff made the stay the best We've had in a long time. Looking foward to next visit to DC"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff is top notch. There is a big difference in the size of the rooms (same price) The rooms that face King Street are much larger then the interior rooms. It's a shame that there isn't any outdoor patio furniture
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Alexandria on yksi niistä harvinaisista USAn kaupungeista, joissa väki kulkee kadulla. Kaupunki on eräänlainen vanhan ajan elävä museo, pikku putiikkeja ja ravintoloita pääkadulla. Samalla kadulla on tämä Hotelli Monaco, joka on hyvin persoonallinen ja viehättävä. Saimme ullakkokerroksen tilavan huoneen ja viihdyimme hyvin."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Overall we were pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. When we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. Very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a perfect base camp for touring DC. The metro station was within walking distance and a trolley was also available for getting to and from the metro. On the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. The area was totally safe for walking. The hotel is very close to the waterfront and the Torpedo Factory Art Center and the street entertainment in that area. Located on King Street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of DC. I hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. Wish we had had more time. Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel had great service. The bathroom was newly remodeled, so was absolutely beautiful. The best part was the location - conveniently located to great restaurants, bakeries, metro, and the river."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I stayed here a month ago, liked it so much that we returned here on our most recent trip. I didn't mention the daily wine reception with interesting wines in my last review. It is a nice event at 5pm daily in the lobby. Creatively decorated rooms with a good bed for a restful nights sleep, great location for old town Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent service throughout the hotel including the front desk, room service, Jackson 20, bell service. The sleeping rooms are enchanting and relatively large. Close to great shopping and restaurants and nightlife."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room was very elegant and cozy. We enjoyed our room decor quite a lot ! Parking was an unexpected difficulty, and frankly started our visit off in an unhappy way. We couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. There is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. Once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. You end up in some garage down the street. Also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken English, ""the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you""-- yeah, maybe if WE COULD GET OUR CAR ANYWHERE NEAR THEM!However, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. The rest of the staff was very courteous. I didn't appreciate the attitude if the woman at the front desk, but I still enjoyed my stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My husband and I stayed here at a friends recommendation and loved every minute of it. The hotel is excellent and in a great location. Plenty of places to eat and shop close by. The only negative I have to say is the free trolley is not a reliable form of transportation. We walked to the King Street Metro station (14 blocks away) more than we road the trolley, but the walk was beautiful and peaceful. Everyone around was super friendly. We are already talking about going back soon!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room was so nice and comfortable.  Just a fabulous hotel.  Food was fantastic in the restaurant.  Close to everything I wanted and a great price too.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","You can't beat the location. Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. But, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. Bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. It was just for one night, and there was nothing negative. The location, staff, room - everything was just fine. My friends and I enjoyed happy hour in the lobby and an excellent dinner in the hotel's restaurant."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel was just charming. The decor was modern and eclectic and somewhat whimsical. Everything was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the linens luxurious. I would recommend this to anyone.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a very nice, comfortable hotel. The service is excellent and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice location in old town Alexandria about a mile from the King St. Metro station (shuttles to and from the hotel available by simply calling the concierge).We highly recommend this to anyone."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great stay. Perfect location in the heart of Old Town. We upgraded to the small suite with balcony. Totally worth it!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We really liked this hotel. It was relaxing and we enjoyed our stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Wonderful as always!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We couldn't have chosen a better hotel.  It's within walking distance of everything, the staff was very attentive and the rooms had a very nice charm to them. The only (small) issue we had is that AC unit was a bit loud - but since we are getting to the warmer days, it is expected that the unit needs to work hard to keep the room at a certain temperature. We thought it was really convenient that they provided little items that are easily forgotten: toothbrush/paste, phone charger, etc - upon request."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wasn't informed of $27 parking fee at time of booking, found out about that at check in. Room seemed closed in and dark, needs updating. Shower curtain was dirty, looked like someone blew their nose on it. Stained throw pillow and towel. Mattress was horribly uncomfortable, both myself and my wife spent a restless night. Forget the gym, the weight set is too complicated for a good workout and of the 5 pieces of cardio equipment, 1 functioned properly. The overall area had little to offer, unless you are into art. Homeless people were sleeping in doorways 30 feet from the doors of the hotel in the morning. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Wish we hadn't wasted our time and money on this hotel. When we informed the staff of the condition of our room, we were met with an oh. Thanks for nothing."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is perfectly situated in Old Town Alexandria, VA   It is in the heart of town next to many restaurants and historic places.  With a rollaway bed and two double beds, my sons and a friend were easily accommodated in one room.  Always a pleasure to be at this site.  Some very small updates in the room do need to be done."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everyone was very helpful. I had an excellent experience and stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nicely renovated
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","As a business traveler, I absolutely love staying at this hotel. Not only are the rooms comfortable and tastefully decorated, but the service is fantastic. The lobby is the ""place to be,"" with plenty of action, wine hour, and coffee/tea in the mornings. The location is perfect for me as well, with an unending supply of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I also like the small touches in the room, like a hair dryer, extra space, and robes."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We drove into town for the Cherry Blossoms Festival in D.C., but didn't want to stay in $300+ hotels in the city...that's where Monaco provided the much needed relaxing atmosphere for this one-night stay and all the amenities and comfort that one might need. Awesome shower and comfy bed (two of my critical features), as well as location in the middle of Alexandria's shopping & restaurant district made this stay very memorable. Helpful staff at the front desk was a pleasant bonus, as well."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Parking is cheaper across the street.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","O hotel é belíssimo, assim como os quartos, os quais são enormes e bastante confortáveis.A localização é excelente; o hotel fica na rua principal de Alexandria.Há transfer gratuito aeroporto-hotel e vice versa.Só ha internet free no lobby do hotel e o acesso ao computador e impressora é pago, o que acho um inconveniente.Tivemos alguns probleminhas com o serviço do hotel, os quais demonstraram a falta de preparo dos funcionários.Nos disseram que uma encomenda da Amazon não tinha chegado, quando na verdade já tinha sido entregue ha mais de 5 dias.Uma meia sumiu do banheiro e não nos deram qualquer satisfação, nem se mostraram preocupados com o ocorrido. Fomos embora sem que nada fosse resolvido.Tivemos indisposição após um jantar no restaurante do hotel.Por essas razões, a estadia acabou não sendo satisfatória."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very relaxing  and close to restaurants and the waterfront.  Easy access to the water taxi to DC
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were pleasantly surprised by the decor and size of our room. We stayed in a double bed guestroom and had plenty of space. The bathroom was spacious and very clean. The pool area had plenty of windows that opened up and the fresh air was nice. I would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staying in Old Town Alexandria was great--the area has so much to offer in terms of restaurants, unique shopping, and historic character. I was there for a whole week, so had lots of opportunity to interact with staff when coming and going--especially since I had a car in valet parking. They were extremely friendly and personable, addressing me by name after the first day there. The atmosphere of the hotel was very inviting. The restaurant was also good--although the quantities were huge, so I found myself leaving food on the plate. The room would be better if it had an arm chair or someplace else to sit--there was an odd large ottoman, but it was not a good place to watch TV from or read. Other than that, everything was very nice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From the time we walked into the hotel until we left with our bags after check out, the staff at this location was nothing less than fantastic! They made us feel important and addressed any concern we had with immediate attention. I was filling out a survey about the hotel, and left a less than satisfied mark on the questionnaire. Within 5 minutes, I received a call from the front desk and an email. My problem? We were 20 mins away from where our plans were. Even though it had nothing to do with them, this hotel was all about making our visit enjoyable. Kudos to the front desk, cleaning staff, and everyone else that works at this place!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lovely boutique hotel that is located in heart of old Alexandria.  Good for children and adults with quick foods close by and coffee in lobby.  Wonderfully located and personnel were delightful and helpful.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I stayed here for a weekend get away. The hotel is awesome! Great staff, really cool vibe and great location. The hotel is pet friendly so we saw some pretty cool dogs and surprisingly we didn't hear any barking at night ( I was a little concerned about that). There's so much to see and do within walking distance. We valeted our car for $25 and walked everywhere. So overall it's a great place to stay. A few little critiques: 1. Some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. The fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. Kinda odd. It's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks! BUT there's no room to put anything of your own in there ( I know, I know, it's wet bar, but one shelf would be great). We didn't buy anything, but everything is reasonably priced. - So the bottom line is, we will be back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a prime example of how great the unpublished rates can be! Plush, spacious room with luxury amenities such as marble bathrooms, a big deep bathtub, overstuffed chaise lounge chairs, dreamlike bedding, beautiful decor. Rooms like these truly make leaving home and sleeping elsewhere a treat that one can look forward to."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Located on King St., shopping and all amenities available. Comfortable and beautiful accommodations with a very friendly staff.  Whenever I need to be in DC, I choose to stay in this hotel and I look forward to returning.  King Street has restaurants and shops, CVS and Dunkin Donuts...the trolley is available to go to the waterfront and it is just beautiful. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a very sweet and professional check-in staff member and given a token for a beverage because I had just missed cocktail hour.  How nice.  Thank you again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff was tremendous at the Monaco Hotel in Alexandria. From the front desk to the doormen to the hotel shuttle driver - they could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We enjoyed Alexandria as well - a truly delightful town with great shops and eateries.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We visited Alexandria, VA over the 4th of July weekend. We had a great time, the town was very nice. The shops and restaurants we visited were very good. We enjoyed the marina and enjoyed the fireworks from there. We also enjoyed visiting the George Washington Masonic Temple - great for all you Dan Brown enthusiasts! We stayed at the Klimpton Hotel (the location was perfect); however, the room we stayed in was extremely hot - the ac was barely working. On the bright side - the room was beautifully decorated."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved the hotel, and the neighborhood shopping and restaurants couldn't be beat! Can't wait to stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","if you drive a car, then you shuld feel comportable and meet nice front desk. Most of all, my family colud have good sleep on the very nice bed and bedclothes. Near from the hotel, very good restaurants are there. Don't worry about your breakfast and dinner with walking."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I stayed a week with our Granddaughter, to show her the nations capital. We were very happy with this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to be friendly to Haley, especially the Doorman. She is 10 years old and loved it. The hotel was in beautiful condition. One exception, a small piece of marble was missing in one corner of the bathroom floor. Hardly noticeable but, I noticed. The pool was great and had a lifeguard, awfully nice when traveling with a child. I missed having a spa but the work-out room was nice. Doggy Happy Hour in the courtyard (yes lots of real dogs) was a hoot. I would definitely use this hotel again. Both comfortable and convenient."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was my first visit to this hotel on a recommendation - loved it. Beautiful room: comfy bed, great amenities, very helpful and nice staff. Not too far from the metro (a little bit of a walk, but not too bad). Wonderful little shops surrounding it. Only thing missing was a continental breakfast in the morning, but there are plenty of little cafes surrounding to make up for that!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",the staff was great. it was refreshing to stay in a swanky/modern style hotel as opposed to the more traditional looks of the others. we will definately go back!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was excellent. Staff courteous and helpful. Afternoon wine was a party.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We came in for our honeymoon, and they upgraded us to a larger terrace room. It was beautiful and the service was amazing. Beautifully designed rooms and great amenities."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","What can I say.... this hotel is beautiful, well appointed, in an excellent location, well maintained and is funky in it's design but charming and cosy all at the same time.All members of staff were friendly, attentive, helpful and pleasant to talk to. Our room was impeccable, spotlessly clean and comfortable.The hotel is located on the main street in amongst the shops, bars, restaurants and only a 5/10 minute walk to the harbour. You would think that it would be noisy but I honestly didn't hear any noise from the main street.The indoor pool is small but it was clean and well maintained with a life guard on duty at all times.I really wished we had stayed here for longer, so if you're going to Alexandria this hotel is a must!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Bel h��tel bien d��cor�� aux chambres spacieuses. Bon accueil comme dans tous les h��tels du groupe Kimpton.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I always stay at this hotel when I don't have to be in the center of DC. It is very accessible to DC via metro. 3 miles from Reagan National airport, and easy trip to most anywhere else via metro or car. The Monaco is in the center of restaurants and shops on King Street. The hotel is great- super nice staff, fun decor, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, only tiny negative is that their workout room is really small and limited, however, they DO have an indoor pool and there is a great running path along the river at the end of King Street. No in room coffee but complimentary coffee served in the lobby in the morning and wine in the afternoon."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","First and foremost, it's a beautiful hotel in a great area. Very comfortable room. But way to over priced for the stay. My only complaint is it so noisy!! Constantly people walking and talking loudly in the rooms and hallways. Up until 4:45am in the morning!! I could even hear the couple in the neighboring room have ""relations""! Very short and loud!! If quietness was a guarantee, I would consider staying again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice very clean super trendy hotel! Only Complaint is that our bed was hard. Very hard. We both woke up with a back ache.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","A 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. That is not this hotel. I booked because of experience with Kimpton hotels in other cities. This one does not meet the Kimpton standard. Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. It is not at the moment a 4 star."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent Kimpton hotel located in a lovely town. Rooms furnished to a very high standard including luxurious bathroom. Would certainly look to stay here again if visiting Washington
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is ideal. Close to the Strand.  There's a bus stop on the block for a free shuttle that goes up and down King St., but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.Only negative was that you could hear every sound in the hallway outside.  If I wasn't traveling by myself, maybe I wouldn't have noticed the noise so much.  I was by the elevators and could hear it ding as it went up and down; didn't matter if the elevator stopped on the floor or not."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very helpful staff. extremely convenient location. Nice restaurant and bar.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Located steps from the best of Old Town and incredibly comfortable stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel is in a good location if traveling to DC. There is a free trolley service that runs in the early afternoon to the metro station. The rooms are comfortable, but they need to turn their mattresses over because if your in a King size bed you may find yourself sleeping in a ""ditch"". Our son slept in the lounge chair because of its novelty but the hotel provided us with a roll-away bed when we asked. The hotel pool on the third floor was fine but the only hiccup was that it is closed from 11-2pm.  The area has a large selection of restaurants surrounding the hotel so no problem getting a bite to eat. Complementary morning coffee was a plus. A Good Choice for all type of travel, even if you bring your dog. Really enjoyed our trip."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It started poorly. The shuttle went right by us at the airport. The hotel was quick to suggest we take a taxi , which they reimbursed us for.  We were early but they graciously showed us to our room.the room was rather small and a little scruffy. They give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were very thick and hard. the staff was good and the location is great"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We would only add this:I was afraid the fish was not feed in my room - it caused stress for me - my fault I asked for the fish..But Bertha needed attention and I would suggest a TAG to when the ""requested"" fish is fed/tended to so guest actually enjoy the fish and dont worry about its care - just a thought : )Parking - we ASSumed parking would be included on our 3 night stay. That might have been better explained/represented. We could have had dinner at that cost alone.Everything was GREAT - STAFF Superior - but do address above for complete comfort/satisfaction of future guest.THANKSSYN & CIN"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The minute we walked in we loved this hotel. Parking, staff, interiors, convenience all top notch. We had no idea what we were getting into being from Las Vegas and booking sight unseen. Our daughter's joined us from VA and NC and loved everything! It was so easy to hop on the water taxi, trolley and Metro to DC without the high price. We could not have asked for a better stay. Also, dog friendly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very happy with our stay. The room was a little smaller than what I expected but it could have just been the room we were in. Other than that, great location on King St. Near alot of shops and restaurants. Definately would go there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lovely hotel that has a staff that always goes beyond the ordinary to make your stay special. Don't miss the free wine reception at five!  A great place to meet your fellow travelers.  Take on the pool of you have time.  Lots to see and do on King Street!  The hotel has its own fleet of bikes.  Take a ride down to Mt Vernon!  Or take a boat ride to National Harbor.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","this is obviously the hipster hotel option in Old Town and while the hotel looks lovely and is decorated nicely I was very underwhelmed.I arrived on a totally freezing windy night, I saw two door guys standing inside the door watching me take my bags out and they just stood there.The don't mention self park and automatically valet'd my car. When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway. I used to think I was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel but I guess not as I'd be considerate not to make my evening plans loudly outside someone's room at 11PM."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is located in a great location, lots of restaurants, bars, and cool shops. The hotel lobby was very cozy and the complementary glass of wine every evening was a nice touch. The room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable. I can usually sleep on just about anything, but actually woke up every morning with a sore back. Also, one day I returned to find the housekeeping staff had cleaned the room but left the door open. Very disappointing. The restaurant was average, it seems like the focus is on the famous chef's name and maybe not the food. Overall though, the staff was very helpful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Accommodations were excellent. Every staff member was courteous and appeared sincerely interested in offering good service, including the concierge and doormen."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We found a public parking garage within 2 blocks of the hotel that charged $4 per day.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Close to National Airport. Wonderful hotel with free shuttle, helpful front desk and all staff service! Put creativity and festive spirit to my business trip to DC.  I could take care of computer, efficient commute between airport and DC, and enjoy the hotel!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Every once in a while, a visit to a hotel is just positive from start to finish.  This was one of those such stays.  Available parking was reasonable, with in/out privs and no penalty.  The staff was very friendly, and helpful.  Their food recommendations were outstanding.  The location was perfect, near plenty of food and shopping and easy to get to.  The room was very quiet, and spotless.  Kimpton always does a great job.  I would have a hard time finding something to complain about."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Kind of eccentric hotel, but very comfortable, reasonably priced for the area and a short walk to all the sites ni Old Town. Pet friendly, but has ""no pet"" floors for people (like us) who aren't in love with everyone else's dog. Great service. Definitely not the ""big box"" hotels that are all the same. Will definitely give it another visit next time I am in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel wifi not strong. Could not get service. Also many tv channels scrambled parking too expensive for that area
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Comfortable and convenient hotel with adjoining restaurant. Located in shopping and restaurant area and within walking distance to the Potomac. Very convenient shuttle to Reagan Airport takes only 15 minutes!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",wrong rooms the room i booked was not the room i was placed in they then put me in another room which still was the one i paid for i was refunded the difference in the morning but of the few times ive stayed there that was the first bad experience
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Tr��s belle d��coration originale (comme r��guli��rement dans les hotels Kimpton), service impeccable, excellent confort. Par ailleurs, id��alement situ�� pour commencer une visite �� pied des b��timents d'Alexandria ou juste pour aller au restau, sur bord de Potomac ou dans la rue principale. La note moyenne mise par les voyageurs n'est pas usurp��e !"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Forgot wakeup calls and newspaper every morning.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Lovely property, attentive staff! so glad I stayed at this property. This town is so charming and relaxing. only a few minutes away to the DC Convention center. would love to return and would definitely recomend."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We like this hotel for its spacious room and perfect location opposite of the city hall. And our room is at the side room, very quiet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",They did have any queen or king bed rooms available only double rooms even though I had a reservation for a king bed room.  All they did to compensate for it was offer us a free continental breakfast which is just coffee and pastries.  I asked for a refund for our room since I had already paid for it and the guy behind the desk said he couldn't help me with that since I booked it on Expedia.  We ended up walking down the street in 10 degree weather to another hotel owned by the same franchise.  When I told them what happened they at least apologized and the lady behind the desk even offered to email Expedia for me to get my refund which is what the first guy should have done.  I'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but I would not recommend this hotel for that reason.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was one of the most charming hotels that I ever visited. The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. I will definitely stay there when I am in the Alexandria, VA area!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My husband and I had a lovely second anniversary stay at the Hotel Monaco. From the friendly doormen who greeted us to the detailed decorating in our clean and welcoming room, I felt like someone else had thought through the details for my stay so I could just relax and enjoy our vacation.If you visit, make sure to check out the accompanying restaurant, Jackson 20. We had the Eggs Chesapeake and the Tall Stack (pancakes, REAL maple syrup, bacon, and hash browns)... Both of which were incredibly delightful and satisfying. The best breakfast we've had while traveling for quite a while!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was very nice and the experience was enjoyable. We got a king bed when we only expected a queen. There are many dogs at the hotel which was fine for us because we like dogs. The concierge we spoke to sent us to a restaurant that was closed for business which seemed a little unprofessional. Other than that we had a great experience! Love the town
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From the moment I walked in I was greeted by name, offered complimentary beverages, assisted to my room, and had all my travel/entertainment questions answered before I was completely checked in. Although the design of the hotel not as retro and fun as their Helix Hotel counterpart in Washington DC, what they lacked in style they definetely made up for in service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco was a great option for my business travel.  The location was convenient, with nice amenities, and exception service by the hotel staff.  An all around great Kimpton experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Another getaway to old town and love this hotel stayed another night with help from Calvin at the front desk!! He was so helpful
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a 3.5 star hotel that is in a great location. The beds at this hotel are very comfortable, rooms have good amount of space. The decor is tired and the furniture has seen better days. Stains on the furniture chairs, wallpaper pealing off in the rooms and in the hallways. The bathroom double doors leaves little privacy. The most disappointing was the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. While taking a shower (that has great water pressure), you pull back the shower curtain and the liner is loaded with hair that is not yours. I stayed at this hotel for 5 night. I asked the front desk on my first night if they could empty out the mini refrigerator of it's over priced items. This never happened. I just left everything on top of the TV stand. House keeping never got the message or the hint that I left. Why is it that a hotel 6 don't charge for internet or parking but when you pay over $180.00 a night for a hotel you will pay for all separately."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything is lovely except no one came to clean the room or change the towels, this is with two teenagers.  We had asked the cleaning staff that were nearby early in the morning, but nothing happened. So about 5:00 pm we asked the front desk who did take care of it"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice hotel with great service and helpful staff. Check-out time is convenient, location is very good, valet parking was extremely convenient. If I had to nitpick and complain about something, it would be difficult to find anything that is a valid complaint."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco is a beautiful place to stay. The lobby is wonderful. The elevators well decorated. Marble throughout the hotel. Very impressive. However, after returning from a wonderful day on the town, having dinner and a few drinks, this is where our stay turned sour. Unbeknown to us, the room air conditioner wasn't working well at keeping the room cool! After looking at the room temperature control, the climate settings only allow a range from 65 degrees and a high of 73 Sweating all night! Horrible night sleep! Ceiling fan would have helped. For the price, I thought someone would have checked to see if we were comfortable. We decided to relocate elsewhere. Very disappointed."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Stayed for the first time in this area of the country. My husband and I traveled with two small children, and found that the hotel was very accomadating. I was so impressed by the small details that every staff member took to make sure that our stay was excellent. There was someone there with a smile to help load and unload luggage, park the car, and they even took the time to have the crib in our hotel room before we checked in. Not once did I have anyone that was less than professional approach me. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling and demands a four star hotel for your family."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",great place to stay. enjoyed the location. the hotel was clean and uprayed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",AC in rooms blasting so loud that my bed that was next to the unit was literally shacking. The manager tried to switch me to different rooms but they are all the same. I have lost 3 nights of sound sleep. I will never stay in this hotel again
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great service, beautiful hotel, friendly & knowledgable staff, as well as an excellent location! I will be visiting this hotel again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great spacious rooms, very clean hotel, great location and nice staff.  The onsite restaurant was great for breakfast."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Went to a show At the Birchmere. Second time we've stayed at Hotel Monaco. Great place!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I wish I could give this place a better review, since I love Kimpton hotels, but unfortunately the Monaco did not live up to our expectations. - Snarly woman behind the counter gave us attitude when we tried to check in 45 min early. We were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - Took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful location - however - many hotel guests with service animals - some of which were just simply large dogs.  Housekeeping must do a good job as room was fine - clean, etc. - but it seems like in Alexandria VA, it would be good to be a dog."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco is ideally situated only a few minutes walk to the water and among many shops and restaurants. The staff is ever present and helpful. The only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. We later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. And the bar closes early. There were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 I believe. There is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. One of the pourers actually remembered what I and my wife drank the night before. Finally, I had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. We missed two because we were slow in getting there. Doesn't bother me, but I wonder if some seniors might find it difficult. Overall, nice rooms, fantastic location and nice, friendly staff."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Only issue was barking dog in room across the hall
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff was so friendly and I loved the decor and the location. This is a fun and very comfortable place to stay!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Awesome! Staff is eager to make you comfortable and happy. I won't stay anyplace else when we visit Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was attending a conference in downtown DC, and this hotel was in Alexandria, a bit far. Cabs were readily available, but the cab ride from downtown ate up the difference in rates I would have paid closer to my conference. So a great hotel, with nice details and good service, but for a downtown DC itinerary, a bit remote."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. The restaurant was great and staff was friendly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom had plenty of storage area for our things so it didn't get cluttered. The bathrobes were very plush and I loved having the tea and coffee in the lobby to go!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Good location if you're staying in Old Town. It was a $15 cab ride to the Gaylord Convention Center and there are plenty of hotels that are an easy walk to the convention center, so I would stay at one of those next time. It was also a $100 cab fare from BWI so be sure to fly into Reagan OR take the blue Super Shuttle for $45.The rooms are a bit smallish and if you are sensitive to noisy AC units (why do people always complain about noisy AC?), then this hotel may not be for you."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everyone was so helpful and friendly. Jackson 20 is a great bar/restuarant. Wish I brought my dog.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful hotel in the heart of historical Alexandria 4 blocks from Potomac and walking distance to numerous sights and delicious restaurants. Staff pleasant and helpful. Loved the extras like coffee in am and wine in pm served in vibrant lobby.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A friend and I stayed there just by chance as we were headed through. We were so impressed with the staff and how nice they were and the city Of Alexandria was absolutely beautiful. This hotel is great and its location is perfect if you are looking for something to do without having to drive.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, great facility, great service"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Prefect location just blocks from the waterfront, shops, restaurants, and pier. The hotel is beautiful and definitely one of my favorites in the Kimpton chain. The rooms and lobby have a Persian flair. I loved everything about this hotel. The staff was very attentive as well."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location. Neat lobby, resturant and vibe. Decent room at a decent price, especially for the neighborhood."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",great service & very affordable price right downtown in Alexandria
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very comfy with a boutique feel. Location was wonderful.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hôtel super . Très bonne adresse à conseiller.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hôtel super . Très bonne adresse à conseiller.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The monaco was clean and cute. Easy to get a cab and accommodating staff. Room service kept messing up our orders and the night menu is very expensive and limited but overall it was decent. Robes are fun but feel like carpet.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My girlfriend and I stayed at the hotel on our way back from Myrtle Beach back to NY. The hotel was very up to date and plush. The service was amazing also. It is right in the heart of downtown so there is no need for your car once you get there. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel staff is very polite.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great property and dog friendly. Staff is excellent and very helpful. Atmosphere and rooms are top notch high end quality at an affordable price.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Warm and helpful staff; clean, comfortable rooms. Afternoon wine reception is very open and well attended - a great time to meet up with friends or make new ones. We borrowed the hotel bicycles to travel to a conference across the Potomac - lots of well maintained bike trails in the area. Walking distance to anything you'd want to see or do in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Our stay was very nice. We just didn't like having to pay for parking at the hotel, so we parked at our Son's restaurant. I also didn't like having to pay for wifi!!! It seemed like there were a lot of "" fees & charges""."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",New TV did not work properly after technician lookEd at it numerous times.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Posh Hotel right in the heart of the action in Alexandria, VA! We loved our stay at the Monaco on King Street, just steps from everything. While we were in town for business, this place made us feel as comfortable as a resort property. Evening wine receptions, morning coffee in the cozy but posh lobby appointed like a large living room. Business folks, families and dogs all mingling like invited guests at a party. It was wonderful!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel is gorgeous! Rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Location was excellent. This is the only place I will stay when in Alexandria!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is simply wonderful. The neighborhood, King Street in Old Town Alexandria, VA, is fantastic and very convenient to DC. One can walk to shops and dining. Plenty of outstanding choices for both. The rooms are great: forward-thinking decor, lots of small details, very clean, very comfortable. Complaints: standard definition TV; no fridge or microwave. Otherwise, an outstanding experience.And the people are really nice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a delightful hotel stay - we got a real bargain - booked on the morning of our stay at a greatly reduced rate - what a deal!  Everything about this hotel was terrific particularly the location - lots of restaurants along with great walkable streets with historic homes and business.  We totally enjoyed this experience.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My experience at the Hotel Monaco was just what I expected--clean, professional, courteous. The staff was friendly, the free airport shuttle a plus, and the nightly wine reception delightful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We founf the Hotel Monaco to be a fantastic hotel. The room was very nice and updated, the staff was great."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Old Town Alexandria is beautiful with several restaurants within walking distance. Although I don't know much about this town, it seems as Hotel Monaco is located right in the middle of every everything. I'm returning to DC in August, and will definitely stay at this hotel (bringing my wife this time)!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My experience wasn't great. There was a ton of noise, not only in the room above mine, but in the hall as well. The walls must be paper thin. And the doors of the room have a tendency to be very heavy and slam behind you if you aren't aware... RECOMMENDATION TO HOTEL: Install device to the doors to soften the blow of doors slamming in the hall. I'm trying to sleep!!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful outside, great service from the manager and staff, but the air conditioning didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in. We first arrived to find out that the safe in our room didn't work. Then we were switched to another room, whose TV remote didn't work, air conditioning didn't work, and telephone by the bed didn't work. We were switched to another room whose AC didn't work. Mind you, we have a siberian husky, so the AC problem was not what we needed. We were upgraded to a two floor suite with two separate thermostats, the bottom stayed cool, but the upstairs was still unbearable. Overall, the manager tried to appease us with the room upgrade, and even paid for our dinner one night and parking for three nights. But sleeping in 74 degree plus temps is not my idea of a comfortable vacation, regardless of the accomodations or benefits."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a unique hotel with steady guest traffic. Dogs are allowed and they are everywhere, so if you are a dog lover, this is the place to be. My room overlooked King street but was still quiet and very comfortable. A fun place to stay!The hotel is a convenient walk to the Potomac and harbours as well as many great restaurants."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything was fantastic: location, door staff, etc. The only down note was at check-out there were some extra charges. We brought it to staff attention. She took some charges off, then we showed again where it was wrong. We were not upset at the charges as mistakes are made everywhere, but her attitude about it was very non-caring. I repeat, this waqs the ONLY down note and I STILL recommend the hotel. I believe the staff anme was Jackie."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My stay was wonderful! I would recommend this hotel highly. From the valet parking attendant to the rest of the staff, everyone was wonderful. The rooms were immaculate and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The metro statio is about 10 blocks from the hotel but t he free trolley makes it a breeze to get thrs. I wish my stay was longer and I will definitely stay at the Monaco again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Got there a little late as the wine tasting was over. We had been trying to wait as a violent storm pushed ahead of us. We were successful, but it put us checking into the hotel after 10:00 at night. By the time we got everything unpacked and settled into the beautiful and well-appointed room, only a few items were still being delivered 24/7 by rooms service. The food and its service was my only disappointment.The brocolli cheese soap was cold when we got it, but the hummus was well-warmed to a degree that would have better suited the soup.My mother didn't received any napkins or utensils, so I shared my knife with her for the hummus/pitas.I ended up pulling out some travel napkins from my bag. I wish there had been a coffee maker in the room, but we ordered a carafe of it for breakfast.So those were the annoyances, but the room was so gorgeous felt roomy and was so well-appointed and comfortable. The linens and pillows were top of the line and it felt as though we were in capable and caring hands.I look forward staying here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is very convenient in its location to all the stuff in old town. The staff was courteous and professional. The decor is something of an aquired taste. The room was large and clean and a good price. However my ""courtyard view"" was little more than a view of the hotel's trash dumpster.  The situation with room service is sub par. It's a long story. Over all the hotel is a good place to stay given how centrally located it is in old town. Just don't expect too much from the room service."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful place to stay for both Alexandria and DC visit. Staff was very courteous, freindly, and responsive to requests. Rooms and public areas were very nice. Little details -- like chilled drinks in the lobby and option to have a gold fish in your room -- make this hotel feel like a home away from home."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Lovely hotel. Comfortable and spacious room, amazingly quiet with excellent blackout draperies which enabled us to sleep soundly. The staff was very pleasant and efficient. When we had problems with the TV remote, an engineer was sent promptly to our room to take care of it. Wish we could have stayed another night or two! Convenient inside parking was a plus."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This boutique hotel was fantastic! The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful. We loved how pet friendly this hotel is, and how clean it is. We were in the heart of King Street and were very close to everything. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be staying here again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I only spent on night here on business but would return for business or pleasure trips.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful hotel, with great customer service. I have stayed at Autograph Hotels before and this definitely lives up to their prestige."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice stay!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Gorgeous hotel. Perfect for our honeymoon. The staff was helpful and courteous. The room was clean and well stocked. We had a fabulous time there.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A very very pleasant experience-And at a reasonable price.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Personnel sympathique et serviable. bien situ��, proche des restaurants de Alexandria. Les enfants ont appr��ci�� la piscine et la salle de musculation."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It's a very nice hotel with a fine bar & restaurant attached. It's only 2 blocks from the heart of the fun nightlife and several good restaurants of Old Town Alexandria. The hotel is what you would expect from Kimpton.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Location is perfect and the stuff is very kindly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel.  nothing 5 star about it.  was very disappointed with the hotel..
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always love staying at a Kimpton!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Just back after four nights at the Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Great location. Easy walk to the Metro. We were surprised how nice the hotel was. Very clean. Excellent service. The 5-6 PM wine reception each night was great. We were somewhat concerned about the fact that the hotel welcomes pets - but our room was perfectly clean and the furniture in good condition. Alexandria is a super location to stay while visiting the Washington area. Short Metro ride to downtown Washington. Lots of restaurants on King Street. The shopping was good as well. We are planning to return next year at the same time.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco has an excellent location, nice modern rooms with comfortable bed and linens. We decided to move rooms when we realized a wedding reception had adjourned to the room next to ours and received excellent service in helping us make the room switch."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We really enjoy the entire Kimpton Hotel group. The Monaco in Alexandria is a gem! The location on King Street is in the middle of all the restaurants and walking distance to the water front. We stayed for New Year's Eve for Alexandria's First Night firework celebration and would do it again :). The staff is very friendly, the lobby is set up like you are in a comfy living room with of course, the traditional wine hour. The gym is fine but there is a great running / walking route along the water."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The front desk staff went the extra step to ensure our meeting ran smoothly - happy clients - thank you!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The team at the hotel took care of us like they had known us for years.  The customer service could not had been better.  A very pet friendly hotel.  Morning coffee and afternoon wine in the lobby was nice each day.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Alexandria area.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fantastic location. Wonderful service and ambiance.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was the luck of the draw that I picked the Monaco in downtown Alexandria. DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. I felt at ease walking along King St any time of the day or night."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great place awesome view from terrace. Room was great, just wish they would give you free wifi and a microwave...kinda a no brainer for the price."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Need exhaust fans in restrooms, coffee maker and coffee. Great lobby and great service"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Apart from the usual issues, as addressed in the numerical ratings above: the hotel staff here are some of the friendliest I have ever seen anywhere."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great walking access to lots of dining and shopping. Love the restaurant attached
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had to return the room key 4 times in 3 days, it stopped working. Otherwise I would recommend the hotel it was great, close to stores, restaurants and transportation. They are pet friendly and there was a good mix of people, I heard several languages spoken in the lobby."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent staff; courteous and extremely helpful. Perfect location. Nice touch with happy hour and free coffee for the guests. The attached restaurant is very good. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable and good pillows!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","great location very nice hotel we booked a delux king and it was big and comfortable the decor is very nice Vvery nice staff ,we will retrun"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotels.com post - and my confirmation email - said ""free wifi"". This was the deciding factor over a nearby hotel that appeared cheaper but charged $15 a day for wifi. Turns out wifi is free ONLY FOR KIMPTON REWARDS MEMBERS. And they mean it, and they stood by it when I checked out. Only the Hotels.com confirmation email, with the words ""free wifi"" in it, and my threat to write to Hotels about it, changed their minds. Anyway, beware. All that said... I love this hotel. Amazing neighborhood, great hotel restaurant and bar, and it's pretty reasonable for what you get."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice and clean hotel.  Comfortable bed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Top notch, enjoyable experience. Perfect place for a Old Towne visit."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Flew in for an early morning meeting in DC. Only stayed one night. It was lovely and I enjoyed the happy hour!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We checked in to escape a snowstorm. Noticing my very pregnant wife, they upgraded our room. They allowed us to extend our reservation as necessary during the storm. A great hotel made better by caring service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very beautiful hotel but very pricy.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great place to stay but be prepared for a $27./ day parking fee!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our stay was wonderful with the only exception being the lack of in-room coffee--a tiny factor overall. We met some fabulous canine guests!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was luxuriously appointed, quiet, and had lots of nice amenities (such as the free wine hour, even though I wasn't there to partake in it, and the offer to print boarding passes for you). However, I was disappointed by some very small touches that the hotel didn't provide, such as no shuttle transportation to the nearby (but not near enough) metro station and nowhere to park briefly (without cost) while one checks in. Still, I had a nice stay, and the neighborhood offers lots of interesting things to do and eat."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The location in Old Towne was very convenient and the service and comfort of the hotel was great. I would definitely go back.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location - perfect! Amenities - outstanding! Atmosphere - fabulous! This hotel is just terrific... we stayed in several hotels on our extended vacation and by far, this was the most comfortable from the bed to the air temp controls to the bath amenities. The service was fantastic. There was a great young woman at the front desk who was supremely helpful. The only odd thing is the coffee in the lobby is not available until 7am... 6am would have been nice. Other than that, this is a wonderful hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a beautiful hotel. Loved that it was so dog friendly (even though my pet was not with me).
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","excellent hotel in excellent location; great style and design, very comfortable, pet friendly too. only complains would be the music from their inner courtyard that kicks in at 5am (is that really necessary?) and the $50 resort fee, which is just a way to post a more competitive price online. for business this fee can be problematic as it is a separate charge, like the minibar, for which I will not be reimbursed. also, parking right across the street is much cheaper! otherwise 5 star all the way"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful hotel with excellent service that is welcoming and friendly, not judgmental and snooty. Those deep tubs are worth every penny. I only wish that there wasn't so much clutter about the room in the form of brochures and promotional cards, etc. These seem to be new, as the Kimpton Hotels company is growing. This was my second time at the hotel, and I enrolled in the hotel's parent company loyalty program for free because I have been so pleased with the service at Hotel Monaco Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel staff could not be more helpful. eventhough we were originally given a queen room instead of a king, the staff quickly rectified the situation and we loved our stay. The hotel is located right in the heart of Old Town which made it so easy to walk to all the shopping and restaurants. Very clean!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Perfectly located in Old Town on King Street. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, well-decorated and well-appointed (with a whimsical touch). The bathrobes were cheetah and zebra printed terry cloth, for example... It was great. Very convenient to Reagan National Airport and Washington, DC, too. We rode bikes to Mt. Vernon on the GW Parkway bike path which was walking distance from Hotel Monaco. All in all, pretty much perfect."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location was perfect for my purpose. Staff helpful, room comfortable and clean. Even got a daily NY Times! Would stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location! Fun area for shopping, dining and a quick trip to D.C."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location, History and wonderful services. The hotel provides a ""Goldfish"" on request from the front desk!!!Great Gym and Pool on the 3rd floor.Walk to all of the best restaurants and sights in ""Old Town"""
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Ok, I like dogs, but this is crazy. There were dogs everywhere, the patio, the lobby, at check in and check out. Not just a few, there were LOTs of dogs.The lobby was quite small and was always very busy, the hotel staff were awful. The room however, was clean, nicely done and very pleasant."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My overall experience was great. I loved the quirky decor. The 5pm wine reception was a nice touch. It was my birthday and they sent me a complimentary bottle of champagne and truffles. The room was very clean and the bed super comfortable. great hotel
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is amazing! Right in the middle of pedestrian friendly Old Town. The staff is great and the hotel is extremely clean. A bit pricey, but that is the only downside....but then again...you get what you pay for."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great service, nice rooms and friendly staff."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Went there to Old Town for quick weekend. Great place, great location in Old Town. The other hotels are more toward upper end by Metro (a mile)this Hotel in perfect spot. If you want Metro there is a free shuttle every 15 minutes up and down King Street. Get you there no problem. What a neat place the whole area full of food, Irish Bars,great shopping. I would definitely come back to this Hotel. I had a suite and it had a balcony( not much view but ok if you smoke or just enjoy)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","very nice, good rate, great location. AC unit was noisy but otw good experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We looked for a hotel in the heart of Old Town Alexandria within walking distance of Carlyle House. This was it! From Hotel Monaco airport pick up on, we were treated very well. Love the lobby, great sofas, chairs, well placed tables with access to coffee and other drinks in the morning, candy stand and games in the afternoon, followed by wine and appetizers in the evening (for about 2 hours per event each day). In the room, we requested a rollaway bed. The bathroom was supplied with full size shampoo, conditioner and bathing gel. The closet was small, however, as we were only staying 2 nights, it was adequate for our needs. Questions asked were researched, if needed. Answers were complete."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel in prime location. Plenty to do in Old Town Alexandria. Close to transport for easy access to Arlington or Washington. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Air conditioner a bit noisy but this seems to be common in the older buildings that have been renovated.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was a pleasant surprise. The location was great and the interior design was fun and comfortable. The service was great at both the front desk and when I needed something. The only complaint I have is the cost of room service. If you order a meal in to your room, they essentially charge you TWO fees. One of which I hadn't noticed before I ordered. Other than that, it was a great place to stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Dejligt hotel og super service. Fin morgenmad i restaurant ved siden af
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room and service where great. During the night, the AC made terrible vibrating noises. Did not sleep very well. Did not want to call the front desk at that time of night, also did not want to have to get dressed in the middle of the night."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Prior to arriving at the Hotel Monaco, I tried to change some elements of the reservation -- and we had made reservations for TWO rooms for multiple days. It took me more than an hour to get to the right person.Upon our arrival, we checked in as usual -- it's been a good choice in the past. But on the first morning, we were informed that "" 'THE' coffee pot was inoperative,"" so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities. I was told that I could wait until a local Starbucks opened and purchase coffee there. Hmmmm??? Or, could Hotel Monaco have obtained coffee from a local vendor to meet their promise to customers? A ""broken"" coffee pot was not my problem -- but theirs.We travel to Alexandria every two months or so, and we're re-thinking our next stay, despite the Hotel Monaco's desirable location."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Front desk had no idea what they were doing, took 3 people just to check me in, and they were giving each other dirty looks because they kept stepping over each other.Room decor was mismatched and random.Over priced for nothing.. 3rd time I have stayed at kimpton properties, won't do a 4th."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Monaco. We plan to stay there every time we're in Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I usually enjoy Kimpton Hotels, and the Monaco has great potential, however it is also a favorite spot for weddings, and apparently they are not staffed well enough to keep things under control, leaving non-wedding guests suffering. There were children lacking appropriate adult suervision galloping up and down my hall, dogs left alone in rooms and barking incessantly, and all the manager could tell me was they would send someone up to check, the dogs' owners' had been called...blah blah blah. By 10 pm I had given up and tried to find another local room but none could be found for me. The manager assured me the wedding was over at 11, however that just happened to be when the die-hards moved the party to the courtyard; drunken guests whooping it up and taking flash photos. I had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to sleep early that night; I finally passed out at 1 am. My night was comped when I spoke to the day manager in the morning, but the damage was done. The wedding party was obviously the priority to the night manager, who completely failed the rest of the guests in his charge. I MAY give the place another chance, during the week, but probably not."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Friendly, helpful staff....great, comfortable room."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very clean and nice hotel in the heart of Historic Alexandria. The customer service was excellent, we asked for a crib for the baby and they brought it right up, within minutes. Very attentive!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",OUT OF 4 OF THE BEST HOTELS I HAVE STAYED AT.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is the second Thanksgiving in a row that my family has stayed at the Hotel Monaco. Great location and great services! Thank you!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Old Town is an awesome place to visits. Very historic! Quiet, and clean."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a great place to stay and in a great location. The staff was helpful and pleasant. We would be hard-pressed to complain.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The location is very close to old town Alexandria and the price was nice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I took a trip out to D.C. and stayed at the Kimpton Hotel in Alexandria.  Although the walk to the metro is about 20 min, the nightlife in Alexandria was more than exciting.  We wanted a nice restaurant to eat at for our anniversary and the desk attendents took care of everything for us.  They set up reservations for us at the Chart House on the Potomac River and ordered us a desert on them.  We also had menus printed out with our name on top saying congratulations.  The staff was incredible and we would stay at any Kimpton hotel again if the experience was like the one we had."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was great. The rooms are very large and the staff is fantastic.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved the hotel but you will pay for parking.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my birthday and I came back to my room to a cupcake and bottle of wine. A nice touch! Room was spacious and the bed was huge and comfortable. Ordered room service and dinner (bbq salmon, Mac n cheese, and collard greens) was better than expected."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Overall outstanding stay! Staff was friendly and helpful. Nice tea and coffee bar set up in the morning. Would most definitley stay here again when I am in Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were extremely pleased with the personal and truly caring attitudes of the staff and the value of the stay.  The valet parking kept our truck safe and was very convenient...The only downside of the stay was minor-the handicapped bathroom was impossible to keep dry.  The water ran out of the shower enclosure and soaked the entire floor.  We will stay here again for sure!!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is great but the restaurant leaves a bit to be desired.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",To our surprise at check in we were upgraded to a suite!   Hotel itself is beautiful!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",nicely decorated room. free yoga session a bonus
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our hotel stay was fabulous. The staff was terrific. They even sent my husband and I an anniversary card and a complimentary gift in honor of our anniversary. This is a four star hotel that treated us like 5 star quests.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent staff - helpful and professional. A pleasure to stay at this hotel and probably the best experience I've had in USA
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",dogs in lobby and dry rotted tearing linen on bed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We took the metro to Washington DC almost every day to take in the sites.  We spent our down time wandering around ""old town"" and had a great time.  We took the ferry to Mt Vernon for a day.  I have never seen so much red brick or green countryside in any one place before being from Fresno, California.  The hotel staff was very, very helpful everyday during our stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very lovely hotel. Great service. Comfortable bed. Big room. However, too far from the metro station and the free shuttle doesn't begin service until 11:30. The restaurant next door not worth going to."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","El hotel esta bien ubicado, esta en un area cerca de restaurantes, es muy seguro y traquilo su ubicaci��n. Lo recomiendo."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I absolutely loved everything about this hotel. It was totally unique and definitely my style. I visited with 2 dogs, and the staff were so helpful and even remembered my name every time I came in and out. The lobby, elevators, hallways, everything is all gorgeous. Really great designer. Check in/out was easy. Only problem I have with this hotel is that they charged me 164$ when I left. I haven't called yet to ask what this was for. I did park overnight for one night and I did use the internet for one day, but that doesn't seem to add up to almost 200$. That's the only reason I didn't rate 5 stars."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","What a treat. From the welcoming, bright and comfortable lobby to the exceptionally friendly valet and concierge staff - we enjoyed every minute. Breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and the service prompt. The location is perfect. We loved this hotel and will definitely return when possible."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Cool location. Clean hotel room with great character.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is nothing short is amazing! It is beautiful, clean, perfectly located, and clean! The list could go on and on.The only minor complaint I have is that the bed could be a little less hard"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I have stayed at Kimpton hotels often and this is the only one that did not make the grade.   Many other Alexandria hotels are by far superior!  This property is a former Holiday Inn and it still unfortunately felt like it.  I will stay at other hotels when I get back to Alexandria and will not consider this one.  This is so far below the standards of the DuPont Circle Palomar that I was shocked.  Unfortunately This will probably lead me to not consider other Kimpton hotels I have not seen before I stay at them.  The hotel was way way overpriced for what it is.  The chain needs to fix this one because it brings down the entire Kimpton reputation. They have a great King Street location but that is all.  The hotel did not even offer free newspapers--inexcusable for the price.  I left after one night and  spent the next four nights in a nearby hotel that was everything this one was not--and I paid $100 a night less.  This is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Set in beautiful Old Town, the setting for this hotel is quite calming and as a dog-friendly establishment, bringing fido was another plus... however, all the outdoor beauty and stylish hotel esthetics cannot mask how awful our customer service/staff experience was. From requesting room service, or inquiring about an AC issue, nothing was timely. Most of the time we had to call back after 30 minutes to ask for service again otherwise it wouldn't have come!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco Alexandria is a recently remodeled hotel in the heart of Downtown Alexandria, VA.Our room was well styled, very clean and much nicer than rooms we have paid much more for in the past. We did not use its restaurant.There were simultaneus wedding receptions going on so the atmosphere was both busy and festive. We parked in a garage only a block away for $12 for one night. Doorman, room service and check in agents were all nice and professional.The 3PM check in time was not altered due to our early arrival but we did not mind the 30 minute wait. There were free refreshments in the lobby."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice hotel. I was able to have a goldfish brought up to the room (just for the fun of it). We had our old dog with us and it was hard to find grass for him to use the bathroom.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, very friendly staff, clean, courteous, professional and comfortable. well appointed. Would definitely stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel...already referred it to friends...planning a second visit...staff was great!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very funky little hotel... the only thing(s) I'd change would be to have a small coffee maker in the room and maybe a complimentary bottle of water because the tap water tastes terrible and there is no mini-bar. Otherwise great, we plan on returning very soon."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","For those not taking pets along with you on the road, this hotel is probably more of a 4 than a 3.We never got the advertised amenities for our dog even though we clearly checked in with her when we arrived at the hotel. Complimentary dog bags were provided (only when we asked for them), but nowhere near the level of service advertised for our four-legged companion.The internet at the hotel is not complimentary. They make you sign up for their rewards program to have access to the internet at their hotel. (A minor pain admittedly, but when one is in a hurry, it's a completely unnecessary hassle)."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Although a ways from DC, this hotel's value can't be beat. Beautiful design, spacious rooms and excellent ammenities. Plus Old Town is charming in it's own right, not to mention the good food & coffee within the hotel and nearby."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, you can walk to the Metro and any kind of food you want.  Very comforable hotel with a very professional staff.  You won't go wrong with staying here."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Second time staying here -- one of the most dog friendly cities and this hotel loves dogs!! My pet felt happy and welcome. Room clean comfy :) staff friendly extended my checkout time upon special request. Overall great experience And yes will stay again !
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I visit the Hotel Monaco Alexandria every spring and am always impressed! Great service, great location, great hotel!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was beautiful. Rooms were well kept and staff was a delight.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We loved the hotel and the staff was great but where our room was located it was extremely noisy. There was a staff entrance near our door on the 2nd floor and I think that was the source.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at this hotel for our visit to DC. It was perfect because it was a short drive to DC. Restaurants, shopping, blues bar all in walking distance."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Best hotel in Old Town Alexandria! Quality is consistent across the country too.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel was pretty on the surface. Mattress was not luxury. AC was so loud had to literally turn it off. Walls paper thin and doors need to be cushioned so they don't slam.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Perfect stay. Will go again
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staff was top notch. It's expensive, but then again the whole town is so you should already be aware of that.Great if you have pets. My kids spent their time in the pool which has a lifeguard on duty a nice feature if you are looking after more then one kid."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",service was great but they seem to be skimpy with the shampoo and towels.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Comfortable hotel. Very clean and quiet. It's older, but kept up very well. Only down side is workout room is small and heat was set at 72 which was too warm. My room was near a storage room and people in there were very load at 5:30am and woke me up. There must have been shelves against the wall of my bed and they were so loud and aggressive that my bed was shaking."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved the location and service. Very pet friendly. Excellent restaurant. Nice happy hour! Many great restaurants and fast walk to the river walkway. Easy access to free trolley and metro.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent. Rooms are very spacious and clean. Overall high quality hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is in the heart of Old Towne Alexandria which made it very easy to walk to the different shops and historical sites in the area-not needing a rental car or having to pay for parking. Uber was accessed a couple of times when going to DC and Mount Vernon. This is our 2nd time to stay at Hotel Monaco over the Thanksgiving Day weekend.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We stayed here to attend a convention in the National harbour. Our room was a little dusty in a few spots but otherwise everything appeared clean. The people at the front desk were especially polite and courteous. If we stay in the area again this will likely be our first choice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","A great old hotel in an historic location, convenient for shopping, dinning, and historic site visits. We were very impressed by the door staff, bellmen and desk staff. We were less impressed by the limited storage in our room (we stayed for a week), the lack of towel bars in the bath, and the chilly temps in the bathroom. Otherwise, the room was wonderful. We would be happy to stay there again in the future.I hate the trend toward duvets in place of blankets. It is nearly impossible to make the room cool enough at night to make the duvet usable. Without it's cover, of course, the sleeper is too cold to be comfortable. Hence, a night in bed is a constant process of pushing down and pulling up the duvet.The wine reception each afternoon is a very nice touch."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is beautifully furnished. I was particularly impressed with the hotel having a humidifer and accessories like this available to us. I would definitely recommend a stay here.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We booked this hotel through Expedia's unpublished rates section, so we thought it might be a bit of a gamble... well, the gamble paid off. This hotel is simply delightful. The unique decor sets it apart from other cookie cutter hotels, and our room was spacious and comfortable. The best feature is its proximity to the high street shopping district with TONS of restaurants. It is also only a few blocks from the waterfront. During our stay we enjoyed some lovely walks though old town and along the Patomac and we never needed to get our car from the garage! I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco Alexandria - a Kimpton Hotel, Alexandria, Virginia was such a lovely place to stay!! This hotel was in a great location, it was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I plan on going again!!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed in a king deluxe room. The location is perfect. Many restaurants and bars within walking distance. 15-20 minute drive to DC. Hotel rooms are very clean and one of the biggest rooms I've stayed in. Bed was very comfortable. Large marble bathroom. The heated indoor swimming pool on the third floor was a major plus. Definitely check it out if you are bored of the ""classic"" hotel look."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved the Hotel Monaco! Great location, clean, very comfy room and the employees we dealt with were all extremely friendly. Would definitely stay here again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Lovely, charming place.  Good location.  Worst bed I've ever slept on.  The mattress was about 12"" deep on one side, 3"" on the other.  If you get that room, insist they move you!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a fun boutique hotel with lots of little extra touches that make it above average and the location is fantastic. Service was really great, everyone was very friendly and helpful. A word of caution: if you don't like dogs, don't stay here. The hotel is very dog friendly - and although it is very clean, there is only so much they can do to cover up some of the dog scents."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Chic and comfortable hotel that is right in the heart of Old Town. Excellent customer service. Rooms are a bit small but the decor is modern.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a pleasant boutique hotel within walking distance to the waterfront. I found it to be quiet, clean, and comfortable. I would go back."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was a great experience in particular due to the colorful decor, availability of bicycles and pet policy. Now I look for a Kimpton or Monaco hotel when traveling!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Très belle décoration originale (comme régulièrement dans les hotels Kimpton), service impeccable, excellent confort. Par ailleurs, idéalement situé pour commencer une visite à pied des bâtiments d'Alexandria ou juste pour aller au restau, sur bord de Potomac ou dans la rue principale. La note moyenne mise par les voyageurs n'est pas usurpée !"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great atmosphere, close to everything in Old Town. Hip decor, big room and bathroom."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Restaurant and bar ? Go elsewhere.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Washington, DC's hidden gem in the Historic District of Old Town Alexandria. Professional and friendly staff with excellent amenities. Has its own professional historian on site. Whimsical design and caters to pet owners whom have had to leave their pets home by providing a pet fish for your stay. Excellent restaurant on site and fast and wonderful room service. In-room spa services available."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My Family came to the DC Area to attend the Monday Night Football Game between the Redskins and the Browns... My Daughter was cheerleading at the game and my Fianc�� and her son had never been to DC before. This was my first time staying at the Monaco and I was very impressed from the moment I arrived and walked through the doors, the staff was very friendly and helpful, there is a trolley to and from the Metro station and the Blue line that runs directly to the Arlington Cemetery, Washington Mall, and all the way to FEDEX Field for the Game.... in our 5 day stay we enjoyed the nightly wine tasting and the assistance from the staff with a few business issues I had to deal with Olina at the front desk is Fantastic she is smart, efficient and handles business with a level of professionalism that you don't usually see in a young lady these days. All in all I will be a regular with Hotel Monaco from this point forward. Thank you all we will be back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was written in a review recently that there was a definite odor to the Hotel...I can't speak for anyone else, but I found no odors what so ever and I consider my smell sensitive.The room was beautiful, clean, neat and very comfortable and the staff was great. I had a queen bed with a balcony...very nice. No coffee/tea in the room but there is a fridge with asst refreshments to purchase and coffee/tea down stairs in the AM. The hotel is centrally located in an adorably quaint town close to DC. There is a FREE trolly riding up and down King St every 15-20 min stopping on every 2 blocks for your convience. They are all brick sidewalks so wear walking shoes, not heels....I recommend and would go back"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent accomodations. I needed to ""trust"" that Expedia would get me a four-star room for the right price...and they did! Thanks."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I love Kimpton's idea of what a hotel should be. None of them are stuffy. This is the 6th Kimpton hotel we've stayed at and probably our favorite. For a romantic get-away it can't be beat. Relaxed, attentive service set a great tone for the weekend. For a business trip, the service is professional and efficient and give me what I need to relax in a hotel. Hotel Monaco in Old Town Alexandria executed perfectly on all levels to make our stay really nice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were very pleased with the accommodations and decor.  Although there were dogs at the property we were not bothered by them at all.  We requested a room on a pet free floor. Cheap parking is available at the courthouse parking lot across from the hotel. We paid $10 for 2 days at the lot. Great deal!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was very satisfied and happy with this hotel.  Sleeping room and bathroom were clean and spacious.  Wine party and tea and coffee in the lobby were nice touches.

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great hotel and great place to stay except for the fact that they put us in a room surrounded by guests with dogs, which woke us up throughout the night and early in the morning."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We enjoyed staying here for a planned 3 night trip. We were so satisfied with our stay that when our vacation plans changed, partly due to airline cancellation, we booked two more nights at the Monaco. Highly recommend a stay here."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Awesome hotel! I will come back and stay here again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",classy hotel with so much to do. All with in walking distance.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great mid town location and close to all the sights.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had a wonderful time. I loved the location and the room. The dinner at the restaurant was delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",First time to Washington DC. Everyone very helpful and friendly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I've stayed at Hotel Monaco before, and it was great. This time it was a little less great, but still good. Got stuck in the farthest room (didn't even know these rooms existed) from the elevator in a mid-week stay. I could have taken all of my luggage back downstairs and requested another room, I guess, but I was tired. Annoying that there are no coffee makers in the rooms. Carpeting is looking pretty worn. But--nice bed, great location, and generally very friendly and helpful staff."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Cute hotel in convenient location. Trolley stop across the street from hotel. only negative thing about this hotel is they allow dogs ... dogs bark early in the morning
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel is in perfect location close to restaurants and shopping
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was in town for a funeral and stayed one night only. However, it was a pleasant experience from the minute I stepped into the hotel. Staff (from the complimentary airport pick up/drop off, doorman, front desk, etc.) are friendly and professional. They also print out my departure boarding pass for the following day at no charge. (you can request a form to fill out at the front desk). The room decor has a unique historic setting yet modern color pattern which give a fresh and luxury look. It's also clean with big mirrors, sufficient lighting and space to feel relax and comfortable. One down side of the room is air conditioner is loud if it's on at night. One small part occur during my stay make this hotel stand out from the others. After the funeral I return to the hotel for a quick change, I was handed with a cool hand towel at the lobby. It was certainly a surprise yet appreciated during that hot afternoon. They also have ice tea available at the lobby and ice popsicle for the kids too. (during certain hour though). Nice lobby and courtyard to hang out and chat with friends. I will definitely come back and bring the family for a longer stay and explore Old Town Alexandria and nearby Washington DC. in the near future."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel has a great location on King Street. Great food and drink options near by, and nice hotel bar. Good service overall. Easy to access from Reagan airport by taxi, Metro and free King Street trolley, or Uber."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Monaco is right in the middle of old town within walking distance of everything cool that you'd want to see or try. They do charge for parking and internet but worth it
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is my favorite place to stay. The people working there all make me feel like a billion bucks!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staff was unbelievable and wanted to make sure your every need was met. They knew our names by the time we checked out of the hotel. The location in Old Town Alexandria was wonderful. It is within walking distance to shopping and dining, and there was a free trolley to transport you to the metro line which was then only 20-30 minute commute to DC. The rooms were spacious, and the onsite dining was great. My husband and I enjoyed the complimentary wine and appetizers each evening, and my daughter loved attending the ""doggy happy hours."" This was our first time at a Kimpton hotel, but it definitely will not be our last."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This must be a well known dog hotel. Unfortunately, I was one of the few who didn't know that in advance. There were many, many yappy dogs early in the morning and late at night. Great if you have a dog, but not so great if you weren't planning on a bark fest.Also, the room service continental breakfast was pretty sad ... cold coffee and old pastries. We should have wandered to the amazing Farmer's Market which runs every Saturday morning across the street at City Hall.And finally, there was no hot water for a few hours in the morning.I've stayed at the Morrison House (a sister property a few blocks away) and found it a notch above in all respects. It was booked on this night or I would have stayed there."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel had a really nice vibe to it. Pets are allowed are certain floors and, even though I didn't have a pet, I thought it was fun to have them around and welcomed. They weren't a problem at all.Location is fantastic. Great for walking around, seeing the Old Town area, and doing a little window shopping.I also liked the manager's reception each night. It was great to mingle with the other guests while sipping on a complimentary glass of wine. All in all, a very good experience. Would definitely go back."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Overall the hotel was a bust, from a surprise parking fee, to a dirty shower, to the homeless folk, sleeping in the doorway outside. I was very much unimpressed. The super uncomfortable mattress was just icing on the cake."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We were concerned about the cost of parking in Old Town Alexandria, but the hotel bellman mentioned that the Visitors Center provided free parking passes."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","charming, unique hotel. appreciated the wine in the lobby . Very helpful staff"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I have stayed here a few times because I love everything about it. Cleanliness, friendly, gorgeous and wonderful location of King Street. After staying at several of the hotels on King Street for comparison, I am happy to say this one is my favorite."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great service, cozy, clean & in the heart of everything - great location!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel with interesting interior, roomy pool. Our room was small but very neat."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco was an excellent choice in a superb location. Originally booked our mini vacation for 2 days and extended a day longer. We didn't want to leave!!! The hotel is located right in the middle of Old Town and everything was within walking distance from the hotel. We were also traveling with 2 dogs and had no problems with them during our stay. My only complaint is the lack of grass for the babies to go do their ""business"" in around the hotel. We had to walk a couple blocks up to this one strip of grass for bathroom breaks. There are parks down by the water, but for late nite runs it would've been nice if we could have taken them to the courtyard for a quickie. Maybe they can invest in remodeling it in the future to accommodate their pet friendly status. Overall, it was an excellent stay with beautiful rooms and a very curtious and helpful staff. Highly recommended!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Comfortable room
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I stay at dozens of upscale hotels every year. This hotel is being renovated and ought to be closed until those renovations are complete. I can not exaggerate how lousy my stay was.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The location is perfect (in the old town, a few blocks from the water), the staff is wonderful, and the room was excellent (large, comfortable, well appointed and clean). Moreover, it was much cheaper than other hotels in the area. I will certainly return to this hotel, if I'm in the area again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our stay was delightful. While the hotel is clean and nicely appointed...don't miss the wine reception! The lobby furniture could use a bit of freshening. Overall...highly recommend!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","An enjoyable location, a long walk from where I was doing business but worth it for the after hours ambiance of King Street by the river."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This place was awesome!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I really enjoyed the location, it was so close to the main street that runs through old town Alexandria. You could walk right out of the hotel and up and down King St to many stores, restaurants, bars, and the water. There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. Other than that I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Enjoyed the Monaco again. We have stayed there several times in the past. The staff is friendly and informative as well as helpful.We did request a Queen bed but since we arrived late in the evening only rooms with 2 Double Beds were available. Not a big deal but would have liked a room with a queen size bed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice hotel within walking distance of the metro and lots of great tourists sites.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Friendly staff.  Would definitely stay there on my next trip to Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was beautiful with great amenities. Several (not all) of the staff were not very friendly or accommodating. Snobbish and rude.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Extremely clean rooms and great service. Only complaint is the pool operation hours.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It's a good place. It is very obviously pet friendly, a lot of dogs. The hotel was clean. The staff at the hotel were friendly, helpful and professional. As opposed to the staff at the adjoining restaurant, Jackson 20. Those folks were immature, inattentive and unprofessional. Too bad, because the food is decent. They could benefit from some front of the house training.Overall, though ,we had a good experience at this hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were initially given an accessible room upon arrival. The room was fine except for the handicap shower which flooded the bathroom floor when my wife showered. I notified the front desk of the issue and they sent an employee to check the problem. The desk then called back and gave us another room without hesitation which we grateful for since their were a couple of weddings at the hotel that weekend. Overall very happy with the experience.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It's always a pleasure to stay at the Monaco in Alexandria. The room wa great, staff is very nice and the neighborhood is also great."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very friendly staff, location to free trolley on King street helped to get to the Metro for trip to DC. Price for parking should be included in hotel cost. Nice breakfast foods. Our room had a nice view of the court yard, but my brother's roomlooked into a trashy alley."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fantastic Hotel with all anyone could ask for in Downtown Alexandria!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was a pleasant hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",O único porém do hotel é com relação ao aluguel de carro: muito caro para deixar estacionado o veículo no parking do hotel. De resto: gostei muito.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a fine enough place to stay. The hotel could use a little modernization, but it would not keep me from going back if i needed to be in Alexandria for business"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel was located in a convenient area for old town area of Alexandria. it has been updated beautifully and was extremely dog friendly. I was most impressed by the staff, which was welcoming and attentive in every way. A welcome respite after a long drive!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","we loved the location of the hotel and the staff were very friendly...what I did not like about the room was that when we first walked in it smelled musty (but they did fix it after I told them about it), one of the windows was stuck so I can only open one (very noisy from the road), and the vent in the bathroom was not working (which made the bathroom and the room hot after taking showers).......other than that the room was comfortable....honestly, I did expect a little better for $500.00/two nights"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel in a nice location. Very attentive staff. Lovely lobby with great decor. Morning coffee in lobby was terrible and weak. The staff provided an in room coffee maker free of charge when we asked for one. There was a wedding group at the hotel which was incredibly noisy on both Thursday and Friday night--shouting in the hall ways at 1 am, 2am and 4 am...a bit annoying that the staff couldn't control the noise."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Best location and lovely area, safe and friendly. Great. Shopping and things to see."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great facilities (including outstanding on-site restaurant - best breakfast in Old Town), excellent service and exceedingly comfortable room added up to a superior travel experience. We look forward to returning soon."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",If you are staying in Old Town and are not afraid to spend a little money then this is the hotel for you. The Monaco is located almost smack dab in the middle of Old Town. It is a great location for walking down to the river or for heading towards the metrorail. It is right on King Street so eateries and shops greet you almost immediately as you walk out the front doors.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was a phenominal stay for my girlfriend and me. The hotel was in great condition, the staff was VERY friendly. I ended up getting very sick while I was there, and the hotel did everything they could to make my stay as painless as possible. I would highly recommend this hotel to folks visiting Old Town, and we will absolutely stay here again. Thanks to the hotel for a great experience!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was a pleasant experience, the wait staff was quite helpful throughout the night. The room was immaculate and well stocked with all types of extras that might have been forgotten. I would highly recommend it and would stay there again"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel is great. It has a comfy room that is well decorated. The location in Old Town Alexandria is convenient to walk to shopping and food.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",this is an annual October reunion in Alexandria. On prior visits we have stayed at large hotels on other end of King Street near the Masonic Temple. We will opt for Monaco or Lorien on all future trips. Very guest friendly.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A wonderful experience. No not miss this one! It is located in a part of Alexandria that has everything at your doorstep. Resturants so diverse that you will be sorry to leave the area. The rooms were inviting and very clean. The staff did everything to make you feel that you were important and that they were glade to see you.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The old Holiday Inn Alexandria has been given a top-to-bottom update as a the Kimpton Monaco. Very comfortable, very well-done."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Near shops and excellent restaurants. Staff is super friendly and helpful!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great experience. Will definitely stay here again!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything makes you feel at home, especially that you can bring your do with you and know that he is welcome."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Booked online,  showed up and was given a different room to what I had requested . Also TV in room was broken."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I don't want to leave a lengthy review - suffice it to stay, if you're on the fence, book a room. It is very elegant, the staff is extremely hospitable, and the location is top notch. My only complaint is that they charge $20/Day for parking, but that's easily fixed by parking around the corner (plenty of spots at night!)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The service was excellent!! Everyone was very friendly and helpful! Our room was big with an oversized chair and king bed. The hotel is 12 blocks from the Metro-an easy walk or they have a shuttle. I would definatly stay here again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel Monaco was absolutely phenomenal and provided the highest quality service to both the human and canine guests. The front desk was warm and inviting and the room was five star quality. The hotel provided our dog with her own doggy bag and provided ample pet friendly information for the surrounding area. Having had bad experiences with other hotel chains (i.e. Marriot) we cannot express enough our thanks to the Hotel Monaco and Kimpton Hotels as a whole. There is no doubt we will seek out this chain of hotels for all of our future travels.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel located in ideal place to explore Alexandria, VA. Walking distance to all attractions (marina, park, all places on King St, etc.). Hotel is next door to Saturday Market...Staff extremely helpful and accommodating.Restaurant very good...Parking convenient but expensive..."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I could go on and on..... I won't. Totally awesome hotel and location.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I thought the room rates were a little pricy for the amenities offered. The room did not include a microvave, which would have been useful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Not too bad of a place. Definitely wouldn't pay the full $500 the site says they normally run. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were way to soft. Great location though.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Was a wonderful location to Potomac river and all the walking and bike paths was great.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",While we watched tv in our room the tv would turn off randomly. The room beside us had a dog and it continuously barked. The parking was horrible!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location,location,location.  Whimsical, swanky, yet not a budget buster on price, even has a pool!  Hotel is located in the middle of the ""scene"" in Old Town Alexandria.  Super convenient to lots of restaurants - from budget to high end.  Shopping possibilities abound if that's what you want.  Free shuttle runs to the metro staion 10 blocks away.  Metro to anywhere in DC.  Loved it."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Updated HotelWalking distance to old townFriendly service
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",it was ok
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel is very well located. Easy access to restaurants, shopping, art museum and harbor. Staff was extremely cordial and helpful. The room was lovely!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is my second time staying here and I like where it is in Old Alexandria. However, the bathrooms and showers could use a facelift. The beds were too soft and lacked support underneath. Very nice staff"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",good experience. clean and comfortable. staff is very sweet and professional.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The facility was good and the location was convenient. I had room service that was excellent.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice hotel, convenient to all the things nice in Old Town Alexandria, VA.  Great alternative hotel stay if you plan to visit the new MGM National Harbor Casino...super easy cab or drive to MGM.   Clean, spacious hotel room ( courtyard view room).  Very friendly hotel staff...very pleased with my choice in hotels."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My best stay in the past 20 travels (2 years). The room was really clean. It had a minibar full of items (I love munching on snacks   prices were really good)Parking was the only thing ($27/night) which I guess is normal for that area.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel is in a great location. The staff was exceptionally nice and helpful. I would stay again and recommend this hotel. Our room was small and did not have an easy chair. Overall a pleasant experience.

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved it! Excellent ratings for: room, service, comfort, cleanliness, location, parking. The whole thing was great and fun. Perfect for a night out in Old Towne Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is centrally located on King street and has very attentive staff. Free shuttle to Reagan International is a great plus. The Jackson 20 restaurant adjoining has excellent presentation meals, and very nicely prepared. Hotel is quiet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We spent Easter weekend at Hotel Monaco with our dog, and we all had a lovely time. The daily wine reception gave us the opportunity to meet other people and other dogs from all over the country. The Old Town location was superb; we were within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and other attractions. The staff was friendly and gracious; they couldn't do enough for us. We felt so much at home at the Monaco, we were reluctant to leave. We definitely would stay at this hotel again and would heartily recommend it to others."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It's a modern motif but structurally old so there were some minor issues, like the heating system was kind of loud. Woke me up more than once. Parking was expensive. But, for the location & the price, I would stay there again."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","jRight in the heart of Alexandria. Lots of restaurants and stores nearby. Cheerful, warm lobby and good service. Morning coffee in the lobby which is always nice. Good design and service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We spent one night prior to attending a family wedding in Quantico. Greeting as we pulled up was friendly as was the check in process. Room was small, bed uncomfortable and when I sat on the end it tipped forward. Bath sink was clogged. Staff in hotel dining room was excellent as was the food. Neighborhood great for walking, shopping and dining. Check out easy and friendly. Overnight parking charge seemed ridiculous especially when paying such a high price for a room."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Our room wasn't ready at check-in and we were given a free upgrade so we could get settled. Front desk staff made great recommendations for local restaurants. Hotel was clean, comfortable, and the bath robes were hillarious. I look forward to staying at Hotel Monaco again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",no complaints
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is on ""the"" street to be on in old town- King Street! The beds were super comfortable. No in-room coffee or in-hotel vending machines (soft drinks) were slight minuses. Great place for breakfast (and lunch for that matter) next door at La Madaline's!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Good room, good location, good pool. Just what I needed!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was the perfect hotel for our stay. The rooms were great, decor upscale and the overall ambiance perfect for our visit to the heart of Old Town. Don't overlook the complimentary airport shuttle service and daily wine tasting."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel was fabulous.  The style and setting of the hotel is fitting for Old Town Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was nice and clean. It had a nice old time feel perfectly mixed with modern amenities. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and walking distance to many restaurants and shops. It was also only around 7-8 miles from downtown DC. I'm definitely coming back :)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Location was awesome. Everything was great. I recommend it.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Not super fancy, but nice enough. Good location - nice to grab breakfast at the farmer's market across the street."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Exceptional staff. Beautiful, cozy room with unique design. Wished to have been closer to a metro stop."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was thoroughly enjoyable and a charming treat for both my husband and I, as well as our 2 boys (7 & 11). Kids hour at 4pm, followed by wine hour at 5pm, allowed us all to feel as though we were welcomed guests. The pool was kept at a comfortable temperature and we spent many hours there during the week. Would stay here over and over again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Could not have had a better time or a better place to stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Amazing...Beautiful decor and atmosphere. Super nice staff...soooo accomodating! Offered many small special things like a personal live fish for my daughter and chalk board, her own little animal print robe. I stuffed dog with story book for her to enjoy. The complimentary wine hour was such a nice treat and social event. Pool was great...Cant wait to go back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Attended the wedding of our daughter's friend. The hotel did an excellent job with the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. Thoroughly enjoyable. Our room was well appointed, but could have used an additional easy chair for both balance esthetically and for comfort. The desk chair and easy chair worked, but wasn't ideal for conversation. The restaurant was bustling in the morning and the wait staff hustled, but couldn't really keep up with the demand."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at the Monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was in the heart of Old Town, making it a great location for visiting Alexandria, with just a stroll down to the waterfront. The hotel decor gave it a stylish boutique feel and it was a great place to come back to after a day at a conference or shopping. A nice touch was the complimentary wine social hour in the lobby each evening. Guests participation was high, creating a lively social vibe. Eat at Restaurant Eve, right around the corner on Pitt Street for high-end craft cocktails, stellar service and ambiance, and some of the best dining in Old Town."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","H��tel tr��s bien situ��, proche du Potomac et sur la rue commer��ante King. Accueil tr��s sympatique. Cet h��tel est dog friendly, et bien que nous n'ayions pas de chien, cela ne nous a nullement g��n��. �� recommander."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Sehr empfehlenswertes, zudem hundefreundliches Hotel an bester Lage mitten in Old Town Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always nice. Staff is great.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always nice. Staff is great.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Loved the robes they provide you with, the bathroom floors were a bit chilly (they were made of marble).  The bed was very comfortable and we were very happy with our choice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Was perfec
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is right on King Street, so it's easy to explore Old Town Alexandria by foot.  The front desk clerk who checked me in made me feel welcome not only in the hotel but also in the city by giving me a brief summary of the attractions near the hotel (waterfront, shops).  My room was lovely: clean, lots of light, and plenty of outlets.  Although I'm not a Marriott rewards member, they gave me the WiFi password so I could access internet in my room.  I only stayed here for one night, but I would definitely recommend it to others."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We loved the Monaco. Convenient to everything. Front desk staff was terrific.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Ritzy place. Wide screen HD TV in the room. Valet parking is required and costs $20 per day. Great location.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Top notch decorating and ambiance, very clean, comfortable, nice bed linens...quiet for the most part. I had one bad evening where a party was down the hall at 2 a.m. The hotel staff was fairly responsive, though the party-throwers were not! The location was excellent for exploring Alexandria, accessing DC and other sights like Mt Vernon."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel was great!My dog was treated like a true guest - greeted with dog treats!Location is perfect to explore Old Town Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great time, enjoyed the wine hour in the early evening. The only thing I didn't like was the coffee that was out out in the mornings, truly watered down- and I wouldn't be fm difficult if they didn't advertise it as artisan coffee. Spend less money on the cool design on the cups, and more on the quality of the coffee."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was lovely and the staff could not have been nicer. Unfortunately we had to check out early due to illness. They were able to refund us our second night without question. We will definitely go back and enjoy the hotel and Alexandria again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Seriously, the employees at this hotel, the front desk to the housekeepers to the doormen, are some of the friendliest, most competent, helpful and conscientious folks we have found. We travel quite alot, and we find this hotel to be world class! Great location in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, one can be entertained, wined & dined for days within walking distance, no car required. Dog friendly, but you'd never know there are dogs except for seeing them in the lobby... Fun! Room amenities were wonderful... cushy bed/pillows/bedding, big screen TV, stylish furnishings, trendy decor and high end finishes. The lobby is so well appointed with decor and fireplace that people use it regularly to relax! Free coffee/tea/hot chocolate in mornings, free wine in afternoon. Wow, we love this place, and definitely will be back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My company HQ having moved to Crystal City from DC provided me with an excellent opportunity to get away from the usual Georgetown or Dupont Circle haunts and I was very glad I did.The Hotel Monaco (there's a sister hotel in DC near the Mall) was quirky but comfortable and the room, while a little small by normal US standards, was unusually designed, well appointed and extremely comfortable, with free, fast WiFi for the workers among us. The staff were all helpful without being gushing and the hotel was well positioned for the excellent restaurants of Old Town Alexandria. If you're a dog lover this is a great place to be - they have doggie happy hours twice a week when our canine chums can bring their owners along for a pre-dinner drink. Old Town Alexandria itself is a friendly place just a few stops on the Metro from National Airport and onwards to DC. Lots of shops and restaurants and very pleasant just for a stroll around - a welcome relaxation after a busy working day, you could almost be home."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Super stay in Old Town. Hotel staff was very friendly.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was very satisfied with our stay, the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and well laid out. The hotel was at a great location and the sites of Old Town were within walking distance. Will stay there again on our next visit to Alexandria. ."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I had stayed in 6 hotels over 4 weeks, and this was the best. Not only clean and comfortable, but great water pressure in the shower."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The trolley runs throughout the day and can take you to metro station. Jump on the metro and you're in D.C within 30 minutes! Loved the hotel!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was just a gorgeous hotel! The location on King Street was perfect. Very comfortable room and luxurious bathroom. Probably the nicest Hotel I have been to in the DC area. Recommended to couples as well as families. Will certainly stay here again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I love the Monaco, and the location.  I have been staying at that location since 1980 because I love Old Town.  Please keep up the good work so when I am back in VA it will always be as comfortable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco is located on Kings Street, the Main Street in Old Town Alexandria. Walk along King Street to wonderful shops and restaurants.  A short walk to the waterfront. If you drive into town the hotel has underground parking which wonderful because parking downtown can be difficult."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The things that made this a true 4 star: Service was great & the hotel looked pretty. Things that made this more like a 2 star: Cleanliness regardless of how many times I complained was very poor (we found a glass under the bed and it looked like it was there for months); they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc.; and the bed gave me the worst back pain ever!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel, and very friendly staff. Complimentary Wine happy hour was nice, as was life guard at pool. Room was a little tight for 4 of us, but it was as big as most hotel rooms would be, nothing more. Shuttle to DCA airport was nice, trolley to Metro was convenient. Unfortunately, trolley doesn't start until 11:30 pm and there is no shuttle to the Metro so we walked a lot more than we expected we would. Overall, we would stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I chose the Hotel Monaco because I've had such wonderful experiences with them in other cities. Moreover, the Expedia rate included transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. I called before embarqing from the west coast to ensure I could be picked up when my flight landed at 10:06 p.m. ""Oh, yes. Just call us."" The reality was that I was advised the ""last shuttle"" had come and gone and to take a cab. The hotel staff offered a prefuntory ""sorry"" and did nothing else. This was a promise that was not delivered and left me feeling less than happy. DJ"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We reserved at the Hotel Monaco( Kimpton) and stayed at a Marriott.(They changed owners the day before we arrived!!)  Big Difference!  We were not advised in advance!!  There was no coffee pot in the room!  No robes! and No Fish!  and No goodies at breakfast buffet!  Just coffee.  No break on the price even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees.  Oh sorry we got cookies and milk!Will not stay again!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","King street ,located near restaurants and shops, Wine reception with good wine, pleasant and helpful staff."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",beautiful and great location
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very Clean room. Great central location. You can pretty much walk to everything. Helpful and friendly staff !It would've been great if they provide you microwave and refrigerator also.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very convenient to downtown Alexandria.  Right in the middle of everything with relatively easy access to highwaysto travel around DC.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room smelled heavily of some strong chemical. Had to have it sprayed to minimize the odor. Lobby had some smell too. Dogs barking the first night and kids shouting and playing at 3am second night made sleeping impossible. Hotel is very convenient to Old Town and decorations are nice but I won't go back.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed over the past 3 day Easter weekend. Old Town Alexandria is a great area; nice restaurants, shopping atmosphere. Hotel was nice. Rooms were comfortable. Only problem was that the wet bar was locked every night when we came back. Both nights I called to have them unlock; the first night it took over 1 hour, the 2nd night almost 35 minutes. Other than that, pleasant stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My best friend and I went to Alexandria and stayed at the Hotel Monaco. It was a perfect stay, with a perfect room and perfect staff. We didn't want to leave. A huge thank you to Sam and Andrew for exceptional service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great room, great place. Room service order was wrong twice, clear communication, order repeated back correctly. Hard to figure...."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very cool!!! Clean and modern.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is very clean and in a great location.  There are a ton of shops and restaurants on King Street and the metro stop is about a mile away for easy quick travel into DC.  I would definitely stay here again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is convenient and short walk to the tourist area of Alexandria. About 12 blocks from Metro into DC. Bellhop/Valet do not speak english and are inconsistent at providing service. Front desk staff - one was pleasant the other was condescending. Got charged for a night we didn't use along with the parking - am still trying to argue it out with the management. Front desk clerk blamed Expedia.Would not stay here again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","stayed there for a quick weekend trip, recommended by a local of alexandria, and she was right, monaco was a great place to stay at. well decorated, clean room and well insulated. best part is location, $15 taxi from airport to hotel, walking distance to waterfront and king st is a riot itself. absolutely lovely.the only thing i'd hope they improve on is the noisy AC. it gives heart attacks when it kicks in."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was very impressed with the little attention to details here. Wow. Awesome stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great staff and have stayed here many times.  Room I was in was starting to look a little ""worn"".  Chips on door to bath, faded wallpaper and tears in vinyl headboard."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We love this hotel and stay there every time we are in Alexandria. It is in the middle of shops, restaurants, historical venues, etc."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco is a Boutique Hotel.  The attendants were especially helpful and the checkin was fine.  The room was clean, the bed comfortable and came with a flat screen HDTV.  We were there for a wedding and the reception was held in the Hotels facilities.  A courtyard was utilized for appetizers and drinks before the reception.  Service was excellent, the appetizers were tasty and readily available.  The reception meal was very well done, food excellent and service very good.  A breakfast was held in the morning and it was a disaster.  The service was terrible, items ordered never delivered.  Waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first I got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  We waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  The manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.  With 10 years of experience in Hotel dining rooms and myself serving 12 tables for 3 meals every day as well as being the head waiter; I cannot imagine why everything else was so great and this meal such a disaster."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location and love the art deco atmosphere.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco is very close to our favorite pub, Murphy""s. The location is so convenient to the pub and other restaurants and shop we enjoy. We definitely will stay again and probably bring our cat along the next time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel overall was great, but just after 10PM I could smell a strong odor of weed (I cant use the actual name of the drug that was buring, since it appears that the comment program does not allow the word to be used, I guess the truth is not acceptable) coming from the hallway.  I went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  I reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  I had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.  Other then this incident, it is a beautiful hotel in a prime location.  I just expected to actually enjoy my room for the money that I spent."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Love the new morning coffe 7 evening wine served in the lobby.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were leaving early for a trip and the airport shuttle was quick and easy.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We recently celebrated our anniversary at this beautiful property in Old Town Alexandria, VA. Upon arrival there was a card with berries and chocolate from the management. The room was amazing with a full tub with jacuzzi. The only problem is that the hotel is currently experiencing some electrical problems and is being powered by a generator. If you book a room this summer you might want to request a room away from that side of the hotel since it does create noise and fumes. The hotel was very responsive to our concerns and we look forward to returning to this property once their electrical issues have been resolved."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was fine!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I loved the room and the atmosphere was modern and chic very city like that a total oasis
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was great! Could use another mirror of some sort in the general area of the bedroom there's a long mirror in the hall but it's not very useful. Decor is interesting but much too busy in the hallways in particular. Priced well, good area, and easy access. Would stay here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I've stayed on two different occasions in the past couple of years. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the wine social in the evenings. Best location in Old Town!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very upscale hotel right in the heart of everything. A beautiful mix of patterns and colors throughout the hotel. Expansive rooms, ours had a balcony. Staff was warm and Jackson 20 restaurant was wonderful for Sunday brunch. Definitely staying here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful, well decorated and clean hotel. Loved it! Terrible rattling AC in the room that could use maintenance but the bathroom, bed and everything in the room was perfect besides that."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very pet-friendly hotel, the rooms are extremely new and clean, the bed was very comfortable, flat screen T.V., excellent location in Old Town.  We have stayed there twice now and the staff was very nice and helpful both times.  Valet parking made life very easy."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice location. Rooms were beautiful. Bathroom door had no lock (FYI) intentionally.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a wonderful stay. The stay were very friendly and helpful, the room was clean and very comfortable, and the location is great."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a fantastic stay here and a great time. A few slight mishaps: fire alarm went off one morning and we were left outside for about an hour, the minifridge in our room wasn't working and as of the end of our 4 nights still wasn't, and for 3 days the ice machine on our floor wasn't working. Its a little far out of DC (about 15-20mins on metro), but Alexandria was worth it. Overall, a wonderful time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","What a wonderful place to stay! A great hotel with character and excitement! An excellent location. And an incredible staff! Majid and BK are just a couple of the wonderful employees of Hotel Monaco. They made my stay relaxing, entertaining- and just fabulous!Looking forward to my next trip back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I remember this hotel when it was a Holiday Inn and it is so pretty now and the rooms are very comfortable. The best thing about the hotel is the location though, it's right on King Street the main street in Old Town and so central to everything and in walking distance of great restaurants and the river etc.. We had a lovely night there."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Friendly staff. Excellent wines. Delicious food. Only recommendation: water temperature too low.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Dette hotellet var helt vidunderlig. Alt var helt perfekt, deilig luksushotell Anbefales p�� det sterkeste"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice place to stay , but took us 2 different rooms to move from til we received what was acceptable to what was advertised. When we went to have the wonderful breakfast room service brought us, after a comfortable sleep, one of the chairs was unusable without a creative mind and the table slanted so steep that our coffee spilt. Not a big deal really.Overall, after a few digs, I would return there again to say hi to the friendly staff. Great location to stay for a Nationals game."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",very nice and friendly staff.  the dogs were not a distraction.  great festive atmosphere for Christmas.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Only stayed one night, but wish I had more time to stay there. It was very close to everything Old Town has to offer. Very comfortable rooms."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved the room. The bed was very comfortable. Both the room and the bathroom were generous in size. The location was perfect for our planned sight seeing trip. We both noticed that there were no intrusive noises coming from either the hall or the neighboring rooms. Our only issue was with the shower. We booked a room with a ""roll in shower"" because that was what was available, but the construction of the shower floor and the length of the shower curtain allowed us to ""flood"" the bathroom. Fortunately there was a drain in the bathroom floor and with all the available towels we were able to contain and direct the mess."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel, close to restaurants & waterfront. Expensive minibar!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I am a daily swimmer, and I loved the pool! The wine reception each late afternoon was an added touch. All personnel were exceptionally courteous and helpful, especially the doormen. They also provided complimentary shuttle to Reagan Airport and Amtrak station, which was a nice added touch."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",food was a little priceyStaff was pleasant although I question the need for a credit card # when I had already prepaid my room
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",superb all the way!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I didn't get either a queen bed or free wifi without arguing a lot with the desk staff - and showing my reservation confirmation.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Quite a change from the old Holiday Inn which occupied the building originally. Best location and very trendy. Cordless phone had been mangled and was beeping bec. battery was gone. We unplugged and hotel engineer just plugged it back in. Problem was note fixed. No shower cap in bathroom, would have to request it. Very busy. Nice happy hour."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Called multiple times for roomservice no answer. Called for an iPad charger and a hair brush; was told no charger and hair brush only a comb i available.  Meanwhile the sign in the room says if we don't have it, we'll go get it.  The turndown service ppl were rude giving dirty looks when asked for towels especially the men"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I wa really happy with the stay. We went up for a Redskins game. Hotel conveniently located in Old Town near Murphy's pub. Staff was excellent; the room was well appointed - even had night clothes you could buy in the closet. I left behind a nice leather coat w/ sentimental value. called a few days later. they had found it and shipped it via Fed Ex. I asked to pay for the shipping and they insisted on covering the cost. A nice touch in my opinion. I have no reservations referring this hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent staff! Very kind and helpful, the place has the aura of home somehow--small but useful touches, such as cold lemonade, great coffee and tea, apples... makes it like home.  Clean rooms, and cleaning staff are careful not to get in your way. Location in Alexandria is excellent, with a pharmacy close by, and transport links too. I will be returning, and by then I hope the Metro is fixed so access to DC is better given the traffic jams of the city."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel was in a perfect location for wandering around historic Alexandria. It was very clean and well-appointed. It was the nicest Kimpton hotel I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend it.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was disappointed with my stay at this hotel. My room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. The bed was too soft for my liking. Asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping. Staff was not receptive in finding my sandals. Disappointed
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",価格の割にはいろいろがっかりするホテルである。犬が自由に連れてこれるため常にロビーやエレベーターの中に犬がいる。＝匂いがある。　廊下も部屋もカーペットであるので匂いや汚れが気になる。スタッフはフレンドリーであるがそれ以上のものはない。場所はいいと思う。駅からは遠いが無料のトローリーバスがあるので便利。
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The food was great especially the B.E.L.T breakfast sandwich; good coffee, too, not that weak as water stuff hotels usually serve. Kings Street location has many shopping and food options. A great location with access to DC via the metro.I look forward to my next trip."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great hotel, very convenient for meeting and for access into city"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel right on King Street. Location could not have been better. Furnishings in the room and lobby were very nice. Staff were polite and helpful. Only complaint was the parking was a bit pricey. I would suggest parking in another ramp if you don't mind walking a few blocks.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Love the hotel Monaco!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location for Old Town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Delightful place - great style, very friendly service, and the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in in many a moon."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Alexandria is a wonderful place to stay and to have easy access to all the sites and attractions in Washington DC. The hotel is in the heart of the city but very quiet inside. Kimpton hotels are some of my favorites; I stay in them in many different cities around the country. Each one is uniquely decorated and has its own character, so it definitely does not feel like a chain. And yet they all conform to high standards of service, hospitality, and quality"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel is a real gem. The staff if fantastic and the other amenities make it a winner. Make sure to stop by the wine happy hour at 5:00 and visit with other guests. I also love that this hotel allows pets and that locals and guests with pets have happy hour in the courtyard on Tuesdays and Thursday. Old town is a great place to stay when visiting DC. This hotel is just a few blocks from the metro and you can take that in to see the DC sights and then return to adorable King Street in Alexandria for a great dinner and shopping.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My mom, sister & I stayed for a ""girls"" weekend. We had a blast! Such a unique hotel...VERY clean! Super memories made here!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great hotel, super location for business in Washington DC."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Helpful and friendly staff. I would stay there again. Only down side is the time it takes to walk (12 blocks) to the metro station and metro trip to get into DC.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I loved the stay at this hotel. It felt like a home away from home. T have two minor complaints; there is no privacy from the room and bathroom and The door greeters were a little slow so most of the time we opened the doors ourselves. That is not an issue for us not a big deal when we look at a hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our room wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet. We had to get our keys reprogrammed each day. The room doors slam shut and there isn't much noise proofing so that woke us up. The free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program. It is nicely decorated though.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything about this hotel is pretty positive except---the A/C in the room was terribly loud! Could not switch because they were booked!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Rooms and reception are OK (value for money), but the restaurant is substandard: staff negligent and careless. Choice and quality are sub optimal. Not value for money, and not what you would expect. Breakfast has been bad experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",…just fantastic on all fronts…like all Kimpton hotels
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful hotel in one of America's most historic areas. The staff is friendly and efficient. The setting is perfect for business or pleasure. Great walking area.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very comfortable and friendly hotel in the middle of old Alexandria. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is centrally located, and the room was spacious and beautifully furnished. The other facilities are tastefully decorated, but small, given the grandeur the hotel is trying to portray. There are amenities, but with nearly everything with this hotel, it comes at an additional cost (parking, wifi, etc). The staff is friendly, but lacking a professional demeanor, and information regarding services and benefits provided will only come if you know to ask (wine and breakfast). We looked forward for some time to staying here, and now that we have, it is unlikely that we'll repeat."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","A great place, and very dog friendly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Funky little place. Wine hour (that we didn't utilize). The soaps smelled great. The bed was comfortable, which is rare in the hotel industry. I'd go back. I though it was a little high priced, but then again, I'm accustomed to Vegas hotel prices."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Definitely, the best hotel in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staff was attentive and friendly, room was nice, absolutely no complaints"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always a treat to return to Hotel Monaco. Our recent overnight stay came during one of Alexandria's muggiest days. Stepping into the hotel lobby - the front door is almost always opened by a staff member- was a cool retreat from the oppressive heat. We missed the complimentary wine reception by 15 minutes so the hotel clerk gave us vouchers for drinks at the bar. Our third floor room fronted busy King St. but we experienced minimal street noise. Beautifully decorated room- lots of light. Great value for location and amenities
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Visiting DC on business. Can recommend this hotel and the area to women on their own. Wine reception is a nice touch. Chance to meet varied and interesting guests. Only complaint was slight lack of info on arrival and no help to room offered.Very friendly in attached restaurant. Basic room is a bit small but very comfy and bathroom facility is classy.I stayed in DC for five days but couldn't find a reasonably priced option for entirety of my stay. Which is why I ended up in Alexandria. Obviously not as convenient for DC but metro is quick, safe and cheap. Taxi was $25. Lots to see and do both historic and gourmet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel was really nice. Boutiquie but not off the wall. Nice restaurant with a cool bar. Oldtown Alexandria is a great area; there's a lot to do within walking distance.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel and surrounding area
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Had a wonderful stay at Hotel Monaco.  The staff makes this an extra special place to stay.  This hotel is pet friendly and I loved seeing all the beautiful dogs in the lobby.  10 minutes from national harbor Maryland and 20 from Washington DC.  Explored all areas including beautiful Alexandria itself.  Would stay again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a good hotel with excellent and friendly staff, and there are plenty of perks, such as an airport shuttle to Reagan National Airport, coffee in the AM, wine in the PM."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Terrific location in Old Town. Staff was always bright, friendly and efficient. Room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. Room service was prompt, food delivered hot."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Loved the location, the unique and comfortable room, the wine mix and mingle hour and the friendly staff."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Right in the middle of ole town Alexandria. n Street parking was not a problem. I try not to pay a hotel an extra $20/night when I'm already paying alot for the Hotel. My car can sleep on the street. The TV kept losing the picture and there was a slight plumming problem, but the attention was immediate. Very friendly service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Checked in had prepaid room; made to put $100 deposit a day deposit could not access funds Had made prior arrangements to use Bombay room woman came in and embarrassed us and wanted us to leave;   She then said we could stay if we took table clothes off table;  she refused to double check;   She found out she was wrong and never apologizedNo complimentary coffee in room.  Told we could not use restuarant unless reservationNo complimentary wifi yet it was listed as amentity on reservation
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room was clean, and the staff was great."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great stay
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel is in the center of Olde Town Alexandria with plenty to see and do all around it. The hotel has just been beautifully renovated and the rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds.  We ate in the restaraunt and found the food excellent and the service good and friendly.  The restaraunt is noisy however.  Wonderful luxery hotel that is also dog friendly.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Had two grandchildren first night, dined in Hotel Restaurant for dinner and breakfast with accommodation for children. Pool was nice amenity. Doormen were very responsive and check-in and out efficient and courteous."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Sehr gut renoviertes Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage Old Town Alexandria VAich kenne es noch von früher (damals in die Jahre gekommendes Holliday Inn) undhabe es fasst nicht wiedererkannt - so angenehm überrascht.Gutes Restaurant mit Barbereich
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our overnight stay was wonderful! Very relaxing in a beautiful hotel. We would love to visit again for a longer stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I am thoroughly impressed and deeply grateful to the staff at The Monaco. From my frantic phone call to announce my extremely late arrival, to loaning me a phone charger to replace the one I forgot. The front desk staff quickly calmed my concerns, and welcomed me with open arms upon arrival. The hotel is situated in a beautiful area that I spent hours exploring the next day. It is also a convenient, and inexpensive cab ride to all the fabulousness in D.C. Checking in and out was a complete breeze, and I was even given directions to a nearby garage which cost less than five buck for entire stay. My room was beautiful and cozier than home. I am a huge fan of Kimpton because hotels like The Monaco set a standard that other brands simply cannot meet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","super cute hotel, friendly and helpful staff, and really comfy room.alexandria could not have been a more relaxing little weekend getaway."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location and beautiful area.... we had an issue with a dog barking across the hall from us (it is a pet friendly hotel) that was not handled well.  Also, little things like the morning coffee being cold were not what you would expected from a ""nice"" hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Why write endless words when I can simply say the hotel accommodations are excellent!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great little find in the heart of Old Town! We found it online because they accept pets and was near the venue we were attending. Very pet friendly - awesome room and staff. We stayed by chance, but will make it a destination next time. And on Saturday mornings it is right across from a huge farmers market which we loved shopping at. We even found a fun little antique chest from the 1800's and of course great produce! Get there early though because they close the farmers market at 11am."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was in Virginia for training. Your hotel was fabulous! I felt very welcome and loved the area.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My family of three stayed at the Hotel Monaco during our sightseeing vacation to Washington DC. The room was magnificent with comfortable beds, a well stocked refrigerator and internet access. We did walk the 11 blocks to the King Street metro station the first day, but on the following 3 days we caught the DASH bus right across the street from the hotel. It cost us $1.25 each and the tickets were good for the whole day, so we could ride back to the hotel also. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Monaco again. The only complaint we have is that for the last 3 nights of our stay, they had no towels at the pool so we had to bring the handtowels from our room."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was a bit disappointed with the fitness center.  When i come to Alexandria I always like to stay at the Monaco b/c of the fitness center.  Its small, but has what i need.  But this time, there were weights missing.  There was no jump rope.  And the water cooler was empty.  Not good.  I may consider another hotel next time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","All I can say is: ELEGANT! The staff was professional, courteous, and helpful. Only criticism I have is that check-in is at 3 p.m. and I would have preferred an earlier check-in. Excellent exercise room and smallish but comfortable pool. Pricey, but well-worth it!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Enjoy all of our Kimpton stays. Lobby was lovely and service great. Perfect location in Alexandria! Free shuttle to and from DCA saved us cab fare! Definitely recommend!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel well situated in AlexandriaOur room was in the far top corner of the hotel therefore it took more than five minutes of running the hot water tap in order to receive tepid waterOther issue toilet ran very slow and was blocked had to call housekeeping a number of times to get this issue rectifiedIn future we will ensure we have a centrally located room
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room and staff were exceptional - except for the lobby area. I was there 2 days and both days the coffee service was out. The front desk staff insisted they were ""on it"" but after 15-20 minutes, still no coffee. The lobby was generally crowded in the mornings as well. Not enough seating for the number of people hanging around - probably waiting for their coffee as well. I like Kimpton properties but this one needs a bit of help from the management."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",空港への無料送迎シャトルもあり、朝のコーヒー、ハッピーアワーのワインがロビーでサーブされ、部屋も清潔快適、壁紙が様々なガス灯のイラスト、値段が安けりゃもっといいのですが。
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I am from the area so I knew of the hotel but had never stayed there so I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of service and the really fantastic decor inside each and every detail of the hotel. I knew it was well located to going out and about in Old Town Alexandria but there is also an airport shuttle and people were very helpful in getting more information about transportation to Washington etc. I got a great rate on Hotels.com so that made it more worth it. I would pay the regular prices if I was only going to be there for a few nights but if you can get the rate for better it really stands above the other local options like the Holiday or Comfort Inn. I was very impressed with the high quality.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Centrally located to everything you need. 5 years running have stayed here for the St. Patrick's day parade. Love this hotel!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very comfortable, friendly staff, excellent breakfast, convenient to the King Street boutique shops."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was wonderful. Except my room wasn't ready at check-in time. Had to wait about an hour. Other than that everything was wonderful
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Friendly, helpful staff. Near shopping and restaurants in old Alexandria, walking distance."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Enjoyed my stay here very much, the bed was very comfortable and bathroom amenities luxurious. Would stay here again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I had used Hotel.com points for a discounted room and had read somewhere online that when you book with points or free nights that hotels give you there worst room. I believe it now. My room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. There was a humming sound coming from outside that I didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. One set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. The next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. I found out during the night that my room had no heat. When I first checked in, I just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. I returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while I was sleeping. No such luck, at 3 am I woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. Since I didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, I bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. At 6:30, I gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. When I checked out, I told the clerk that they should check the heat since I had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. I was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.Thank god I had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers. And why no coffee in the rooms?"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel, comfortable room, friendly staff.  Great location right on King Street."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Ended up with a room where windows faced brick wall,so was disappointed with that. Otherwise stay was perfectly nice. Very dog friendly hotel and area, which was great for us."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I loved the location, gorgeous decor, complimentary coffee and tea in the morning, the pool (although I wish it wasn't shut down for four hours between 10-2), onsite parking with valet and in and out options and nearby restaurants.The check in was a bit rocky because the woman who checked me in took my name, disappeared for 10 minutes to tend to something else, while I thought she was tending to my check in.  She returned and asked me my name again and began the checkout process.  She offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which I learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.   The management should train its desk staff to be professional, courteous and to know the basic facts of the hotel's amenities."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at the Hotel Monaco this Saturday to attend a game at FedEx Field. This was our second time staying with the hotel and it was just as good as I remembered from two years ago. Unfortunately this stay much much shorter:(.We arrived just about when complementary wine hour began. Had just enough time to get to our room, freshen up and have a couple of glasses of vino. I enjoyed the merlot while my DH have the white (didn't notice what kind). The red was wonderful!Our room was nice and very clean. The only issue was the mini bar fridge wasn't working. After notifying the front desk, they sent someone right on it while we were out for dinner.Morning coffee is excellent, however I wish coffee was in the room for better convenience. Thank goodness I had someone willing to go downstairs and get some to bring back to the room.While staying, there were two weddings going on and lots of people dressed in suits and so on... I felt a little intimidated only because we weren't dressed to the nines. While sitting in wine hour, the lobby got very crowded and loud with the wedding parties but we were able to score a spot, find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching.All in all, this place is great! The location can't be beat and it's not too pretentious."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I really loved this hotel.  There were wine tastings every night from 5pm-6pm.  The decorations were incredible, the rooms were nice, sized just right for business.  There were two robes wonderfully hanging in the closet and a flat screen tv with a great picture.  I looked forward to going back to the room after a day of meetings."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Prior to staying at this hotel, I stayed in the Monaco in Portland and expected a similar level of service and excellence of the room. The walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room kept me up all night snoring. The air-conditioning system is ancient and stopped working in the middle of the night. Before it stopped altogether the hotel engineer came in and said that it needed replacing. It took 2 calls to get room service to call me back after they said they would call in a minute (I waited 30 mins). The menu was hit and miss with changes and deletions and snotty attitude about special requests. It seemed a rather amateur operation overall and I won't return."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Close to sites, restaurants...hotel is lovely ..rooms,fridge well equipped! Pet friendly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel!  We have stayed hear every year for New Years. Perfect place to enjoy all Akexandria has to offer.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very friendly and helpful staff.Very comfortable room.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was great! I think that the location is great and right in the middle of Old Town. The hotel was great and service was excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great room ready to relax.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel was great! The service was great and the prices were good as well. It was my wife and I one year anniversary and they made it so special. Great location and great people.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","WE HAD A GREAT STAY AT THE HOTEL MONACO.  WE WERE THERE FOR 6 NIGHTS. THE LOCATION WAS PERFECT. THE STAFF WERE HELPFUL.  THE STANDARD KING ROOM WAS SPACIOUS.  WE HAD A STREET VIEW OF KING STREET, WHICH WAS GREAT.  THE RESTAURANT AND BAR HAD EXCELLENT SERVICE.  WE TRAVELED INTO DC 3 DAYS AND HAD 2 DAYS OF DAY TRIPS.  WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO MT VERNON AND TRAVELED TO ANAPOLIS AND BALTIMORE THE OTHER DAY.  WE USED THE METRO TO GET IN AND AROUND DC.  THE HOTEL WAS WELCOMING TO KIDS AND PETS, WHICH WAS A PLUS FOR MANY PEOPLE.  OVERALL, I WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is lovely and the door men are very friendly! I cannot say the same for the staff at the front desk. They make it obvious that they really don't care that much about the guests
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Book it now! A perfect hotel. Walk to shops and Dinner. Enjoy you visit to old town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco is a great hotel. I have stayed there many times, and without problem, however this trip I had extremely limited hot water at both the sink and the shower. This was the case both at check in and the next morning. For this reason I can""t give them a top rating this time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Love Old Town!  So much activity and great restaurants.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, nice amenities, friendly and efficient staff"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Hotel Monaco was very comfortable and within easy walking distance of restaurants and sightseeing.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was excellent - the rooms are large and clean and the staff was very accomidating. The hotel bar could probably use an upgrade - but it works.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Shame the pool was closed at a time it was advertised as open.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We booked online without knowing the location. We couldn't have picked a better/friendly place if we had been there in person making a choice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","not aware of Expedia VIP perks, shower was luke warm at the most, restaurant mediocre.Just not my place. Always love Kimptons, just not this one."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Overall nice hotel. Staff could use improvement. Prices are on the high side. Underground parking garage is convenient for Old Town, Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staff was very friendly- from the doormen, to the front desk to housekeeping. Great location- wouldn't stay anywhere else when I come to Old Town again. Located right in the heart of it all. Rooms were beautiful, had no complaints."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The bathroom was nice and large with a good shower. The toilet was not close to the bed as some other hotels tend to be (pet peeve of mine). For the price, I would expect a larger living space but it was spacious enough."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This trip was my mother's first to our Nation's capital. Staying in Alexandria, at the Hotel Monaco, was the highlight of our trip. It was so luxurious and comfortable that she did not want to leave. After a day of sight seeing we ended up picking up dinner 2 of the 3 nights that we were there and ate in the room! It was lovely."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was spotless and the staff warm and inviting. Every effort was made to insure our comfort. Parking was reasonable as well.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel is weiil located on King .St. where a free trolley operates most of the day. Very good restaurants, especially Le Madeleine, close by and the waterfront is within easy walking distance. Trolley run to the King St. Metro which connects to the DC and surrounding area. There is a courtesy van that will pickup and take you to the Reagan Airport (DCA) which was not advertised. Use it. We will stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice upscale hotel right in the heart of Old Town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a great time here. Staff was very courteous and helpful.  It's a fun yet chic atmosphere; they serve wine from 5 to 6 every evening in the lobby.  The metro is about a mile on King Street, an easy walk, and then visited the sites of Washington from there.  The only annoyance was that the room key card lost its charge several times, so that needed recharging or a new key card.  The staff was cheerful dealing with that issue, however.  Highly recommend, especially if you get a good price, like I did, on Expedia.  $110 a night."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location with lots of shopping/restaurants in walking distance. Easy to get to the Metro train station to go anywhere else.Was disappointed as I don't think The Monaco was up to the same standard as other Kimpton properties. The walls are very thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room. Housekeeping failed to refresh toiletries, requiring a call at 4 am to get shampoo. Won't be returning to this one unfortunately."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was very nice but the room [...] were not happy about the parking our only option was valet, there was no street parking unless you drove around searching and then u have to pay for the meter anyway.  [...]  Overall the hotel was nice but the bed was not what we were excpecting."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Cet h��tel est tr��s tr��s bien.Parfaitement bien situ�� dans Alexandria Old Town: tout le charme �� c��t�� de Washington sans ses inconv��nients.Le m��tro est accessible avec un tramway gratuit (10mn) et DC �� 15/20mn; et il y a en plus une navette Apt.On ne regretterait m��me pas Georgetown car les commerces sont plus dynamiques, les maisons ravissantes, les restaurants bons et tr��s accessibles, et les bords du Potomac qui finalisent la touche romantique : un must!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was so classy, stylish, and fun to stay at. The had free coffee in the lobby, which is a beautiful place to sit and plan your day. The room was also so well decorated and plush, with a big desk. The pool is indoors and it's like a greenhouse in there. The pool is also very small. The metro is a good mile walk, but everything else is right there including a nice French bistro we ate breakfast at every day, and a short 5 or 6 minutes to the water. I wish they had more Kimpton hotels-- I would definitely stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",As a native Alexanrian I wanted to return to my home town and experience the best time possible to see my city as I did not see it when I lived there. The Hotel Monaco and the Old Towne area was the best choice to make my return home more than memorable.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved the hotel. Very comfortable. Right in the Heart of Old Town with all its great restaurants and shops. We loved the wine from 5-6pm everyday in the lobby. Very classy.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Stayed for a high school rivalry football game and enjoyed the hotel location and the bar Jackson 20
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","- Check-in was 1.5 hours after 3 p.m. listed time because rooms were not cleaned.- Front desk had me down for king bed, when I had specifically requested two doubles. That was fixed.- Front desk promised to call cell when room was ready; never did. Had to"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Helpful staff, wine reception each night, Nice design in hotel and rooms. Very central to old town you can walk everywhere. parking a bit steep, you can park cheaper in nearby garages. Nice lobby to sit and meet in. I would recommend."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","In the midst of a heat wave, the air con system was either blasting cold air or very hot air. Otherwise, the hotel was excellent and service above par."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, great room, great service! Close to dc with a beautiful drive to the city. Lots of neat shops and a block away from Starbucks. Would love to stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room was nice but i Paid thru your website abd then they charged me for my room also . Double check before you check out
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location. Amazing staff. Room was nicely decorated. Bed could have been a little firmer but that's subjective. (As with most cities, you can find cheaper parking around the corner.) I choose Kimpton every time given the opportunity. The rooms are consistently spotless and charmingly decorated with friendly, helpful employees. We even got a little welcome kit for my travel partner, my dog. Did I mention, I love Kimpton?"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","first time staying in Alexandria, hotel location was perfect, only drawback was free trolley did not run early in the morning so the walk down to the metro was long"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great accomodations in the heart of old Town Alexandria. Whether your heading to the Capitol or looking to check out some local history The Hotel Momaco is in the heart of the action. Great service, spacious rooms and a special location in the heart of Old Towne."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We just had one night at this hotel, so we were very disappointed to find out the FREE airport shuttle didn't start until 7am.  We changed from another Kimpton property because of the shuttle.  We could've taken the metro if we stayed at the other Kimpton.  I just felt like it was a bit of false advertising by Expedia at the Hotel Monaco.  This was a $20 error, and the hotel couldn't do anything to make it right.  Is there anything Expedia is willing to do to earn our business in the future?  We will be travelling a lot to the East Coast now that our son is in school there.  Please let us know."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was great,very friendly! Get a suite with the Fuji soaking tub! The Girlfriend and I stayed here for a romantic get away. The suite with the Fuji soaking tub was a bit pricey but well worth it! Will def stay here again!! Walking distance to some good restaurants. If you can't park in the front of the hotel for valt, circle around to Pitt street for their garage entrance. tThere's another entrance to the hotel as well!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I booked three rooms for 7 cousins for our annual get-together.  We almost cancelled because of an impending hurricane but were so glad we braved the rain.  When we arrived we were given rooms on the 6th floor where there was a leak.  We requested and soon got rooms on the second floor.  We had a lovely time and really enjoyed the wine reception each day.  We used the restaurant for a lavish breakfasts and brunch.  The staff was super efficient and friendly and booked us restaurant reservations that I could not get on my own.  I have stayed at the Monaco several times before and because I always had a great time I recommended that we have our annual visit there.  No one was disappointed!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Exceptional location. Luxurious hotel, Near shops and restaurants, easy transport with free rides to Main Street and accessible to public transport. Tourist spots near the area. Guest service was exceptional. Hotel offered free use of gym and pool besides a beautiful place to go jogging outside."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was a beautiful weekend with beautiful Christmas decorations.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Our 2nd time at this hotel in the heart of historic Alexandria. Staff is welcoming and knowledgable and check-in was a breeze. The 5-6 pm happy hour in the lobby is clearly a big draw as it was packed with enthusiastic wine drinkers, several with their dogs who are welcomed at the hotel.Valet parking is available or you can self park in the underground garage which we did. However the validated ticket didn't work and we had to pay to get out. There is a $29 per day parking charge but the staff were quick to override the charge given our difficulty.Highly recommend this hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice change from the big chain hotels--I enjoy Hyatt and Starwood chain...but I decided to book at Kimpton hotel ---excellent staff and location.  Great service from the staff with free van service from the REagan Airport and Metro.  It is easy to get to the airport and on Metro into DC.  Highly recommended!!!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and were very pleased with the Hotel and staff and the location was perfect. We flew in and didn't rent a car so we walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was great. It's close to the Harbour, shopping and lots of restaurants and historic attractions. If you aren't into walking the free shuttle runs on King Street and is very easy to access. They have free pick up at the airport and also for your return. No in room coffee which I missed but coffee and teas available in the lobby every morning which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon. If we ever go back to Alexandria we wouldn't stay anywhere else."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Had two days of meetings in the immediate are and this hotel was located within walking distance to the meetings. Room was nice but hallway smelled like a wet dog...lots of rain in the region so could be understandable until I saw someone with a dog sitting in the lobby. I am not a pet owner but do understand that those who are sometimes forget about all the paying (nearly $300 a night) customers with pet allergies who have to stay in a hotel that apparently allows pets. Just need to keep a lower profile and keep them out of the public areas.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I booked a room with the understanding that the bathroom would have the tub that was pictured online. This was NOT the case at all. Tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool it was closed. The heater in the room was so loud turning on and off it woke me up throughout the night. I feel as if i was way over charged for what i got. I went there for a romantic get away and ended up walking away feeling like i could have gone somewhere else and got a better deal, with better service, and had the services i paid for but never recieved (such as the pool and the big bathroom i saw online)available to me."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We've been to Alexandria many times but have never stayed at the Hotel Monaco until this stay but will make it our first hotel choice - what a wonderful hotel with a great staff
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very simply put, PERFECT!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","super friendly and helpful staff! only complaint is about the wine reception. same wine each night, with one addition from time to time, and only snack was mixed nuts. also, was in the crowded, cold (December) lobby. would have been better held in one of the meeting rooms. if you don't care about a free glass of wine, this place is great! I do recommend it. the best location and service!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel located in the heart of Old Town Alexandria.  Great location for walking with many restaurants and bars a short walk away.  Hotel service has always been top notch, have stayed here several times for business trips.  Great for families, and close to metro to DC and DCA."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Perfect. Right in the heart of King Street, near shops, restaurants, walked from metro, to waterfront many, many times during stay. DC was not far by metro ride, staff at hotel very helpful. I have to say, the service and room contributed to the overall positive experience. When we came home we even went to buy new pillows because the ones in our room were so comfortable! The best sleep we had."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I booked for 2 nights, but decided to stay for another 4. Alexandria is a lovely place and the Monaco is in a great location in the Old Town, and close to the free trolley to King Street metro station, so you can also get into DC easily. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was stylish and comfortable. No tea/coffee maker, but they will provide one on request. I will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It took, receptionist almost an hour to allow me to check in. It appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity, apathy and unwillingness to take action. This tainted this hotel experience very unpleasant. This is not Hotels.com fault but with the Monaco Hotel reception staff.I had to contact Hotels.com inorder to persuade Hotel Monaco staff to provide me a room which I had already paid. it was late at night, it took far too long and was very frustrating."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Pretty hotel, good location, but not what I was expecting. Climate control fan was extremely noisy. Temperature was either very cold when fan not running or extremely hot when it was. The view was a brick wall!!The shower pressure was very weak and the shower head had one position- facing straight down, making it difficult to shower. Dissapointing!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I attended a conference in National Harbor, Md but my wife and I preferred to stay in Old Town because we love King St. and my wife could also use the metro from there for sightseeing.  We've stayed at other Kimpton Hotels and this one measured up with excellence all around.  Friendly staff, clean, and tastefully decorated.  Coffee and Hot Chocolate on the weekend were a hit.  La Madeleine next door to the hotel was a great breakfast spot.  We also enjoyed Chadwick's for dinner- a short walk down to the water."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location with excellent restaurant. Beds are quite firm.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From its eclectic décor to its impeccable service, the Monaco offers a fantastic getaway in the heart of old town Alexandria. I stayed for a Birthday weekend & had a wonderful time. The bedding was incredibly comfortable, the amenities were well appointed, & the service was excellent. I highly recommend the Monaco."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Despite being given a one-hour extended check-out time of 1:00 pm, housekeeping began showing up at 10:00 am in an effort to have me vacate my room. After their fifth visit, and many explanations about how the front desk authorized my late check-out, I left at 11:15 am (45 minutes before actual check-out time). I was unable to complete my work for my meetings, and left shaken and annoyed. The desk clerk seemed uninterested in my situation. What started out as a pleasurable experience, ended very differently."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was my second time to stay at the Hotel Monaco.  It is in an ideal location.  very easy to get to and from Reagan airport via the free shuttle offered by the hotel.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Location in the heart of Old Town is ideal.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco with our 18 month son. We had a great experience. The whole staff was wonderful from the shuttle driver to the desk staff. We had the shuttle pick us up from the airport and they were pretty prompt. The staff had a crib set up in our room within 10 minutes of our arrival. Everyone was extremely friendly to our son which I was grateful for. We did experience the warm temperatures in the hallway but the lobby temperature was pleasent. On the 3rd night of our stay our AC broke in our room (and there was a loud party in the room next to ours). We called the front desk and they switched rooms for us pretty quickly. They even gave my son some toys to play with while we packed and did the swap. The location is amazing. Great restaurants around and plently of places to walk to. The hotel is not within comfortable walking distance to the metro but there is a free trolley that runs from the waterfront to the metro every 15 minutes. The trolley picks up a block from the hotel and runs from 10 to 10. Overall we had a great stay!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Our stay at this hotel was positive all round and if we visited DC in the future we'd be happy to return to the Hotel Monaco.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Usually I love Kimpton hotels, and even this one, but this time not so much. I was fragrance - bombed on 2nd floor. New room had iron that spit soot. I asked for an ionizer, and got a humidifier."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel was intimately nestled in the heart of Old Town. There was access to shops and restaurants all within walking distance. The hotel had a warm ""old town"" feel along with an eclectic atmosphere. The staff was ready and willing to help with whatever we needed. Our room had robes and a chaise by the window that I thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in. I would highly recommend this hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My family enjoyed our stay - great location in the heart of Old Town.Only complaint was the $14.99 per day for wifi.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We got off to a rough start when we were given incorrect directions to the hotel's parking facilities...twice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We return to this hotel now every year; great vibe, lobby area is always filled with friendly people, kids, dogs, and complimentary coffee/tea or wine in afternoon.  Location can't be beat; near great restaurants and walking; across street from a Saturday farmer's market which is terrific."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful hotel in a great location. The eclectic and stylish Kimpton decor is a treat, both in the room and in public areas. Immaculately clean. Attentive staff.Location is unexpectedly fantastic. King street Alexandria can be toured on foot end to end, full of boutiques and restaurants. Alexandria has historic homes and the riverfront parks, plus the running/cycle path from DC to Mount Vernon runs right through it.Also worth noting is you are in DC in 15 mins by car, or you can take the free shuttle down king street to the metro.The only minor complain is a noisy AC in the room, and thats nitpicking really."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I only stayed there a night, but found everything to be very comfortable. I am not completely sold on the ""discovering your wild side"" theme. I prefer white robes over robes with animal prints. But after I got over the animal print, I found the robe very comforatable. I enjoyed my moring walk to the USPTO down King Street, which took me about 15 (fast NY walking) minutes."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Whether you're on vacation or just having a quiet night in the city the Monaco is by far the best choice. We were greeted immediately by the valet and escorted to the front desk and even introduced to the entire staff working the front desk! The staff on hand is second to none and well worth the price of a night or even a week's stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent hotel would go back!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Just stayed one night, but was very impressed. Literally nothing bad to say. The perfect little boutique hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel in heart of Olde Town. Easy walking to great food, shops and water taxi's. The indoor pool has short hours."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Comfy room, nice price, in the center of everything. Overnight parking $24...a bit steep, but service was impeccable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great clean nicely designed rooms. Parking is not included!! $27/night
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I always enjoy staying at Hotel Monaco at Alexandria. Staff never fail to greet you at the door or at the hall way. It's very accessible as it is located at King's st. where you can just walk out the door, get coffee, or grab something to eat. The beds are very comfortable and clean. Bathroom is very clean! The only thing that kind of got in my nerves is parking. They do not offer free parking! As far as I remember, you will have to pay 10 dollars a day for internet access."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From the moment we entered the doors, it was a terrific experience. The decor is very warm and eclectic. Not at all like the typical sterile hotel lobby. The fire was burning in the fireplace and the furniture is bright and modern and warm all at the same time. The valet service was perfect; they remembered us and my car was outside without a wait, even though the hotel was totally booked. I mentioned that we were celebrating my mother's birthday when we checked in. When we returned from an outing there was a bottle of wine and a chocolate dessert waiting for us. It was the most personal experience I have had in a long time and I travel extensively. The location is perfect for eating, shopping and access to the metro, if you are interested in touring DC."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","there was a wedding reception right under our room that was extremely loud.  Many other guests complained, and lasted into the evening.  Housekeeping was a joke.  They didn't vacuum or pick up trash or towels in the room; bathroom cleaning was minimal.  They also knocked on the door and opened it even though the ""do not disturb"" notice was hanging on the door."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was in town for business and this was the first time I stayed here.  The woman as the desk was very professional and personal. The room was bigger than expected and comfortable. Next time I'm in town, I will be trying to stay here."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We really enjoyed this two night getaway. We loved the comfort and location. Terrific restaurants and shopping.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful hotel in a great location , heart of old town . Friendly helpful staff , very comfy rooms .. Would Definately stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is our second time staying at this hotel, and plan to do so again. This is a lovely hotel, fun without being ""over the top"". Service is excellent, location can't be beat. Rooms are spacious, very comfortable, love the bathrooms too!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location. Staff friendly and helpful. Lovely wine hour every evening.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We knew nothing about this hotel but what a find it is! The location is in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, beautifully decorated, friendly and helpful staff, a bustling bar, and just a really happy place to be. From now on, when we are in Alexandria we will stay nowhere other than The Monaco."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved it. Will go back everytime Im in town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Terrible place to drive to. No on-street or close parking. Front desk gal couldn't find my reservation, but luckily the manager or whoever was close by and he was able to find it. Bathroom faucet handle loose and wobbling all over. I should have read more about room. No in-room coffee pot and shuttle to airport didn't start until 7 a.m., causing me to have to take an additional cab. Not some place I would stay again, but ok. I give it a 3,"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great one night stay. Staff was very friendly and the hotel was very nice. Highly recommend .
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a high quality hotel, comfortable, clean with great rooms and sometimes surprising details (leopard skin bath robes!) that make it worth coming back to. Add to that the location in cute old Alexandria and the fact that DC proper is within easy reach as are some great walks down the river and you've got a winner."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The room wasn't cheap, by was more than I expected. It was incredibley easy to come in for Reagan International, as long as its not during rush hour. I would recommend the hotel and plan to stay there on my next trip to Northern Virginia.Additionally, the restaurant, Jackson 20, was great!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","One night, good price and good room.  Except for the non view it was just fine."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We were in town for a wedding and wanted to spend some extra time in the area to do some sightseeing around the Capitol. This hotel was perfect, close to all kinds of dining options, many little shops to browse through, walking distance to the river and a free Trolley car to get easily to the Metro station. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. I would go back and stay here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I had a great time. The room was beautiful and the staff was courteous and attentive.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is old and well kept. I arrived in a snowstorm and was idle (business trip) on my second day due to snow.The staff is wonderful from the valets to the housekeepers!! Talk to them all and engage them and they will all brighten your day.If you wish the hotel will send a Goldfish to your room!! For children or you to enjoy if you want a pet!It is NOT the newest Hotel in the area but definitely the best. The parking garage is great and I did not have to drive the entire week I was there.Stay here and enjoy yourself,"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel provides great service. Very clean and staff friendly. We have stayed in the Kimpton hotels before and really like them.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice decorated rooms , very freindly staff stayed there already 3 times and will always go back there"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Right in the heart of Historic Alexandria and just a quick walk to the King Street Metro Station. We were in town to do site seeing of the Washington, DC area and found this hotel to be very comfortable and welcoming after a long day of site seeing. There are several wonderful restaurants to choose from within one block of this hotel, so many that it is sometimes hard to pick one. The people of Alexandria seem to be quite fond of their dogs as witnessed by the bowls of fresh water put out on the sidewalk by many of the shop owners and even this hotel. The Hotel Monaco is a ""Dog Friendly"" establishment and allows you to bring Fido with on your stay. I must say that when I spotted a hotel guest with her dog in the lobby while we were checking in I got just a little nervous of what we would find when we got to our room; we were very pleased the cleanliness and decor were both wonderful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I love Alexandria and this hotel really stands out.  They have exceptional service, from the doorman who is extremely friendly to the room service personnel.  Everyone is friendly and nice.  We went as a family and I felt it catered to all types.  There was also a convention going on but you wouldn't even know it from how quiet it was.  They have a shuttle service to the Metro which was very convenient, as well as the metro to Reagan Airport.  We would definitely stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice visit. Close to everything. Eclectic decor but clean and comfortable.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent quality hotel (at a great price!) - beds were comfortable, service was great, and the location right on King Street a couple blocks from the harbor."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hôtel très bien situé, proche du Potomac et sur la rue commerçante King. Accueil très sympatique. Cet hôtel est dog friendly, et bien que nous n'ayions pas de chien, cela ne nous a nullement gêné. À recommander."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful town encompasses this hotel. The service is top notch with every staff member smiling constantly. The kids loved the pool and our room.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is a great base for Old Town Alexandria. A bit of a hike to the metro(and DC access without a car), but not too far (10min walk or so). The hotel is clean, comfortable, and the price-quality ratio is exceptional. Easy access to many restaurants and cafes and the Alexandria waterfront. I would definitely stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I stayed in room 645, it took a very long time for shower to reach usable temperature. the sink water never warmed up enough to use. the refrigerator in the mini bar produced a high pitched humming sound so loud we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug. we needed to iron our clothes before dinner and thought the iron was broke but it was the wall plug that didn't work. we enjoy you hotel and a night out in town but didn't expect to be room inspector we assumed you guys policed yourselves."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice hotel, friendly, wine hour daily, coffee in the lobby each morning, great room (400 sq ft), newly decorated & updated... My problem is the hotel allows dogs... and consequently smells of dog in the elevator, lobby, halls... and you encounter dogs regularly... Your choice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Place had too many animals and I'm allergic to pets...although I did receive a pet free room, there were pets every where in the lobby and elevators. I don't have anything against pets, but I am highly allergic therefore, people with allergies should be considered."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room was large and comfortable. The service was really friendly. We had a great time.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Hotel Monaco is all about details. They do everything well. This hotel is nestled in the perfect spot in Old Town between shops and the waterfront. Every member of the staff was there to help out and did so beautifully. I can't wait to try other Hotel Monaco location and go back to this one.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco Alexandria was a great experience, its location was near anything one could ask for,less than twenty minutes from Washington DC. The hotel amenities was great. Parking was limited but you can use the Valet parking for $20.00 a day."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent Location!!!!  Only about 10 blocks from the Metro station and 4 blocks from riverfront, property surrounded by quaint little shops. Staff was helpful and friendly.  Only complaints are cold water on third day of stay and food at Jackson 20 (adjoining restaurant) was bad and high priced."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel Monaco is well worth a visit friendly staff. &very helpful too make sure u ask for a King street. View and the third floor is a dog free zone So request this floor if u r not traveling with a pet. Great wine reception each nite in lobby and a wonderful restaurant adjacent for brunch or a casual meal. Location can't be beat spacious rooms enjoy we did !!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was very impressed with the hotel, staff was very helpful. The King St. trolly goes right by the hotel every 15 min. and is free to ride, will take to to the water front or the Metro with several stops on the way. There were a lot of dogs in the motel but if I had not seen the dogs I would not have known they were there. Very quite and did not have a ""dog"" smell. The restaurant next to the hotel was a bit pricey but the waiter and waitress were very helpful with area information"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Would not stay there again. No parking - forced to use valet - had to pay for internet use.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was 'plus-que-parfait'!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Superb location, good rooms and amenities. Not perfect, but a very above average hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Bel hôtel bien décoré aux chambres spacieuses. Bon accueil comme dans tous les hôtels du groupe Kimpton.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was amazing!!!!  The hallway on the 6th floor had a very musty bad odor, not a good first impression.  The room had an equally musty odor... ick!  I turned the A/C off when I left and came back to a freezing room.  Maint came up and changed the batteries on the controller.  I like the $10 spiff for being a Karma member:)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Easy check in and out.  There was to be a Friday night happy hour but I could not find it.  Housekeeping  came late one day and I was trying to get ready to go out, didn't need them then.  The room was comfortable and quiet, got good sleep.  Loved having a door man when I came in with my arms full."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Et greit opphold, store rom. Bra sv��mmebasseng. Rent. Bra lokalisert i Gamle byen."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fantastic stay. Great/.safe area with lots of restaurants and antique shops (if you're into that sort of thing)... hotel is a 15 min walk from the metro. Staff are very helpful and the restaurant next door a good choice for breakfast. There are adequate gym facitlities for a hotel and a decent pool. Staff are able to give you good and easy to follow routes for running. There isn't really anything bad to say about this hotel except that it is quite far away from Dulles. Worth the journey though and would definitely stay there again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Manaco is always lovely, but it's starting to show some wear and tear. I stayed one night. The room was very nice and clean, but there was big scratches on the headboard. The showerhead is dated and not great shower pressure. When I pulled the lever on the spout to transfer the water to the shower head, I could pull the entire spout from the wall; and the toilet ran every 30 minutes and woke me up many times at night. I informed the hotel during my check-out, so it could be rectified for the next guest. I stayed one night, last year at this time, and remember having similar ""small"" issues with my room. I think for $325 for one night, I will try another hotel next year."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I stayed at Hotel Monaco to celebrate out wedding anniversary and it was one of the worst hotel experience we have had. Do not let the decor fool you. Our first room on the 4th floor was like having your bedroom set in a dog kennel, with dog owners leaving their pets unattended in their room while they were dinning and going out. Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. There usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. This is not a boutique hotel, not even close. More like a bad Holiday Inn."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We spent 6 nights in mid july and had a second floor room. Very clean, quiet and extremely comfortable room. King size bed was very comfortable, large flat screen TV was great,mini bar a plus. Double swinging bathroom doors were not ideal in front of vanity sink for in and out movement. Grab rails needed in bath/shower area. Hotel staff extremely aware of customers daily needs and very courteous to us at all times. Pool hours strange 5pm-10pm only no day time use? Would definitely recommend staying here and we will be back again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Friendly staff and comfortable room
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful location next to the civil court. Many convenient stores nearby. From Starbucks to Walgreens and the like and many restaurants from breakfast bistros to sit down dinners. Enjoyed the time spent there.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Within walking distance to restaurants, bars & King Street Metro.Wine reception nice and lobby fireplace great!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We spent four nights in this hotel whilst touring Virginia. First impression was that we didn`t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding! Check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable room. Our booking said we had free Wi-Fi but this turned out not to be the case. We soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog! This is the reason I would not recommend this hotel to some of my friends as they are not dog lovers and would simply have left. Everything else about the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as the Kimpton we stayed in in Philadelphia.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved the coziness of this hotel and the location. It has a CVS Pharmacy across the street and a Starbucks 2 blocks up. Some of our favorite resturants close by were Gadsby's Tavern and the Columbus Firehouse and for seafood, The Fish Market.  The Fish Market has no atmosphere, but the biggest oysters in town. The hotel has a free shuttle to and from the airport and free wine from 5-6.  The staff was helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",To be in the midst of Old Town Stay here! Very centrally located overall great place. Would stay again if not here at another Kimpton property. 11 out of 10!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Valet service was unorganized upon our arrival - I had to go find them and then my husband had to drive around the block until they could accommodate us- our room was not ready (even at 5pm when we arrived) - they took our phone number to call us when it was ready and then never called - we called back at 7:30pm. - On one of our days our room was never serviced - took 45 minutes to have someone come and give us clean towels - staff was curt when I called them-- had to extend our stay one night due to weather - was told it was all set when I called from DC but when we got back to the hotel the desk was unaware that we were staying another night - lots of confusion about us having to move to another room or not move as they were doing renovations on our floor. Just very unorganized.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",we have stayed there before and found it excellent. it rematns our favorite spot because of its location and service
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice hotel and right in Old Town. Parking is pretty pricey though.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Hotel Monaco exemplifies service. This is a must stay and is well worth the money.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is in a great location on King st.  Walk a few blocks in either direction and there are plenty of restaurants and bars.  It was a short drive into DC. Less than 10 minutes to the national harbor and about 20 min with traffic to the national mall. There is also a metro stop nearby the hotel.  The room was spacious and had a nice sized bathroom.  The parking at the hotel was $29, but there is a garage right next door that charges $5 for the day. I would definitely stay again when visiting DC."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It's right in the middle of Olde Towne Alexandria, which had lots of things to see and do, and a great variety of restaurants (we recommend Bertucci's pizza!). A free trolly passes in front of the hotel. Our room was fairly large and well decorated. The bed was as comfy as any we've ever slept on. The hotel lobby was a little warm (A/C trouble? Eco-friendly policy? Our guess is the former.), but the temp was still comfortable, and it is not unheard of for hotel lobbies to be too cold. The in-room A/C unit was a bit noisy, but the kind you can easily tune out. The pool heat wasn't working, which is bad news for an indoor pool. Some of these minor issues may have been overcome by the time you read this, so check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and it was worth every cent we paid."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was great...walking distance to the Metro to get directly into DC, but was an oasis from the big city. Plenty of great restaurants and buskers with a side order of haunted buildings!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This place was great. The staff should be an example to other hotel staffs when it comes to customer service. Close to dining and shopping in a quaint colonial environment, but also a convenient train-ride into the nation's capitol for sightseeing. I truly have no complaints and would stay here over and over."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were able to stay at a nice hotel and take the train into DC.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was a wonderful stay.  The bed was so comfortable.  The staff very accommodating.  The car was ready when we left.  Very nice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is absolutely beautiful! It is located in a great area for shopping, eating and general fun. The waterfront is only a few blocks away and they provided a shuttle to the Metro. I'd definitely stay here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",received charges from Mini bar in hotel that i never touched
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My daughter and I were touring the Wash. DC area and we appreciated the charming and historical setting of Alexandria. It was nice to be staying outside of the city but with the conviences of being close to the Metro and Reagan as well as the hotel shuttle service. The Monaco is clean, has elegant but fun decor and the support staff very efficent. The only minor complaint would be our room being located across from the elevators which made for constant pinging and people traffic noise."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had a great time. The hotel was perfectly located. Staff was nice. It was great
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderfully comfortable, and decorated in magnificent style. Highly recommended."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Already a very big Kimpton fan so, this one was easy. Perfect location in Old Town. Very eclectic as usual. Nice room that rivals the Ritz."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is beautiful our stay was fantastic! Would highly recommend this hotel!!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Pleased that there was a free shuttle to Reagan International Airport.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was well maintained , but the room size was small for two queen beds. The vallet was a blessing and the staff was extremely nice."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","An ideal hotel for seeing the many sights in DC via free trolley close by and the Metro. Old Alexandria itself offers history, shopping and fine restaurants on the doorstep. The hotels own restaurant, Jackson 20, offers a good choice for breakfast and dinner. The service throughout a nine day stay was superb."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff was extremely friendly...right in the middle of Old Town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Stayed SA-TU for the 2013 Inauguration. Selected the Hotel Monaco sight-unseen based on user reviews. I'd return again! Lovely hotel. Clean, comfortable and pet (dog) friendly (even have dog beds & bowls in the room!). Doorman, Majid, is great and helpful, as we're all the staff. During our stay, had complimentary 'happy hour' daily from 5p-6p. Guests can also take the complimentary trolley to King St. Metro station, about a mile away. Lots of great restaurants & shopping within easy walking distance. Loved it!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is within easy walking distance to Old Town and there is free King Street trolley service to the King Street Metro, making a subway commute to the sights of DC very easy. Easy walking to shops and good restaurants in Old Town. Parking is tight in the hotel garage, so take advantage of the hotel's valet parking (same cost of $24 for 24 hours). The staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful. An added plus is that the hotal is pet-friendly. If you don't bring the dog, make sure you ask for a goldfish when you check in! Great place to stay and we will be back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco is well appointed, charming, and the staff is second to none. It is in the perfect location on King Street. The pool is great for kids. The rooms are luxurious."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very friendly staff, great location. A fun place to stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Room was roomy, nicely decorated. Weekend nightlife made for a lot of noise, but very quiet during the week. Really enjoyed the hotel. Had lifeguard (?!?) on duty. Pool was great, no crowds, but refilled water during stay so was very cold. All in all, would definitely come back and makes us want to use other hotel monaco/kimpton hotels."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Kimpton Hotels are fun hotels period. The energy and vibe when you walk in hotel is like no other hotel I���ve ever stayed in except another Kimpton. Since we were staying over a weekend, the hotel was packed with wedding parties which made the happy hour time very lively.The room was fabulous and not cookie cutter. The robes were almost worth the price of admission! Love the d��cor and the staff was very friendly. Really enjoyed talking with folks during the happy hour. The only complaint is they really need more space ��� it���s that popular.It���s a pet friendly hotel and we did not travel with a pet. We only saw a few dogs and we never heard a dog when we were in our room. Ed did say a flea jumped on is hand in the lobby, but I didn���t have the same experience. As a cat owner, I know the random flea is a fact of life."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We where very pleased with our Hotel and the location. We where within walking distance of the Metro, lots and lots of great restaurants, and many historical sites including Christ Church where President George Washington and Robert E Lee attended. Everyone was very helpful. We had a great time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Alexandria on yksi niist�� harvinaisista USAn kaupungeista, joissa v��ki kulkee kadulla. Kaupunki on er����nlainen vanhan ajan el��v�� museo, pikku putiikkeja ja ravintoloita p����kadulla. Samalla kadulla on t��m�� Hotelli Monaco, joka on hyvin persoonallinen ja vieh��tt��v��. Saimme ullakkokerroksen tilavan huoneen ja viihdyimme hyvin."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The color schemes and patterns from the lobby throughout the hotel were unusual, but well done. I truly enjoyed my stay at the hotel over Memorial Day weekend. Old Alexandria was readily available, as was the Metro to go into Washington. It was great to see all the kids and pets in the lobby, too. My only complaint was that the air conditioner in the room was loud when it kicked on, though very effective."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We came down to see a local concert for my friends birthday.  New to the city, the Hotel Monaco was in the perfect location!  I've stayed in Philly and Baltimore Kimpton hotels and this one was my favorite by far."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service. Finally took taxiThe check out desk service messed up our bill. We had to return to correct. The wrong amount is still pending on credit cardThere was no coffe maker in room and lobby coffee wasn't available until 7:00 am. We were lucky starbucks was near
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We were very pleased with the hotel. The location is perfect and the rooms are beautiful. Our only complaint about our experience was with the service at the restaurant -- the servers were inattentive and the kitchen very slow.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I loved how my dog was welcomed. The front desk staff was outstanding. Doggie happy hour was great. The maid did not speak English so it was hard to communicate with her, yet she did an outstanding job. The men who opened doors and did the valet parking were obnoxious. They wanted a tip for just opening the door. If I tipped them for every time they got my car and opened a door I would have spent an extra $100. I bought some wine and one of the men kept bugging me to give him a bottle of wine. These men would stand around and talk in their native tongue which I think is rude. I speak their language and they were saying rude things about me and other guests. Unacceptable. That said, I would stay here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",���just fantastic on all fronts���like all Kimpton hotels
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel was acceptable and the staff was very respectful and helpful. The restaurant was the best part of the experience--great food, an exceptional waitstaff and fair prices."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, nice wine social event"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Cet hôtel est très très bien.Parfaitement bien situé dans Alexandria Old Town: tout le charme à côté de Washington sans ses inconvénients.Le métro est accessible avec un tramway gratuit (10mn) et DC à 15/20mn; et il y a en plus une navette Apt.On ne regretterait même pas Georgetown car les commerces sont plus dynamiques, les maisons ravissantes, les restaurants bons et très accessibles, et les bords du Potomac qui finalisent la touche romantique : un must!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Over all nice place.Be aware that WiFi is abut $10 per day.  (its 2017, most hotels provide free WiFi)Parking is about $38 per day (self parking).  If you look across the street from the parking garage entrance, you'll see a parking garage for $10 per day."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Fabulous location! Very ""hip"" place! Loved that it was very dog friendly even though we didn't have ours with us. In the center of everything."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is a fun hotel in the middle of Alexandria. The room was wonderful. Overlooked the main street that was lit for the Christmas holiday. the beds were comfortable...internet easily available and free...great robes in the room! A Zebra robe and a leopard robe! Check in was easy and the people at the main desk were very helpful. Recommended an amazing French place to eat near by! Probably the best meal I've ever had. The free shuttle to the Metro stops a block away. Walking distance to waterfront art galleries and great eating places. All in all...a really fine few days away.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I stayed here for our 1 year Wedding Anniversary. The hotel is great. Loved the staff, location, and comfort of the hotel. The Jackson 20 was great for a late night cocktail and brunch. We love the Alexandria Hotel Monaco. They made our Anniversary great!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great find in Alexandria. Very modern, eclectic decor and centrally located. If you are looking for something different."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Hotel Monaco in Old Town Alexandria is a great hotel.  Very nice. Very Kimpton! A word to the wise.  Do not take a room on the 6th Floor, the top floor of the building.   Due to the buildings architecture (very colonial, very appropriate for Old Town) the rooms on the 6th floor were very small and the ceilings were at an angle with a small dormer window.   I felt a little closed in.  They were very helpful and moved me to a room lower down with a little terrace that opened to the hotel's central courtyard.  Very Nice. Also,  take public transportion or taxi's the valet is a little slow and a little pricey."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was our first time at the Monaco. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is only a few blocks from the waterfrtont and King St. is lined with quaint shops.Our only complaints were that hotel staff did not, nor does the hotel's website offer options for parking other than the valet parking offered by the hotel (there were 3 parking garages within 2 blocks of the hotel) and the room temperature seemed warm compared to the temperature set on the thermostat--65. That said, all the staff we encountered were superb."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","THE STAFF IS CHEARFULL HELPFULL,HOUSE KEEPING IS A BIT OUT OF TOUCHALLTOGETHER MY STAY WAS GOOD AND COMFORTABLE"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had such a wonderful time at your lovely hotel!Having dogs around made me feel quite at home. The only thing that kept this stay from being perfect was the sound of the elevators thruout the night--we were right across the hall.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","When describing this hotel, one can not ignore the staff. Everyone was very helpful and pleasant while helping with directions, recommendations, etc.What a great ""Kid-Friendly"" place. If visiting, be sure to ask for a goldfish. One is delivered to your room and becomes part of the family for your stay.You can't get a better location: local shops and restaurants within walking distance with a sort walk to the metro station.We plan a return stay!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is tastefully furnished, beds are comfy, staff is exceptional. Located in a historical district adds to the ambiance instead of feeling like the hotel district! Great French bakery located next door with good coffee and breakfast selections. We are a family of 4, spent 5 nights, and would stay again in a heart beat."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotell som helt klart kan anbefalles. F��r minus for ekstra kostnader for nett p�� rom samt at det ikke er kaffemaskin p�� rommet. Ellers helt Toppers. Flott omr��de i bo i.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is an outstanding hotel.  It has been completely refurbished and the new decor is great.  The location, King Street in Old Town Alexandria, provides good proximity to great restaurants and gret local shopping.  This is a great place to stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I don't treat myself to fancy hotels often but I decided to do so for a night for my birthday. I could not have been happier. I just wish I had more time to enjoy the hotel. Room was immaculate and I loved the d��cor. Even took a bath! I will definitely stay here again when I want to splurge a bit.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Convenient, dependable hotel. Easy access to the  metro using the Alexandria trolley. Lots of places to walk, shop, eat, and drink."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Overall not bad for the price. decent restaurant freindly staff
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was great!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel staff were always helpful and friendly, made us feel cared for. It was close to the waterfront and also having the trolley running up and down King street made it close to anything in the area. A good price for a quality hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always a pleasure. Very convenient. Well maintained. Friendly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Always a pleasure. Very convenient. Well maintained. Friendly
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The wine tasting in the afternoon was great! Wish they sampled and showed off VA. Wines. Cant beat the location for dining or going out for the night. The staff was extremely friendly.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed for 5 nights long enough to get over first impressions. The location is wonderful. Right on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, and down close to the harbor. Very easy to walk for anything you need. Out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. And with the King Street Trolley you can easily get to the Metro. The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.The lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the ""boutique hotel"" was not for us. There seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. From the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. To the ""doormen"" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. Then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7AM so was no use to us. The free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form I have ever seen) To the dogs barking in the lobby. I like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Good hotel in Old Town. Food is good and the location is great. Valet parking a plus.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This hotel is extremely nice. Rooms are very comfortable and very clean. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again!!!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A great short stay in Old Town. The pet friendly nature of the hotel added to the charm (even though I didn't bring my dog)
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location in Alexandria. Very kid and dog friendly. Small but lovely indoor swimming pool. Eclectic boutique. Afternoon wine tasting in the cozy lobby is nice touch. Great value. Highly recommended.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Okay, you can access Wi-fi, but only after becoming a Kimpton member, which involves writing a book and giving up substantial amounts of data about yourself. Data that is apparently worth about $12.99 to Kimpton, since that's what they charge for 24 hours of access. I found it insulting after paying this kind of money for a room, when almost any of the 'lesser' chains would provide it for free. Fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight. Valet parking was a disaster- very disorganized and we had to go find our own car after waiting on the sidewalk for a long while."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We rated this stay a 5 because we were very happy but I guess if we had suggestions they would be a small refrigerator in the cabinet..
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Room was comfortable, hypo-allergenic pillows were provided upon request, windows open. The lobby is musty and old. There is an adjacent restaurant that is closed during check-in times, partially, with an unimpressive bar. Good beer selection, but this is not a place to hangout or people-watch. Room service, breakfast, was 30 min late and I had to call to remind them. Food was mediocre...clumpy grits, dry eggs, no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I spent 3 nights at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Alexandria while in town for a conference. I opted for this hotel over the conference hotel because I wanted to stay in an area where I would have more options for meals, shopping, and site seeing. I was very happy with my choice! The location was great for exploring Old Town Alexandria, and for accessing the Mount Vernon Trail for running and biking. My room was very comfortable and included many thoughtful details - plush bathrobe, yoga mat, minibar with a variety of snacks, lots of regular and USB outlets, free wifi. The hotel was in great shape, and I appreciated the free coffee service in the morning and wine happy hour in the afternoon. I was delighted to discover that the hotel has bikes that are free for guests' use - I wish I had been able to use them more than once! My room service breakfast was pricey but delicious and arrived exactly when ordered. And I was delighted to receive a surprise from the hotel one afternoon - a bottle of wine and a plate of snacks! My only complaint about my stay was the noise from a neighboring room's TV late one night, and this was immediately resolved by a quick call to the front desk. I had heard only good things about Kimpton hotels prior to my stay, and now I understand why."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great Hotel, staff and location, unfortunately the first night a water line broke, the fire alarm went off for more than an hour, and the hotel lobby was partially affected by the water, the staff did a great job cleaning the place and finally back to normal.The second night of my stay, another problem with the water lines, this time, I had NO HEATER, and NO HOT WATER, in a low 30's weather !Again, the staff did what they could, and offered me a refund for one of the nights cost, and whenthey realized that my booking was thru EXPEDIA, told me that they were going to settle the refund with you guys directly, please take a note and follow up with them."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel staff were exceptionally professional, helpful and courteous.  Enjoyed the morning coffee, afternoon lemonade and the physical fitness facilities. Hotel is located in a very rich and diverse area of town, close to the river; as well as to the DC Metro line.  The only downside was a very noisy Saturday night/Sunday morning in our hallway with inconsiderate guests talking very loudly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful hotel, great location. Loved the free wine in the lobby. Room was comfortable and roomy but the bathroom was too small. Trying to get ready in the morning required taking turns. No other mirror with an outlet anywhere else in the room. Jackson 20, restaurant on site, was fantastic. Room service was very slow in the morning."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Terrific experience at this hotel. Do not eat in the hotel restaurant - service was slow and food was cold.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Meg og min mor var her i to dager for �� reise inn til DC en dag. Hotellet l�� n��rme alt i Alexandria. Det g��r en gratis shuttle buss fra sj��en opp til metroen. Kjempe grei. De har vin time hver dag, kjempe hyggelig atmosf��re i lobbyen under vin timen. Eneste som var �� si noe p�� var AC, den br��ket veldig. Men ellers s�� anbefaler jeg veldig dette hotellet. MEN hvis du ikke t��ler hund, s�� er ikke dette hotellet for deg. Masse hunder der."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Simply wonderful.  Location was great.  That's it!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is beautiful, and the staff professional and responsive!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Wasn't attentiveGot sick the next dayWhen I ask for subtype of compensation for condition manager didn't careFront desk was good and helpful as possible but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location in Old Town Alexandria, VA. Jackson 20 restaurant in the hotel was excellent for dinner."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","When I return to the area I will definitely book here again.  The staff is friendly and efficient, the rooms are great, and there's a nice restaurant attached."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco is a beautifully decorated hotel in the heart of Old Town.  Dog friendly, this hotel met our needs and the best part was the complimentary wine hour."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Beautiful hotel with fantastic service! The rooms are perfect and the bed was very comfortable. We had a great stay and will stay here again or at any Kimpton Hotel in any area we will vacation in. Love that you cater to our pets :)
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I requested an early check-in as I was arriving at 0900.  Sadly, I wasn't able to get into the room until 1400.  That was the only disappointment with the hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Although a ""chain"", this is the most delightful, whimsical, unique hotels I have seen. The bed and bedding were conducive to a great sleep. There is attention to detail throughout the hotel. We were in Alexandria for my husbands surgery for a knee replacement, and when we returned the bell staff were falling over themselves to be of assistance. Room service was prompt and delicious. From now on, when traveling, I will make it a point to find a Kimpton hotel whenever possible."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Far too expensive . no shampoo in the bathroom. No included breakfast. parking $27.00 night is redicilious , Alexandria room taxes $42.00 redicilious,  Have stayed in rooms all over the world and for this place is far overpriced."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We love visiting Old Town Alexandria VA and usually stay at another hotel.  However, that hotel was booked so we stayed at the Hotel Monaco.  Loved it!!!!  Will be using this hotel for our future stays."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This boutique hotel was gorgeous. The way it was decorated was so neat! I've stayed in a many hotels but this one was the best! The location was excellent, right in the heart of Old town Alexandria, you could walk to everything. Highly recommend it!! Service was excellent as well!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",See comments at check-in
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",great little escape a short metro ride from D.C. Loved Alexandria. Very fiendly staff. Good food at Jefferson 20(restaurant next to hotel).
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Check in was a breeze, room a/c was running so it wasn't the typical stuffy room upon entry."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","overall, it was worth it; however, they really do allow dogs and there were lots of them. they only have one floor that is dog free and all rooms were taken on that floor. we had two dogs barking on our floor and after complaining over a 2-3 hour period, one of the families checked out. the hotel did offer to move us and gave us coupons for continental breakfast but again, we were going to a floor that might have dogs. we stayed in our original room and it all worked out by about 9 pm, but then I was freaked out that dogs had stayed in our room before, peeing, jumping on beds etc. I have dogs, I know dogs, it's just odd that such a nice hotel is also 'the dog' hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was our second time staying at this hotel. Great location, great staff, wonderful, comfortable room."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Beautiful hotel, exceeded my expectations...would recommend to anyone."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We arrived at hotel 1 hour before check-in and got into our room right away, which was great after a 7 hour drive. The room was perfect, comfy bed, nice bathrooms, fluffy pillows.  Nice!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We'll be back !
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice hotel in a fantastic location.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Second stay at Hotel Monaco. I think it's now my regular!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My only complaint: newspapers showed up at everyone else's door in the morning except ours. When I asked why we hadn't received it, they said you only needed to ask. Of course, I didn't know to ask because it was never offered. Otherwise, great hotel."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My girlfriend and I had traveled for two days straight and wanted to treat her to a nice hotel. Hotel Monaco accommodated us in every way imaginable and made our stay one of the most memorable in our lives.

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Perfectly located in center of Old Town Alexandria, convenient to many shopping and dining options. Hotel was quiet and well maintained, staff was professional and friendly and bed was very comfortable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything about the hotel was so fantastic!! The decor was so unique and eclectic....and coming from L.A. it was like being at home! The staff were incredibly helpful...I was able to check in early, I ran out of toothpaste and they were nice enough to run some up to my room for me in a matter of minutes. The very best thing about the Hotel Monaco was the location, location, location!! It is centered right in hub of all the action in beautiful Old Town Alexandria. It was perfect and I would definately stay there again!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Close to the waterfront, but still only a 15 minute walk to the Metro, Hotel Monaco is well situated for exploring Alexandria and DC. Our rooms on the 6th floor weren't large, but were well appointed and decorated, with a large well-stocked bathroom. We were on the quiet back of the hotel, although we could slightly hear weddings taking place in the courtyard below. a second upholstered chair (there was one plus a desk chair), would have been nice. The room was quite clean. Service was helpful and unobtrusive. You can save on parking if you park under the building across the street to the north instead of using the valet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel looks nice, lobby staff are pleasant. VERY difficult to pull up to front of hotel; only a few spots and double parking is necessary. The garage was difficult to navigate my SUV in to so I ended paying for valet not to deal with it. I ordered hot water for tea one night and after 1.5 hours it never came and I canceled the order. The restaurant staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was GREASY and my collard greens were gritty. My breakfast room service was fine. GREAT location for stores, restaurants, walking around."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel is only minutes to Mt. Vernon. Parking was especially helpful.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very clean and well appointed rooms with nice amenities. I no longer have a pet, but enjoyed seeing that pets are welcome. I would stay here again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful stay, great staff, convenient location, nice happy hour, beautiful accommodations.  We'll be back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We were extremely happy with our stay. The service was outstanding, and the room was comfortable. We enjoyed the complimentary wine service in the afternoon. The hotel is close to the metro, with a free shuttle ride to the metro station, which made it easy to visit national monuments/places. We will definitely return."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great breakfast close to sights and good shopping and restaurants
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The leopard print boxers and pajamas on sale in the closet was a little creepy, but my overall experience was just OK."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My stay at the Kimpton Monaco Alexandria was awful. First of all, the hotel staff did not give out accurate information regarding parking and what fees would be charged. They told my husband one price and told me another. On top of that, they charged us for parking on an individual daily basis and a nightly basis so we got charged double. When I spoke with the front desk they said that it was 'just the way it works'. Absolutely horrible. The front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! The room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. I understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. Do not stay here! The hotel staff are awful and inconsistent, the room is not the same as advertised, and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Love the area! Close to shops and restaurants nearby. Doormen were very nice and helpful, But theres one girl at front desk can work on her hospitality skills. Cute rooms but a bit outdated with some chips here and there. Overall I would come back to this hotel!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very satisfied. Convenient to tje water and a short walk to the metro. Beautiful neighborhood with lots to see and do. There were huge thunderstorms while we stayed and they were very gracious and accommodating during the ordeal. Would definitely stay there again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location, location, location. Business or pleasure if you are going to D.C. and don't want to deal with D.C., Alexandria is the place and this Hotel is in the middle of everything. The have valet parking for $27 a day but right next to Madeline's(across the street) is a garage that cost $10 a day. Everything was clean, staff was helpful. Lobby was kind of small but the bar is right next door. Complimentary coffee in the a.m. and complimentary wine in the p.m."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Just had to get out of town. Old Alexandria is such fun and the very best place to stay smack in the middle of King St is the Monaco.  Great big warm fire in lobby.  Free wine party every day at 5.  Terrific staff and lovely rooms.    One of the areas best indoor heated pools makes this hotel one you hate to leave even for all the fun right outside its doors.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a great stay.  Very centrally located in Old Towne Alexandria, a charming southern town!  A little ways from the metro station, but there is a trolley that runs from 10-10 every 15 mins.  It was a lifesaver in the rain!  The staff was wonderful.  The kids loved the pool.  Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby. Happy hour every evening.  Lots of dogs and very dog-friendly!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Amazing hotel, amazing staff great areaThroughly recommend stay"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Second time staying at a Kimpton in Alexandria. Predictably nice and total quality all the way around. Staff super helpful and friendly!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Second time staying at a Kimpton in Alexandria. Predictably nice and total quality all the way around. Staff super helpful and friendly!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",There was a dog barking next door. That was only negative. Otherwise great hotel
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very comfortable accommodations and well-designed rooms. Good value for the room price and location, but we felt nickel-and-dimed by all the add-ons. They charged nearly $30/night for parking, $15/night for a refrigerator in the room (we're traveling with an infant so needed something for milk storage), and another charge (I can't remember how much) for wi-fi access. A truly high-class hotel would never charge extra for a refrigerator in the room or wi-if access. That said, it was still a nice price for the quality of the rooms, the staff was friendly, and we enjoyed our stay very much."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","What a lovely hotel! It's right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, and close to everything you could possibly want. We walked down to the river, then back up on the next street over to have dinner at Gadsby's Tavern, which was amazing. The hotel staff are very polite, all have beautiful smiles on their faces, the rooms are lovely and extremely comfortable - overall just a great experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at the Monaco for only one night.  Located in a quaint area of Alexandria with lots of shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance.  The hotel has a parking garage with an entrance conveniently located just around the corner.  Not cheap at $29/night and a bit tight in spots, especially for large vehicles such as SUVs (we drive a Prius).  The staff were excellent and they had a decent fitness room--treadmills, elliptical and stationary bikes.  All-in-all, very happy with our experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel with helpful staff in a super location.  A luxurious and fun time!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very small room, but the location on King street was great. I will bring my own pillow next time as the ones in room were terrible. On an upside very dog friendly and fun wine reception every night."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Sehr gut renoviertes Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage Old Town Alexandria VAich kenne es noch von fr��her (damals in die Jahre gekommendes Holliday Inn) undhabe es fasst nicht wiedererkannt - so angenehm ��berrascht.Gutes Restaurant mit Barbereich
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",H��tel super . Tr��s bonne adresse �� conseiller.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I would warn people against this hotel. My reservation was lost and I was put in a cramped, musty smelling room. The hallways were dark and creepy. On top of everything they put a $651 hold on my card even though I had already paid in full when I booked my room. What did they expect me to order six hundred dollars in room service? Management was very unhelpful. I was given an email address for the manager instead of a phone number and still have not heard back. Save yourself the stress and disappointment and go somewhere else."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the wall. Front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","They overbooked the hotel and did not contact me to help me make other arrangements. I arrive into DC on a late flight, got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that there were no more rooms. They put me in a cab to go to another hotel. Not exactly what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","THE CLEANEST, MOST QUIET HOTEL ROOM EVER STAYED IN.WONDERFUL, WOULD BOOK AGAIN."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had an unforgettable vacation at Hotel Monaco. The hotel lobby is so inviting. The gym and pool areas are up to date and clean! Our room was so nice, we wished we could have spent more time there. We will be staying there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice room on top floor, spacious, Jackson 20 restaurant good option, all worked well. Nobisdues with Other guests' noise or pets reported by others. A bit cramped on street in front for loading/unloading but prompt valet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We were there for 9 days with our Schnauzer and our stay was wonderful from start to finish. I have never seen hotel that is so pet-oriented, and the entire property is bezutiful, comfortable with great food ND. Lose proximity to everything! We loved every minute and we're actually sad to leave. All of the staff there be a me friends, and the entire experience e was amazing!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great Location, Good Service and unusual decor.  A little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel and that we were on the doggie floor.  Not bad, just not expected.  Had we known, we would have asked for the pet free floor but was not aware of that option until check out time."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Extremely limited room service menu for breakfast. Terrible service in the restaurant. Make you go to the lobby for coffee in the morning. At their wine happy hour, served Moscato as the white wine (without a doubt the sweetest white ever). The wallpaper in the bathroom almost induced vertigo. Tons of light came into the room at night through the door."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Your staff was very helpful and efficient....from the doorman/valet to the maintenance man who came to adjust the TV. The location couldn't have been better! We would definitely recommend this hotel to others
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Like most Kimpton hotels, rooms are very nice, luxurious and colorful- great departure from standard hotel fair. Great bathroom w/ white marble although vanity is small. Try to get room w/ balcony facing interior courtyard. Cant beat Old Town location, even for access to Gaylord Convention Center or Crystal City."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The location, the service, the hotel - all great! Pool area was not crowded, indoor and relaxing. Right in the middle of many historical and interesting sites with easy access to others. Complimentary shuttle to/from the airport was a plus!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was beautifully decorated and in a perfect location!  All night kitchen & door to door was awesome!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Continues to be one of the better value hotels in Alexandria. Rooms (at least the one we had) clean, comfortable but not expansive. The free wine happy hour is best skipped for a beer or wine in the neighborhood. Skip the Mexican food on King Street as well."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel Monaco is an adorable hotel. We loved everything about it from the decor to the cocktail hour in the afternoon. The only reason we did not rate this property 5 stars is because there was construction going on and we needed to move rooms 3 times. Maybe next time we will bring our dog since it is dog friendly!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice hotel, and nicely appointed room and common areas. Best location in center of Old Town. Only bug-a-boo was the indifferent check-in. The woman who checked me in failed to mention that the in-room mini bar required a key (available from the front desk), that there was a complimentary wine service in the evening, and that guests were being given a discount in the restaurant. Had to find all this out from another guest while in the elevator. Otherwise, the staff was very nice and accommodating. Rooms are beautifully appointed, but the mattresses are very firm - my preference is for a softer mattress."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Main problem was with air conditioning in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly. When room temp reached 74 degrees (set on 68) I called the front desk. We were assured an engineer would be up immediately. 20 minutes later--I called again. Front desk had no record of the first call. By now the room temp was 82 degrees. The front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. We left for the day and returned 7 pm. The a/c was STILL not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. Our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. We asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.Second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at Arlington Cemetery. The night before, my son needed his shoes shined. We called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. Next morning: shoes had not been touched. When I complained to the front desk, I was told: ""Why didn't you bring them down to the desk? That's what you should have done.""Bottom line: this is a nicely redecorated hotel in a prime Old Town Alexandria location, but I won't be staying there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Pet friendly is one thing. But there were entirely too many large dogs - in the lobby, at the happy hour and in the elevators. If you have allergies, like we do, this is a major problem that we were not prepared for. Our room was pet free, but dogs were on the furniture in the lobby and shaking their dander in all the public spaces. The elevators had slobber smell. There has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not. Disappointed for sure - we were there for a wedding."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Just wished they would have given us 2 queens per room. The doubles was kinda of tight for me & my husband to sleep in one bed while our 2 boys slept in the other and we're average size adults.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Friendly staff, clean rooms and a great location -what else can you ask for?"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Every thing PERFECT!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent ambiance and wonderful courtesy.There were some troubles with the Air Conditioning. The staff acknowledged that some of the rooms were having problems and after a short attempt to find a similarly priced room without airconditioning issues they finally upgraded us to a better room.Hotel Restaurant was delicious and service was excellent. The restaurant manager treated us especially well and gave us consideration for a special event we were celebrating.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Magnifique hôtel, idéalement situé dans la ville d'Alexandria, proche de Washington !Personnel très accueillant, chambre et sale de bain très propre et très bien décoré.Nombreux restaurants à quelques mètres de là (restaurant de l'hotel assez cher).Piscine et sale de sport à disposition.Une adresse à ne pas rater !"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Alexandria Monaco is a lovely and boutique style hotel in a fantastic location. It is close to some of the nicest eateries in D.C. The amenities are of a quality standard and the staff are very helpful & welcoming. The only complaint is that the adjoining restaurant was not of the same quality or price. The menu lacked variety and was over priced in comparison to the other restaurants one block down. We would return in a heatbeat!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location, room, facilities all great. The surprise was the staff quality. Very personable and helpful. Our first reaction was this management knows how to accomodate."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",great hotel and room. Close to everything. Great Happy HOur each evening!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",great hotel and room. Close to everything. Great Happy HOur each evening!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I got this room through Expedia.  The hotel gave me one of the worst rooms they could.  I have stayed there before when I made the reservations directly through the hotel and the room was MUCH better.  This room overlooked the back roof of the hotel, was as far away from the elevator as possible and was very small.  I think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very noisy hotel! Dog in the room next to us barked for 7 hours! Could not get a belman when we were leaving, We saw them outside the window below! Said we had to pay for valet and there was no such charge! week later still holding our money! Desk was rushing us thru our check in! Cleaning staff actually make noise so you get up in the morning! We wont stay there anymore!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Had a great time with my family.  Great for adults and families
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel is very nice even though it's older. The rooms are small but beds comfy! It's steps from all kinds of bars and restaurants.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff is over the top friendly and supportive. The staffs superior and wonderful attitude makes it a fantastic place I highly recommend..
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wanted a 1 night stay downtown Alexandria and found the great rate at this hotel. This location was steps away from Old Town restaurants and shops. The room was large, immaculate and beautifully decorated. Right down to the leopard and zebra striped robes. The staff couldnt have been any nicer! We will definitely go back!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff was always very friendly.  It was nice to be greeted at the door every time you walked in.  The location was great for getting around Alexandria.  The room was large and the plasma tv was very nice.  Very comfortable bed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent location for Old Town Alexandria and free town trolley to metro. Gorgeous lobby and rooms. Very classy.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Loved the decor and the location.  I especially loved that the hotel is pet friendly, and the late check out time.The walls are a little too thin, making it very easy to hear what's going on in the hall while trying to sleep."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was my first Kimpton hotel stay and it was wonderful. The service and staff are really great. I loved the hotel look and decor. Also this hotel is right in the middle of great stores and restaurants. I'd stay here again and again next time I'm in the area.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I needed to hole myself up in a hotel...away from distractions, to get urgent work completed for one of my best clients. I chose Old Town because I could take a few breaks, do a little shoping, walking, etc.There were a few hiccups over the weekend but the staff took care of everything and I am pleased and very greatful. I would come back to this hotel anytime!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I have stayed here before and it is the mid-level of the Kimptons in Alexandria. Perhaps it's an east-coast thing, but I have a problem with guests who think everyone will be as in love with their dog as they are! And I am a dog person.Kimpton explains that Mr. Kimpton loved dogs so they're ""dog friendly"". But, dogs on the leashes at the wine social in the lobby and the yapping in the hall was overly accomodative"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is my second time staying at this hotel and my sister and I love it.We have come to Alexandria for 3 years as a weekend getaway from NYC. This hotel is perfectly located in the heart of town with easy access. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Not one complaint!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The rooms and lobby were beautiful. The staff was very helpfull and very friendly, not at all stuffy. It's in a very nice location, lots of shopping and restaurants. Though it is not close to the metro we will definitly return."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We have stayed at the Monaco many times. The staff is welcoming and helpful. The rooms are clean, very well furnished and comfortable. The animal skin patterned robes are fun, and pets are welcomed, not just tolerated. The hotel is in the middle of ""downtown"" Alexandria, with all attractions and restaurants in easy walking distance."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great hotel, central location. Super staff and great rooms. Restaurant excellent."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco is about 4 blocks from the Potomac River. It is about a mile to the Metro - going the other way. Walking to the Metro is too far, so there is either a bus that goes by or a free trolley that goes by about 3 times an hour. Hotel Monaco is in a very good location - close to the Potomac, lots of restaurants and lots of shops. The staff was very helpful."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great stay right on King St. Everything was within walking distance. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. We stayed for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The only complaint was that the walls were so thin. We could hear the people next to us and people in the hallways as if they were in the room with us.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything about the Monaco was great - location, wine happy hour, nice pool, great brunch on new years day."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",In the heart of old town Alexandria. One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","great location, great atmosphere. a real treat. excellent , clean and stylish rooms. super way to have a family stay with the large loft situation. living area as you walk in and then a staircase up to the KING bed. great bath tub. great blue color on the outside of the entry to the side of building. complimentary wine from 5- 6 in the lobby."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel had a lot of character, was ideally located in a great neighborhood in walking distance to many shops and restaurants. However, it was 13 blocks from the metro train station, but, a straight shot on the public bus. Parking is steep at $24 a day, however, metered street parking is available. I would stay there again! The hotel is pet friendly, but the third floor was offered to us as a designated pet-free floor.The hotel restaurant, Jackson 20, had a great breakfast menu. The bar was cool, offering many specialty drinks.I would definitely stay here again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",O ��nico por��m do hotel �� com rela����o ao aluguel de carro: muito caro para deixar estacionado o ve��culo no parking do hotel. De resto: gostei muito.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent location in Alexandria, with a lot of good place to walk to. The metro station is a bit far but there's a free trolley on King St. to take you there."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Awesome stay. Thank u. Super dog friendly. Don't change a thing...
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice hotel in a great location.  Easy metro ride to DC. Staff was very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay. Cost of parking is a bit steep, but that seems to be standard for the area."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, room was wonderful. Need to do something about dog smell though. I have dogs but could tell it was pet friendly, and windows didn't open so no way to get fresh air. Would stay there again though. convenient to everything."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a wonderful six nights at this Hotel Monaco.  It had all of the amenities that we wanted during our trip to DC and the staff could have not been more accommodating.  The history of the area was fantastic and the hotel was located right in the middle of so much to see.  I would recommend this to anyone who is traveling to the DC area.  Great for families, couples, business travelers, etc.  Even dogs joined in on the happy hour fun.  The courtesy and humor of the staff added to the experience.  I can't wait to return!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We enjoyed the location of this hotel a lot. The decor and overall look and feel of the hotel was great! We really enjoyed the getaway and all the restaurants nearby.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","What a great time. Did not know the St Patrick's Day parade was the weekend we were in Dc. Fun times, and great lobby. Love the Wine reception every night!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Monaco was a very pleasant surprise. We thought old-style hotel hospitality was dead, but it's not. The room was terrific, the lobby (Living Room) was comfortable for simply sitting and reading or getting a cup of morning coffee and the staff wasn't just friendly and helpful, they honored the one thing that makes a guest experience great: ""find a way to say yes"". They found a way to help us get around, find great restaurants (theirs is great, too) and simply made the entire work/vacation experience memorable. We will be back."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is the second time I have stayed this year. The staff is always so kind and efficient. The rooms are made for comfort and I have never had any Internet issues. One is steps ways from great eating and shopping venues. Highly recommend.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I stayed at the hotel February 13-16th. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The decor was absolutely divine. I loved the wine hour in the evenings. The king deluxe room I stayed in was very spacious and the bed was ultra comfortable. My room also overlooked the courtyard which was a nice touch. There was a little snafu regarding when I wanted my room cleaned but the manager Michael did make sure that the situation was rectified immediately. That was the only hiccup I experienced during my stay. I felt like royalty when I left and entered the hotel. The doorman always greeted me with a smile and welcomed me back to the hotel. I love where the hotel is located in Old Town. There are so many shops, bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left. I felt very safe even walking at night. It is a quaint town with lots of charm. I will definitely be staying at Hotel Monaco again in the very near future. I cannot wait to visit during spring and summer when it is beautiful enough to enjoy a cocktail sitting in the courtyard."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My daughter got married in Alexandria. The Hotel Monaco is in a great location for restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. All of our guests stayed here, and they all raved about it."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",From the moment we pulled in we were treated with personal warmth and we wish we could have booked our whole trip with you. This is not the last time for a Kimpton property.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fantastic experience.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Amazing Hotel. Loved every minute. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Loved the convienence of courtesy shuttle to and from Metro. Hope to go back soon and explore more in Alexandria.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was my second stay and I appreciated this hotel even more than before. The location is perfect and within easy walking distance to everything important. There is also a free trolley stop close by if you need to go further. Free coffee in the am and wine in the pm-who needs anything more! The pool was also great with a lifeguard which you very rarely find. Very upscale feel for the adults and welcoming to kids and dogs as well. It was really great.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My stay was great. I only got to enjoy the hotel for a short time but I plan on staying again when I'm in the area. Good location and helpful staff.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Fun, eclectic hotel. The staff is very helpful, but housekeeping was a bit uneven during my five night stay. Parking is expensive at $25 day, valet and hectic on the very busy King Street.The trade off is that your are in the heart of Old Town and a short walk to the Metro station for trips to D.C."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to make sure we received excellent service. We definitely would stay there again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff was incredible. I had forgotten to pack some things and they were more than happy to replace them for me. The only problem I had was, you have to look very closely to see that it is a hotel when you are walking by or you will pass it. But when I finally found it they gave me a cold wet towel to cool off with."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and me enjoyed a great extended weekend getaway.Located right on King Street, amidst great restaurants, small shops and close to the river front, this hotel was the perfect choice.Friendly staffs, spacious comfortable room ... perfect.We hope to return soon :-)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel right in the center of Old Town Alexandria.  Staff is helpful and the facility is wonderful.  Things are a little pricey in Old Town but it is worth it to stay right there.   There is a Trolley that will take you throughout the area from the Potomac to the King Street Metro Station.   It is also only one stop from Reagan Airport and a great place to walk and shop and eat.   Everything is fabulous!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location is terrific.Check in was fairly easy and quick.Room was nice. I got the 2 double bed room.There were a few quirks however. You have to ask for a separate mini-bar key, which i guess is acceptable and may be more common than i experience. Also, the pool is open odd hours - for example not before 10am on Saturday and Sunday and not between 10 and 2 weekdays, and they actually enforce this by not allowing the doors to open. The fitness equipment all worked, with the exception of the televisions attached to them. Also, TV advertised pay per view, but they must have changed it so it is not available. And finally, internet of course was expensive. i honestly believe i this day and age that wi-fi should be free."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a fantastic hotel. The rooms were very clean and quiet. They accepted our small dog with no fee and we will certainly go back. It was a great location. Very impressed.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We were looking for a fun hotel in an interesting spot to stay in before heading to a wedding in Richmond the following day. Old Town Alexandria sounded like a good bet, and the Hotel Monaco was a great way to stay. The staff was friendly, the room was quiet, and we were given free drinks to compensate for their changing our room type of reservation (which worked just fine for us). We love the funky, yet comfortable, decor of the Kimpton hotels. We'll definitely keep this in our book of places to stay for future D.C. adventures that are not business related."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The location and hotel staff were outstanding. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom clean and well laid-out. The only negative was a musty smell in the bedroom area. Nowhere else in the hotel did I notice this...only room 615.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Bien situ�� au centre d'Alexandria. Accueil parfait. D��coration de chambre est tr��s sympathique.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The inaugural reception for the rewards program was great fun.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel was fine and the staff was actually pretty friendly. They got my reservation wrong, though. I booked a queen single bed and they put me in a room with two double beds. I am a big guy so that makes a difference to me. When I requested that they fix the error, the refused saying that they couldn't because a large group was coming in and had the rooms together. I felt like I was not important to the hotel. I would have went to a different hotel, but it was late and I was very tired. Other than my feet hanging off the bed, the room was nice. I might go back."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Outstanding service and staff began as soon as we stepped into the lobby.  Staff super friendly and courteous.  Super room.  Fantastic room and decore was to die for.  All in all I haven't been so relaxed from a vacation.  I hated to come home!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","so don't book if you hate dogs. Good service, good rooms and great alexadria location"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very solid experience, room good, facilities good. Staff feel a little more impersonal than other Kimpton sites but still, basic service standards are good."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at this hotel with our two cats. The hotel was very accommodating and we had no problem settling in our room. We noticed several  guests with dogs. The only down side was that even though when we first arrived there were no pet smells, by the time we left a few days later, the hallways had a definite dog sent. Not pleasant!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel Monaco is typical of what I've found at every kimpton hotel... Excellent service and willingness to go the extra mile. On this recent trip we spent our five year anniversary with Monaco and they provided champaign and a room upgrade. Just a small example but pretty standard for them. Very clean and a great location.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Monaco! Having lived in Alexandria some years ago, it was fun to go back. Staying at the Hotel Monaco made it even better because we felt like we were in a ""home"" setting yet it was convenient to all the wonderful DC/VA attractions. The staff, the accommodations, the location can't be beat. We hope to do it again some day."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel was very well situated and easy to get to with free parking, free wifi, happy hour and coffee provided at no extra cost. We were also allowed to leave our car parked in their garage after we had checked out"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel staff were wonderful. My only comment was I booked the hotel for it's airport shuttle and I had an early flight. The first shuttle in theirming is not untilv7:Oo am. So I gad to take a cab,"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel in general and room in particular were in very good shape. The staff was well trained and very polite.Breakfast in the hotel was very good. The excercise room is quite small and probably not worth the effort for a short stay.They overdo it with the fragrance in the rooms ...I left the window open to help difuse it.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at the Hotel Monaco Alexandria May 26th through May 31st. I don't even know where to start. When we checked in, the conceriege asked if we were celebrating anything. When I told him it was our anniversary and my parent's 50th anniversary, he immediately went to get us somthing to drink and toast with. He was wonderful-the rooms were wonderful-the lobby was wonderful. Everything was wonderful. Well, almost everything. Our only problem was the air conditioner in my parent's room. When we notified the front desk, my parent's were moved to a new room immediately. I appreciated the speed at which the problem was addressed. The rooms were lovely, so large and roomy. The bathroom was spotless and equipped with great toiletries, hairdryer, and even q-tips and cotton balls! Really fun robes are in all the closets. Free wi-fi, huge flat-screen TV, in-room safe, and a beautiful chaise lounge chair. I loved this hotel. I've never stayed in a place where everyone was so incredibly friendly. The location was excellent-CVS pharmacy on the next block-a great restaurant next door-La Madeline. The King Street Trolley was convenient when we were on King Street but it was not very timely when we were needing it at the King Street Metro-it would finally show up but be prepared for a wait. Overall, we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. This is a first rate establishment and we hated to leave."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is a hip boutique hotel in the Alexandria area. Pleasant staff and nice amenities.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Although the hotel is in a great location, the room was small.....the distance from the elevator to the room was very long....the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the linen and towels are not of superior quality. There were too few bell people or valets for the car...long waits ensued always. the heating/cooling unit is loud."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was simply wonderful. Conveniently located - free shuttle to Metro - 20 minutes to Washington Smithsonian stop. Great little pool with lifeguard. Restaurant was quality food, but a little expensive. Many other restaurants nearby. Overall, I would recommend Hotel Monaco Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From Orbitz I learned and was prepared for the added parking garage charge. When asked about an additional night's stay, I was informed that it would cost me 1 1/2 times what my Orbitz rate was. No thank you. Coffee was only available between 6-9AM in lobby - good thing for Starbucks two doors down. No one offered to help us locate any special services. The one desk clerk was effecient but not friendly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","alexandria is awesome! Hotel Monaco is in a super location. We were not too happy with the fact that the hotel was supposed to have bikes available, I called on the way there to confirm,I asked at check in if we had to reserve them...Oh, they were there and ready. Next morning, we were ready to bike to Mt Vernon, NO BIKES. When I pushed the issue, I was told that they were broken.After some back and forth, 2 bikes appeared,in bad shape with a soon to be flat tire. Free morning coffee is not ready til after 7 and the tea runs out in an hour, you have to request sugar."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",excellent hôtel très bien situé dans une rue très commerçante - restaurants tout autour.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This isna great place in the heart of Old Town Alexandria. The adjoining restaurant is also excellent. I loved the decor of the rooms and also found the pet friendliness of the hotel an added bonus even though I did not bring my dog. Seemed to attract pretty friendly people.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great place to stay if you want a top rated hotel and are not constrained with price. It is right in the middle of Olde Town Alexandria
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lovely couple time.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Normally when traveling to DC with my boss, he prefers to stay in Crystal City since it's closer to where we usually have meetings but I prefer staying in Old Town Alexandria where there are so many pubs, restaurants and shops to walk to when I'm on my time. This time, I chose the Hotel Monaco to stay at and I was very impressed. The hotel was very nice and clean and perfectly situated. I think the only negative I could find is that the valet's weren't very attentive. When I first pulled up to check in before rushing off to a meeting, I couldn't even get the valet's attention to see if I could leave my car there for a minute although I pulled up right next to him as he was having a conversation with a co-worker and I ended up parking on the street around the corner. Other times, the valets also seemed to be too preoccupied to pay attention to their valet lane and for people waiting around to have someone retrieve their cars."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I've often stayed at Kimpton's Monaco across the years, or its edgier sister hotel up King Street, The Lorien. Despite the passage of time, Monaco still shines and can't be beat as a handsome, convenient anchor for exploring King Street and Alexandria's charming residential neighborhoods around the corner. The room decor remains pleasingly quirky, the facilities show not a sign of wear & tear and the staff is, as always, wonderfully hospitable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything was great, from front desk to valet to quality and cleanliness of the room. Quiet yet right in the middle of everything and just blocks from the water. The adjoining restaurant was really good, too. We only had appetizers and a few cocktails but both were solid. Tuna carpaccio was especially good and the oysters were fresh with a great vinegar sauce. A nice night away!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The staff were great. The took the time to get to know my name and said good morning/evening etc everytime they saw me. Loved the personalization.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was a one night getaway for my boyfriend and myself it was very relaxing
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a wonderful stay at The Jefferson. We were there for a wedding, and that evening, the bride and groom's champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were accidentally delivered to our room, but when we called Room Service to inform them of the error, they told us to go ahead and keep them for our trouble and sent the bride and groom a new set. Score! The hotel itself is very impressive: marble columns, plush carpet, beautiful details. Helpful and courteous staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Check in was easy. The hotel was very child friendly. The pool hours were extended for the Spring Break so the kids could enjoy the pool later and they played a movie in the pool area. We had a great trip and would come again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great experience. Will stay again
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","First time stop over in Alexandria on my way back from picking up my daughter from Elon University heading back to Long Island. It's about half way between. Old Town was great, hotel's location was awesome, had the best corn beef and cabbage ever at Daniel O'Connels, although Jackson 20 @ the hotel looked great too - probably the busiest restaurant on all of King St and we were hungry and didn't want to wait. Hotel lobby, hallways, rooms all we impeccable and gave off such a great vibe. You felt privileged to be a guest there. Fabulous place to stay with a dog too. I guess it's pretty obvious that I enjoyed my quick stay here!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was our first time in a Kimpton Hotel - Hotel Monaco is a great hotel within a short walk on King St. to the New Year's Eve fireworks extravaganza on the Potomac in Alexandria, VA. It is a pet friendly hotel - we did not have a pet - so were roomed on a non-pet floor.  However, we could have had a ""goldfish"" if we'd wanted a pet!!!!  They also had a reception in the lobby from 5-6 pm where wines - red, white sparkling were served - don't know if this is a daily event or just because this was New Year's Eve. It was well attended - nice friendly people."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We visited twice in 12 day holiday. My wife fell in love with it and took lots of interior photos. The first visit was after a flight delay and then problems with the GPS/Satnav which meant a five hour total delay. We were given TLC at check in and drinks vouchers for their bar restaurant. The food was good and a really nice Friday night atmosphere in the restaurant. We rushed off early the next morning. The second visit for two nights was also good. We had a room with a balcony which was unusual for the USA and we enjoyed this opportunity to read and relax on the balcony. Another good meal in the restaurant on the second night.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was told at front desk that only 1 floor was not designated for pets, and it was sold out. My room was on the 2nd floor, dog was left alone, barked, scratch on the door for an hour, before we called the front desk. Next day, moved to 3rd, radiator malfunction. Front desk told us that it could not be fixed, no refund, because we did not book with them."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice hotel with a great location. Heating/AC unit in the room was very loud. Pet friendly hotel, don't be surprised when you get on the elevator with a tiny person trying to manhandle a Doberman."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Was there on Business.  The only issue we had is that it is $29 per day to park!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was terrific about this hotel from the cleanliness of the rooms to the very hip feeling ....... even the bar had attracted the best patrons in the area.I highly recommend!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is a nice hotel let down a bit by the standards of service. Rooms are well equipped and designed and very comfortable. We only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as we experienced in our stay.There is a a pool which given that temperatures never fell below 30 during our stay was very welcome at the end of the day. It needs some refurbishment and nowhere to shower before using it!The glass of wine available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but the accompanying nibbles were poorThe staff are friendly and anxious to help but seemed to have limited knowledge of local facilities. An email enquiry prior to arrival went unanswered and I contacted hotel services 3 times during our stay about other things and on each occasion had to chase them up to get an answer.The hotel is situated at the river end of the long King St and is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities. The metro is a good 15 minute walk to the other end of the street and although there is a free shuttle it does not start until 11amWe enjoyed our stay at the hotel and liked it. Alittle bit more attention to detail and it would live up to its own billing
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was a very nice hotel, looked beautiful outside and inside, very clean, very friendly, they had morning coffee in the lobby and in the afternoon wine and tea. The location was awesome, since there is lot's to do in Old Town Alexandria plus it is close to Airport and Washington DC. I will truly recommend it!!! Oh by the way they also had 24 hour Room Service :o)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",2nd stay in a month and it was an easy choice for visits to the greater DC area.  Love it.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Our stay was wonderful. I cannot say enough things about how great the hotel staff were. Comfortable, well decorated rooms. Must love dogs--lots of dogs throughout the hotel and neighborhood"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The room was beautiful, but was a bit cold even with adjusting the thermostat. Most of the staff were very nice and courteous. Hotel decor was great and offered many amenities. The location was nice and there were many restaurants, stores, and other attractions available for one to investigate and enjoy. Check-in and check-out were smooth with no problems. Would definitely stay again, for a longer period of time. Great hotel!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Excellent room. One caveat: Avoid a room on the ""dog park"" side of the hotel. It's really a wide alley between two buildings that's set up with tables and chairs for people to hang out. Lots of barking from their dogs till 8:00 PM. Parking's a bit expensive at $25 in their garage. No vouchers. I asked."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We chose this hotel due to location, and because we had been here previously for one night; we stayed several days this time. Location can't be beat. Room amenities are excellent. Bed was a little hard. Staffers are very nice, but they seem to need more. Front doormen seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving guests but once you got their attention, they could be helpful. If you stay here, you MUST love dogs. The hotel is overrun with guests' dogs who are all generally well-behaved, but they are everywhere. We knew the hotel was dog-friendly but it was rather overwhelming. We will stay here again, but at a time when there are fewer families likely to be traveling (hence, fewer dogs)."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The service staff were fabulous- wine reception held every night in the Libby- excellent location in the heart of old town. Very clean! Great decor!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable and quiet. Parking at hotel is a bit pricey.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is an awesome hotel.  Very convenient to public transportation and the waterfront.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff was amazing.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Had a great time hotel was perfect. Everyone was very nice
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Would stay here everytime while in DC opn business or pleasure
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The weekend we stayed experienced warmer than usual tempertures.  We turned the heat off and it was still too hot in the room.   I guess the air was turned off for the season.  We didn't ask the staff for assistance because we were just too tired to deal with it after spending the day at a family wedding. Luckily, we were able to open the windows and it was much better.  Aside for this issue, the hotel is great, the service is great and the location is fabulous!   I would stay there again on my next visit to VA."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Room was very clean and well appointed. The wine reception each night was wonderful and the wine was very good. Unique place to stay and so easy to commute into DC for sightseeing. Local restaurants were excellent.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel is very nice and walking distance to restaurants, bars and shops. Staff was very helpful as well. Walls are thin so it can be very noisy if people are talking in the hall or their rooms. That said, I would stay there again if I was in Alexandria."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel room was gorgeous! I could not have been happier and can't wait to stay there again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A great place to stay within walking distance of excellent restaurants and fabulous shopping.  The staff is courteous and efficient.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The personnel are quite helpful and they are not understaffed so promptness is also a plus. Location is great with many restaurants within walking distance. I did not eat in the restaurant within the hotel so I cannot comment. Overall a quality hotel in a nice location with very good staff.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a very comfortable hotel in the heart of Old Town Alexandria. Location was perfect, w/i blocks of the Potomac River. The accommodations were wonderful, very relaxing. Great if you are traveling with a pet."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Perfect location for staying in Old Town.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  Easy airport shuttle!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I stayed there for 4 days and found a cockroach in my bed on the pillow...
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice. Staff, room,  and amenities were all excellent."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Bien situé au centre d'Alexandria. Accueil parfait. Décoration de chambre est très sympathique.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We loved it! Very clean,attentive staff and centrally located to everything."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Have visited this site for many years back when it was a Holiday Inn.Kimpton has upgraded and added their delightful touches in decor.The staff is extremely helpful.Very pleased with our stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I recently stayed at your hotel with three of my co-workers. We had a wonderful time. The location of the hotel was perfect for shopping. My only advice would be to avoid the hotel's restaurant for breakfast; it was too pricey and the food was just average.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The room and furnishings were beautiful. Loved the cozy liveliness of the lobby- nice fireplace!  Perfect walking distance to restaurants and waterfront.  We will be back.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Was impressed by the decor, the rooms, the reasonable rates. Was not impressed when my air conditioner iced over and stopped working, and the only way to fix was to turn on the heat to melt the ice. When the ice didn't melt all the way, I was advised simply to turn the air conditioner off. Not really the best solution in D.C.-area heat. The result was a very uncomfortable night. I would make sure the AC unit in your room is working before you stay here -- but otherwise, my stay was lovely."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I have stayed in this hotel 3 years in a row. Everything about this hotel remains consistant, professional,courteous, clean, friendly...I really can't come up with one thing I don't like about it! It's also the closest hotel to Murphy's Irish Pub...they've never met a stranger and I'm comfortable walking there and back to the hotel alone."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The staff are so friendly and the location is perfect for exploring Old Town. I have stayed with my 2 daughters from when they were ages 5 to 11 and they love it as well! It's perfect and fun on the holidays.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Kimpton Hotels are fun places to stay; no two places are a like in decor. But the two I've been to (Hotel Palomar- Wash) and Hotel Monaco had excellent staff service, a nice restaurant, convenience to mass transit and stores."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I am a long-time VA resident and have never had the pleasure of staying here until last Dec 2011. I was pleasantly overwhelmed by the staff, the location, the accomodations, the pool area and the nearby shopping! THANK YOU! I desperately want to come back!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel is fantastic. Clean, well kept, friendly staff, great location really top notch."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was so clean. My wife is a bit of a germ freak and she just loved it. She loved how clean the bathoom was. Didn't see those yellow stained corners in the bathooms! And the towels and bed sheets were actually fresh and clean! I love this hotel!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Room was not ready at 3:00 but they did get a room for us. Told it was no pet floor but there was a dog next door. Guy was smoking on balcony in next room. Otherwise it was a friendly staff and an enjoyable stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The A/C unit in our room was extremely loud. If you get the room next to the swimming pool door, run down stairs and ask to have your room changed."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Friendly hotel in a lovely neighborhood. Some of the ""deluxe"" rooms are small and anything but deluxe. Our first room looked out on a solid brick wall that covered all the windows, making it very dark as well as small."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Interesting location...in the heart of Old Town Alexandria.  Surrounded by shops and restauants.   Wine tasting in the lobby of Hotel.  Restaurant connected to hotel.  Even though dogs are allowed in the hotel, I did not see any inside, nor did I hear any dogs barking.  Excellent Robes.  No refrigerator in room...no coffee machine."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great romantic getaway to the Monaco-second time staying here. Well-appointed, helpful staff, and pet friendly! There was some water damage to a wall in our room which was surprising."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Didn't like the really high Valet Parking, and there was no other parking options that I found available."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and has access to shopping, fine restaurants and other points of interest withing walking distance. There is a free trolley (or free hotel shuttle) to the METRO. What a wonderful place!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The front desk people did not seem very knowledgeable about nearby restaurants or how to navigate and get to see the DC cherry blossoms. One thought he was a comedian -- not very funny after the first 2 minutes.Lots of dogs there (which is nice and welcomed) but I have been to other Kimpton Hotels where the dogs were more welcomed with treats, beds, named greeting. It was nice at Monaco but had better treatment at other Kimpton Hotels."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was awesome that the Hotel offered complimentary bicycles. We had a most enjoyable bike ride to Mt. Vernon.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My children gave me the gift over Thanksgiving of staying at Hotel Monaco, which was lovely . . .with one exception. The staff was excellent: as I am partially disabled, I require certain types of rooms and the hotel accommodated promptly. The room was comfortable and the location of the hotel -- near the center of charming Old Town Alexandria -- could not be better. However, my family and I were disturbed by a race-baiting plaque on the hotel exterior, which we thought very inappropriate for a hotel of the quality of the Monaco. When brought to the attention of the hotel staff, they seemed not to know the history of the plaque."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Purpose of the visit was a conference in National Harbor.  Greeted by a lovely staff who held our bags and got us in to the room in an hour ( way before checkin time!) by calling us at a nearby restaurant.  Plus, we were not part of another large wedding group.  Loved the room: comfortable bed, shower was great, super clean overall!  Location is excellent!  Near shops and lots of restaurants, Starbucks and CVS right out the door.  Not close to metro, so we took cabs to all the sights.  Wine for free everyday for one hour where we met many nice people.  Well behaved dogs are welcome.   Second time with Kimpton, and I decided to join their rewards program.  Outstanding in every way!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","If you are going to stay in quaint Old Town Alexandria, this is the place to stay. They have pet friendly rooms, a morning coffee station in the lobby and wine in the evening. The rooms were immaculate and tastefully decorated.If you are not used to city noises, be sure to request a room that is not on the King street side of the building- a trolley pulls up making electronic announcements of the stops all day/evening long. I was on the third floor and could even hear street conversations as people entered and exited the hotel.The pool and fitness room are nice too. Be sure to make your requests early- I think this hotel is often fully booked. There is another (?smaller) Kimpton hotel around the corner called the Morrison House. It was my first stay in a Kimpton hotel and it was very pleasant."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Directly out of the golden age, this hotel is exquisite in every detail. It is just lovely and comfortable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I enjoyed my stay. The decor was beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the wine hour was really nice!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",excellent h��tel tr��s bien situ�� dans une rue tr��s commer��ante - restaurants tout autour.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The stay was almost perfect. The night we arrived the jet tub didn't work, but everything else was amazing and they had the tub working by the time we wanted to use it again. Highly recommended!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a very nice hotel. It was quiet and comfortable. Althought old and well worn our room was comfortable. What made our stay memorable was the unfailing warmth, courtesy and consideration of the staff. We felt welcomed and cared for our entire stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is very nice, well kept, very clean. The rooms are very comfortable, wifi is good. The area has a lot of restaurants and shops around for taking a walk around the area.If you're in the area, this is a great place to stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel was fun. Great atmosphere for kids and pets but still felt high end. Biggest problem was lots of noise, both from street and from passersby in hallway."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The only issues wereloud heating mechanism. room service was a little slow for breakfast.I liked the room decoration and the bed was very comfortable.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had asked for a quiet room, far from elevators. This was indeed far from the elevators. The room was small compared to one we had previously and not with the view on the street (which was part of the description when we booked). The view was terrible outside. More importantly, the heating A/C system was super loud and it will wake you up each time it will start again. We were so tired in the morning. The shower was warm and not hot. The staff was quite efficient but ""cold"". Altogether, quite disappointing."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The King Street location was excellent for getting to all the sites you would like to visit in D.C. Blocks away from the Potomac. Free trolley brings you to the metro station. Can't ask for a better location.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We stayed for 2 nights and loved our room and location of the hotel. Room had a colonial feel and was roomy. Hotel is right on King st in old town Alexandria. Surrounded by cute shops and easy access to the trolly which goes to the metro. Can't wait to stay again!

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel offers a great set of features for visits to Alexandria:-> Great location on King Street, walkable from there to everywhere in Old Town-> Great service - entire staff of hotel very friendly throughout-> Nice rooms - comfortable beds, dimmers on all light switches including in the bathroom to adjust the lighting as you like-> Dog friendly - if you're traveling with a dog, this place is very dog friendly, including dog amenities at checkin-> Evening cocktail hour in lobby - very friendly buzz-> Parking garage below hotel - very convenient-> Very reasonable rates for the quality of the experienceIn sum: a real gem of a place!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We went to Old Town Alexandria, VA for a short getaway between Christmas and New Years. Had a great time! Hotel Monaco was awesome! We enjoyed the decor, and Christmas decorations. The Jackson 20 restaurant was also excellent. We had the best duck dish anywhere (better than Chinatown 0 San Francisco!). Except for a little confusion with our room service breakfast order, everything else went great. The staff are particularly welcoming and friendly, from the front desk, to the valet, bellman, and the waiter. Just terrific! We live about 2 hours away, so we'll be back for more visits for sure!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Me and my family enjoed the stay and wish very soon to go back
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was good. the hotel is in a good location, good staff. I have stayed there before"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Nice boutique hotel in the heart of Alexandria. Good change from all the ""run of the mill"" chain hotels. Location was perfect with many choices for Dining, Shopping or just taking a stroll in the evening."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Only four for cleanliness as shower needs to be hit with a couple of squirts of bleach along the edges and in the corners. Otherwise a great stay!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The Old Town Hotel--a former Holiday Inn--is undergoing extensive renovations. It still has a great location about four blocks from the river, and the prices are reasonable, but restaurant is closed, only one elevator is operating--I'd wait."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Free coffee service in the morning and a wine happy hour were both nice amenities.  Parking a bit of a problem.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed one night and the location was excellent to all things old town Alexandria.  Overnight parking across the street in public parking was $15 compared to the hotel's valet of $27 or $29, so I recommend parking in the Courthouse garage.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great brunch onsite."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The air wasnt working well.I had to ask three times for them to come to the room,and work on it. It was very hot like 92 outside."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",You can't beat Hotel Monaco for a night in Alexandria. Great hotel in a great location!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff at the desk were incredibly helpful and pleasant.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This was a short & first visit for my husband & I to Old Town. Hotel Monaco was a great choice! The room though small was ample. Front desk and all employees very friendly and helpful. The wine tasting happy hour was great! Location was perfect. We took other reviewers advice and used the parking garage across the street which was half the cost. And the lobby morning coffee was very good too!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Tolles Zimmer, nettes Personal"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Lovely Hotel. Shuttle service only goes to Regan Airport not Dullas, we had some confusion, but the staff made it up to me. I would stay there again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel staff was very polite and the hotel exceptionally well cleaned and maintained. The location is a real plus with a diverse choice of breakfast, lunch and dinner options as well as shopping and entertainment."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location and lots of restaurants nearby.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Room in excellant condition and perfectly cleam. Excellant location. The breakfeast is a little bit pricy and does not offer many choices
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Good spot
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Easy to book; price dropped from time of booking to arrival date. Submitted claim and Expedia credited difference.Hotel was excellent. Great location; terrific accommodations; wine service at happy hour is a nice touch prior to dinner plans.Would definitely stay again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Friends wedding
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Really enjoyed this conveniently located hotel on arguably the best street in Alexandria.It might not be as close to the Metro as some of the big name hotels but being closer to the waterfront was nice and there's a bevy of fine dining, pubs and such to keep the entire family happy."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Clean room.  Lobby was great, and restaurant was outstanding."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Conveniently located in old town alexandria.  Style, comfortt, excellent service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel location is great and within walking distance to everything. The service was not up to what is expected for a Monaco hotel. When we arrived, it was raining and we had to wait out by our car for the valet and bellboy to come out. They weren't busy at all; they were just standing around. On several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. Honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. The room was nice but not very big."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We found the hotel staff very friendly and quick to respond. However, the morning wait staff in the dining room (Jackson 20)was generally slow and unattentive. The exception was the hostess."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We spent three nights here and loved the locale and the room but were challenged by the lack of 'in room' tea and coffee facilities. When we asked reception they sent us up a filter coffee machine which made terrible coffee. Only a minor point but would have added to our experience to be able to make a cup of tea.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",It was a typical Kimpton hotel - classy and chic
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Quaint lovely stay, in an old brick and cobllestone neighborhood. I enoyed my stay with the indoor pool and 24 hour gym. Evening wine reception was a treat. (The room is a bit small and there is no jacuzzi) but we survived by the old French decor and amenities. Plenty of eateries to choose from and affordable."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Internet and self park will charge 27$.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Business. Good spot for meetibgs. Monique and front desk staff were fabulous.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From the first moment, things went very smoothly.  We were upgraded to a suite that was very lovely! Unexpected, and very welcome!  The room was clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable.  We stayed 2 nights.  They have a wine hour with complimentary white or red wine in the lobby.  We would definitely stay again!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My overall experience was very pleasant! Loved the room decor and cleanliness. Didn't care for the service of restaurant attached and my son and I ended up leaving after no server for 15 minutes with less than 5 other patrons noted. The construction downstairs resumed in the evening however it did not affect us while we were in our room. I would stay there again!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Really nice, updated and clean. Would definitely stay again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a nice hotel in that the decor is nice, the bathroom and beds are nice and they have free wine every night.  We found the service and management pretty bad.  The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Typical brick exterior in Old Town Alexandria, hides a warm inviting lobby with a fireplace, a deep turquoise blue and nicely appointed.  Friendly staff greeted me at the door, as well as at the front desk, where I was treated to drinks in the bar.  The d��cor is a bit busy, but fun.  My room was on a nice courtyard, which was closed for the winter.  I loved the d��cor, finish, appointment and comfort of the room.  Bed was super nice, bathroom, spacious and marble throughout.  Went to the bar for a night cap the first night, and a lively bar scene of patrons in their 30's to 60's, bartender made my custom drink, and I, being alone, enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, trying to stay off my phone, except to check the hockey scores.  Parking garage in the basement was key and convenient.  There was a pool, but I was a bit disappointed there was not a hot tub.  Other than that minor disappointment, the staff was super helpful and polite."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I come back here over and over... Because of its perfect location, style, nice staff and cleanliness. Cabs waiting in front of the hotel at all times. Walking distance to all shops and restaurants, the river and the boats.One thing that puzzles me in ALL hotels, not only this one is there will never be enough (sometimes even none) soaps, shampoo bottles and sometimes even towels for the number of guests the room is booked for-could it be because they want to save them, or because they want you to call and you have to tip the person that brings them?!Another thing-no morning newspaper on the date you are checking out. Not biggies - I would not change a hotel because of the above but too petty and goes against hospitality rules."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",My favorite and only place I stay when I return to my home town for a visit.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice roomPerfect locationNice staffGreat bar
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Wonderful! Highly recommend. Decor is a bit odd, but it works."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco is located in Old Town, Alexandria which is an amazing neighborhood full of many options for dining and shopping. My boyfriend and I stayed here for our two-year anniversary and I actually preferred the time we spent in Old Town close to our hotel, rather than the time we spent sightseeing. I can't say enough about what a great neighborhood the hotel is in. We stayed in a corner room with a king bed. The room felt much larger than your average hotel room and the decor is very unique. We valet parked our car in the underground garage for two days, which seemed easier than attempting to find parking in the busy neighborhood."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is located in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, a block west of the main square and about 4 blocks (maybe a 5 minute walk) from the marina. We booked our room here based on the high ratings and positive reviews on Hotels.com and other sites. This hotel definitely deserves its aplomb! Its decor is unique and we really liked the look. The king room we had on the fifth floor was very clean and comfortable, and the common areas of the hotel were well maintained and also clean. Although we didn't have the kids with us on this stay, the hotel seemed very kid-friendly. We'll definitely stay here next time we're in the area."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The location was perfect. The metro was a little ways up king street but u could take the free trolley although we enjoyed the walk. Staff was very friendly. We really enjoyed the wine happy hour.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The Bellmen were extremely friendly and acted like they enjoyed their job. Hotel was beautiful. Across from a french bakery and an irish pub - both with outdoor seating. A great break from the hustle of Washington DC.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We had a lovely stay, Location is great and staff especially friendly and helpful. Two tiny observations that might help them make everything even better. One, there were no towel rods near the sink, nowhere to put a handtowel. Also, unlike every hotel I've stayed in, there was no shower cap.Initially I was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel would show signs of pet hair, noise or other things a non-pet family might not tolerate. But the worse things I saw were some very cute dogs behaving extraordinarily well! Definitely not a problem."

"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",very nice boutique hotel and great location. Rooms very cute
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Outstanding overall. We felt welcome as a family with a small child even though most guests were on business. Very gracious service.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Hotel says free airport shuttle but it should note the Shuttle is only to and from Reagan National not Dulles.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We stayes at the Monaco as we were running the George Washington Parkway Classic. Perfect location. Hotel was very clean and decorated nice. Comfortable bed. Staff was nice. Only bad part was they said the garage was full and we had to pay $27 to park our car for less than 24 hours. Would definitely stay there again though.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fun wine hour in the lobby..comfy robes..well working bathroom..nice shampoo and soaps.location was good if you like the busy times of old town. Quite a long walk to metro.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We had a fabulous week. The wine reception is a special touch and we were able to meet a lot of interesting people during it. Employees go out of their way to be nice. Very clean and well maintained. Perfect location near wonderful restraurants and shops. Very safe.E
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Loved it. I'd never been to the area before, and the staff were quite helpful and friendly. The hotel is lovely."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I've stayed a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay. However, during my most recent stay the A/C wasnt working so I called for service...no one ever showed up and finally at 10pm with a meeting in the morning I went to bed- uncomforatble! Very dissapointed!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Would definitely stay again. We really enjoyed the personable staff and the very clean rooms, very impressed on how ""pet-friendly"" everyone was"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Magnifique h��tel, id��alement situ�� dans la ville d'Alexandria, proche de Washington !Personnel tr��s accueillant, chambre et sale de bain tr��s propre et tr��s bien d��cor��.Nombreux restaurants �� quelques m��tres de l�� (restaurant de l'hotel assez cher).Piscine et sale de sport �� disposition.Une adresse �� ne pas rater !"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice..walls are thin, however..Nice courtyard"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was greeted very warmly and since I had a late check in I also was greeted with a complementary glass of wine. The staff helped me to my room, held open doors, suggested great local restaurants and were generally awesome."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My wife and I are always on the lookout for pet friendly hotels, but most often end up staying in poor off-highway motels. The Hotel Alexandria by Kimpton could not be further from that. It's a luxe joint that allows dogs of all sizes for free. The bed puts the Westin Dream bed to shame. There's complimentary wine happy hour with snacks. A gorgeous pool. The list goes on. You owe it to yourself to stay here!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The only problem is that the hotel and everything on King street is very expensive.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","When we get there with the door man, with the name Majid!, was pretty reluctant to bring out the cart and help us with the luggage. Finally, he dragged out the cart and stood there till I filled out the cart. He pushed the cart inside and stood there (like he is waiting for tip, which he did not desrve). I gave him my $2 and he looked as me as if he is just done saving my life through a critical heart surgery and that I am such a jerk I only paid him 2 dollars. He walked away without even saying ""Thank you!"". Also a night before our departure, we came to an uncleaned room at 5 pm (we left before 9 am for sight seeing and came back super tired), and when I called the front desk, he asked me ""do you want it to be cleaned?!"", Me: ""...of course"", and the response was ""no problem, I send someone to clean the room!"", not even an ""I am sorry!"". We have to hang outside in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Staff amazing, every single one of them pleasant, eager to please, and make each guest feel special"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Swimming pool was not available otherwise it would be a 5
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is an interesting hotel in a great location with lots of restaurnts, shops, and attractions within an easy walk.  Although we didn't have our dog with us, we were pleased to see it was pet-friendly, including having pet sitters available."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","First class establishment. Nice bed, towels, robes. Friendly, helpful staff."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Have stayed here before and chose to return. The wine hour is always well attended.I went to the pool. While it is beautiful--it is way dark up there. More lights would be helpfulMy shower/tub faucet was a little cantankerous, but engineering showed up immediately to fix it."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very enjoyable stay. Quiet room and reasonable parking.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was impressed with the staff at this hotel, very pleasant and helpful, very personable. My room was quiet, spacious, had a nice veiw, the decor was out of the ordinary for hotels which was nice and the TV was a large widescreen HD set. But perhaps the best part about this hotel is the surronding area of old town Alexandria, VA.  A very neat and interesting place, the locals were very friendly, the shops were cool, it was clean and had very easy access to the subway."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","From its eclectic d��cor to its impeccable service, the Monaco offers a fantastic getaway in the heart of old town Alexandria. I stayed for a Birthday weekend & had a wonderful time. The bedding was incredibly comfortable, the amenities were well appointed, & the service was excellent. I highly recommend the Monaco."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","If you are looking to stay at a location other than Washington, D.C., Alexandria and this hotel are an excellent option."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I loved this hotel. The room was cozy and comfortable. I also like that the Kimpton company is concerned with the greater good of the world and a conscientous business partner based on its list of giving and affiliatiations located in the room guest book. A Great place to stay!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",BEAUTIFUL HOTEL ROOM. VERY COMFORTABLE BEDS. CLOSE TO EVERYTHING.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Everything was great about our stay, however, the parking situation wasn't the best due to the fact that we had to pay for parking. There was a charge for both self park and valet. Don't get me wrong, the valet service and staff were top notch, but the fact that we had a vehicle, there is a charge to park either way. Limited parking is always understandable, but the fee was unexpected. Great service and great stay, but if you have a vehicle you will have to pay for parking."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice hotel with a European character. I was pleasantly surprised that the wallet parking was half price because we came in a hybrid car.Lots of nice places nearby to eat. Not to far Metro to get into Washington DC. There is a free shuttle that runs up and down King St in case you don't want to walk.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I thought the hotel was beautiful. It is a very nice place to stay for younger people or people who do not have children. I say this because the surrounding area is really just filled with shops, bars and restaurants. There are no real attractions or things for children to do. Having children there was okay as the hotel does provide a children's time. If a person goes to DC to visit the Mall and the museums, I would suggest they stay closer to those attractions. Other than that, the area is beautiful and the restaurants were nice and the hotel was great. My only complaint of the hotel was there was a faint scent of urine at the door."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This place is a first class act! All of the staff are friendly and courteous, particularly Kayla at the front desk lobby who is ready and willing to eagerly assist you with any questions you may have! Great downtown location in historic area, large comfortable rooms, bedding, and bathroom! A magnificent mini-bar in your room which is nearly a mini market! And additionally an equally wonderful reastaurant, with an equally wonderful and attentive staff! Joined the rewards stay program, and definitely intend to stay again! Highly recommend!!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","They run a good show, and the staff are outstanding.  The only complaints I have are that the bar and restaurant are ridiculously overpriced ($8 for single shot of liquor) and the rooms are decorated in a art deco sort of bizarro fashion.  Leopard robe in the closet, stetch chair from the 20's in the room, star-shaped mirrors.  Just weird.  But the hotel itself is first class and I highly recommend it."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The door was paper thin and I could hear the ice machine and everything being said in the hallway. It was not relaxing. The location is perfect for walking around.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was wonderful from the frontdesk and valets to the beautiful rooms and lobby. The only problem we had was our room had a A/C problem two nights in a row. So the second night they moved us to a larger room down the hall for the last two nights of our stay! If you decide to go just remember there is a overnight parking fee for each night your car is parked on their property.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The service was excellent.  The free wine hour in the afternoon was lovely.  The hotel staff well trained and efficient.  I was there for a family wedding and many of the guests stayed here.It is within walking distance of dozens of ethnic restaurants,shops and the famous Torpedo Factory( where the weddiing was held).The room was large and had windows that opened. The bathroom was large as well and immaculate.It was a delightful experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I highly recommend this hotel. Great location!!!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holidays while visiting family. Really enjoyed the amenities surrounding this location (restaurants nearby, CVS across the street). There was an underground parking garage, which was helpful. All rooms are well maintained. The gym was a little small (only 2 treadmills). The free coffee in the mornings and wine in the evening was great!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fun place. Bustling area.  Free shuttle to airport.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great hotel within walking distance of excellent restaurants, shops, and Nationals Ball Park (about 12 City blocks to Metro, but with all the good food there, it was a necessity to walk!). Could not ask for anything more!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Long story short: this place needs time to settle and find it's new identity. Staff are either unhappy with the change from Kimpton to Marriott or just not well-trained. Service no longer as pleasant, some staff lacking common sense/professionalism, and food no longer worth it. Also missing amenities that made the hotel much more enjoyable. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The staff here was exceptionally friendly from the moment I arrived.  The room decor was so cute, funky and modern--I absolutely loved it.  The room was very spacious and so was the bathroom.  The bed was so HUGE and comfortable and I loved the swiveling flat screen tv so I could watch it while in bed or swivel it to watch while on the computer at the desk.  The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the air conditioner was leaking a bit so the floor was wet around it, but it still worked perfectly so that minor flaw didn't matter to me."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We stayed at this hotel because of the small town, old fashioned atmosphere.  It was a very slow paced town with lots of fun things to see and do.  We were in town to see the sights of Washington DC but found just as many fun things to do in Alexandria.  The hotel staff was very helpful and prompt with any request that we had, from leaving us more towels to getting our car from parking. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone who is looking for a very nice place to stay in the DC area."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I have two observations: We arrived late, 11:30 PM and immediately ordered room servece. The food finally arrived at about 1AM. During the wait I called several times and ended up having words with the people at the front desk. I used the mini bar every day and kept a running tally of everything we drank. At check out time there was a big discrepancy but I was able to settle it with the front desk. All thinghs considered,we would definitely go back"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great location on king street - easy walk to the river (even with a 3 and 5 year old). Staff went out of their way to engage the kids - the pool with lifeguard was a nice touch. Will be back!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very nice room. 1/2 price parking for hybrids. Only downsides: no Blu-ray or DVD players in the room, front desk had no more available by 8 PM. TV was on the low end on processing power for HD channels. Pretty slim selection of channels and movies on offer. Otherwise a comfortable and beautiful room."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Location, quality of the hotel, and value for the cost"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The usual quirky Kimpton decor, comfort and amenities in a great location. But we had the worst service we've had in a long time in the restaurant. Ultra-long waits to order and between courses, and a Hostess who apologized for the server but did nothing to help speed things up."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel Monaco boasts a great location in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, close to a wealth of shops and restaurants. Beautifully done - a very memorable hotel experience!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel. Old refurbished and remodeled. Nicely done. Only gripe is the ac units are inside the room and extremely noisy..
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Right in the heart of old town.But, no hot water on one day of my stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","After reading some reviews of the hotel, I expected a traditional 'old world style' matching the area of King Street.The room was very clean, with updated amenities and a staff that was very accommodating and pleasant.  I would certainly recommend the hotel even for a longer stay. Transportation and the variety of dining choices were all in close proximity, easy access for any traveler."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very comfortable kingsize bed in a clean, stylish room - recently renovated. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Received good information from the concierge. Valet parking. Situated in close proximity to the waterfront, shopping, good restuarants, free local tram car which takes you to the Metro. Provided free transportation to Ronald Reagan Airport on our departure. The restaurant, though not inexpensive, was very good. Didn't use the exercise facility or the pool."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",We traveled to Alexandria for a weekend getaway and had a wonderful time at this hotel. Located on Duke street so your right in the heart of Old Town. This hotel is very well maintained and the staff is wonderful. The daily wine reception is a great way to relax and meet your fellow travelers.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Attentive staff, excellent food and services.  Lobby area is very inviting, great to sit in and watch the comings and goings"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Stayed in the hotel to be close for the George Washington Parkway Ten Mile Classic. Great location and room.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff was very friendly and helpful without seeming fake.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I am from old town, and I stayed in this hotel with my mom on her visit.  It had been under renovations for over a year or so, and I was really excited to see what they had done.  It was a beautiful room, view, location.  The decorating is eclectic in a very modern way, but there is still an ""old world"" kind of feel.  The amenities were great (the shower was fantastic, love the hardware!), and the concierge helped us with everything.  It is the only hotel in Old Town with a doorman.  I would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  The restaurant downstairs (Jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.  I can't wait to go there when it warms up to take advantage of the courtyard and balconies."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved it. Totally divine. Great decor. Everything I needed and more. Just charging to print in the business centre seemed a liitle tight.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent service!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Everything was great until we discovered ants in out room. The Hotel handled it in a professional manor Anne we were promptly moved to another room.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The hotel itself is lovely. However, room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to arrive. The first day, no one came to clean until 6pm. A try of food from that 2 hour wait sat in the hall for 28 hours- along with other trays. Twice- service personal quietly locked on the door and then walked in before I could even ask who was there. On the third day, the room was cleaned but they did not actually close the door so my room and valuables were left exposed and vulnerable to theft- which is concerning when you realize that you can walk off the street into the underground garage and go into the elevator with no key and no one seeing you and straight to the hotel room floors. There are other small things but these were the big issues. I stay in hotels a lot- this is the first time I felt it really important to write a negative review."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was the BEST Hotel we ever stayed in. The staff was very attentive to your ever need. Within the hour after arriving the doorman ""Eddie"" will remember our name and always anticipated your request. They are very familiar with all of the entertainment and places to eat in the area. IWe actually did not want to checkout.   The room is like being in heaven."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Nice ambiance and very comfortable beds. The staff was pleasant in person and over the phone. There was coffee in the morning at the lobby and wine in the afternoons/evenings ... all on the house.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Loved the location! Close to cute shops and restaurants. The room was great, and especially loved the animal print robes!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and facilities of the hotel. It definitely earns the 4.5+ rating. Great location and walking distance to restaurants.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very pleasant stay, gorgeous rooms and great staff"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Very classy, comfortable hotel with beautiful decor."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",only one night stay.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My husband and I spent our anniversary weekend at this hotel, as we do every year. However, this time around was not our usual pleasant experience. We had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. The parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. At one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. I will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. Later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. Needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend. Great hotel and staff otherwise. Don't know that we will be returning again though!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location within walking distance of the party we were attending. Can be pricey depending on what is going on in the area. Also, there is an additional charge for wifi and parking. The best thing was the wine happy hour and the free Sunday NYT."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",very comfy bed...extremely convieniant in olde town. not far from airport
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was great. I enjoyed the farmers markets and the variety of stores and restaurants in the area. The room was big but the TV had static all day and we were unable to utilize it. Unfortunately, I was not able to be accommodated for an extended stay."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was terrific. I had been in Alexanderia may times but it was great to be staying in such a nice hotel right in the middle of Old Town.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",needs more lighting in bathroom- AC needs upgrade- power outage of entire hotel for 12 hours -hotel had excellent service even during power outage-very professional rooms new well decorated staff attentive and very courteous
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I was surprised to learn that there was a separate charge for parking, but I probably didn't read the description fully.  It was valet parking only.  The room air conditioner was wonderfully cold, but quite noisy.  However, it was sort of white noise because we didn't hear the street sounds.  Requested additional bath towels; no problem."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I miss the Kimpton, no more wine, minibar, or breakfast. My hotel room took three different trips to the front counter to get a working key. During my last stay I had a individual walk in my room at 0200 in the morning, hotel told the police that sometimes the doors do not close and lock properly, please check your doors. This use to be my go to hotel when I stay in DC, I am now staying elsewhere."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I booked the room for myself and a friend for her birthday celebration. The room was very comfortable for the few hours in which we were present. The front desk staff and valet's were very friendly and helpful. One tip...the adjacent restaurant (Jackson 20) was introduced to us as a place to get brunch the next day. We were looking forward to that, however when we approached the hostess for a table we were told that all tables were saved for those with reservations. It would have been nice to have been told that reservations were needed during our check-in process. Even better, front desk staff should offer to make those reservations for hotel guests."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I brought my sister and kids from Orlando to Alexandria and wanted them to have a lovely, comfortable and elegant experience.  So, I purposely chose Hotel Monaco given the wonderful d��cor, reminiscent of 1930s or 40s ""old Hollywood"", classic elegance, amenities, shopping and restaurants on King Street, high ratings, and affordable price.  The front desk staff was amazing, very gracious and personable.  When we needed extra bedding for the room, the staff responded right away.  Everyone was wonderfully gracious and kind.  We enjoyed shopping and dining on King Street, and we also took the King Street Trolley to the Metro Station for sightseeing in DC!  We enjoyed visiting the Smithsonian museums, the National Mall, the White House and Lincoln Memorial. My family was thrilled and said this was the most beautiful hotel they had every stayed in!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",service was very good. the tub was not draining but they did fix it for us after offering another room. the pet goldfish they brought for the kids was a nice touch and the wine hour for mom and dad was great!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Trip to Old Town, Alexandria, VA included business and pleasure. The Hotel Monaco is perfectly situated in Alexandria-access to restaurants, trolley, historical houses. In addition, the staff of the hotel is friendly and so willing to be helpful. Bicycles are available to borrow and the pool is nice. Rooms are very comfortable. Highly recommend for anyone visiting VA and DC."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel used to serve wine. No longer. No more words to write about
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Hotel staff was very friendly. Location is perfect - close to everything. Two negatives - the hotel shuttle failed to show up. The front desk assured me this was an unusual occurrence and offered to pay my cab fare. This was a bad start to an otherwise great visit. The other negative - no coffee maker in the room. This is tough for a person who can't start up without caffeine. Coffee is served in the lobby at around 6:15AM for those who want to ""sleep in""."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Excellent value for quality accommodations in charming setting.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",This is a great hotel for a honeymoon. My wife and I stayed their for 1 night. The Hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen. Housekeeping woke us up not once but twice. Once at 8am and next at 10am. Checkout is at 12pm but since they were so concerned we decided to checkout by 10:30am. To make matters even worse the vallet brought my car up front but wasn't there to give me the key as I stood out in the cold for 10 minutes. Not a good experience.P.S. Don't count on room service to be having a great meal as the menu suggests.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My stay was good not excellent due to the temperature of the room. Those days that I stay the ambient temperature was 18 degree my room remain 68 to 70. My room was cold. The technician came did something and said I'll call back in 30 minutes, he never call nor never return, the room remain cold. This is a 4 star hotel I should not be going thru this inconvenience for an expensive room, I had to reduce my stay. Bad experience."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lovely hotel but noisy air conditioner
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel is not worthy of the limp Tom name. The staff was very nice but it stops there. I booked this hotel because it has a 4.5 rating and is a VIP + hotel on Expedia. It's a 3 star hotel at best and never once did I get a VIP treatment. To the contrary I think that since I booked through Expedia they have me the worst possible room in the entire hotel. Room was like a Marriott room which is fine but nothing special. It was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly. It was not prepared for my arrival and there was some kind of leak so an entire section of carpet was soaking wet. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. I am also beginning to think that booking hotels through Expedia is a bad idea because I always get treated worse if I do. I'm a gold member w Expedia and I always get shafted when I book with them. This is the third time in a row I've had to complain to Expedia about their ""partner"" hotels."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I have stayed at six Kimpton Hotels and I have come to expect an outstanding level of service above and beyond a typical hotel. The Hotel Monaco did not live up to the level of service I expected. When the shuttle dropped me off at the curbside of the hotel, no one helped with the luggage or even held the door open; this was 2pm in the afternoon. The desk clerks were short and not forthcoming with information about the area. When you are in town for only 24 hours, my time in town is precious and I would expect them to volunteer helpful information for a tourist. Then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and the driver had the music on loud while another passenger and myself were trying to have a conversation and he drove like a maniac. Very disappointed."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the DC area. Not only was the staff friendly, the hotel lovely, and the room comfortable, it was located walking distance to amazing dining and shopping."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Would love to stay again!!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Staff couldn't be more helpful or friendlier. Wine reception is very nice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved everything. Would come here again.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Marble bathrooms, coffee and tea, great restaurant, quiet...I could not love this hotel more.  And it is three short blocks to the river where there is an awesome walking/running path.  Tons of restaurants and shops right outside the door and a drug store.  Seriously it is awesome!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel should've been better prepared for the icy conditions outside. It took them a while to get icemelt down.  Extremely unsafe for patrons to walk outside the hotel
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We truly enjoyed out stay. The staff was very helpful and the location was perfect for catching a show at the Birchmere, shopping, a mini spa day and waterfront sight seeing."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Lobby staff were very helpful.  Room service needed to be contacted on the 3rd day to replace towels.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Myself and 15 yo and 10 yo granddaughters came for a short 3 niter to visit Washington, DC. My husband recommended staying in Alexandria. The hotel was 1st rate in comfort and design. The people could not have been nicer. We were close to the Metro, a free trolley and many restaurants and shopping. Except for the heat and humidity outside, the trip was fantastic."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel! One disappointment was we were traveling with children and the pool was broken.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Very nice hotel.Great Location.This will be our new hotel to stay at when we are in VA
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My husband and I, along with another couple, really enjoyed our stay at the Alexandria Monaco. We were there for a full weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel staff made it very welcoming for us by providing champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. We upgraded our room to one with a terrace, which was nice because it was a large room, and we got to see another wedding in the courtyard. The front door of the hotel is right on King Street, which was always busy with people walking around. The hotel is within walking distance of so many things. There are several cafes and small restaurants nearby. Parking is reasonable compared to other parking garages in and around the DC area. We would definitely go back to this Kimpton property."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great terrace with view of courtyard
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Loved this hotel. Such a treat and felt totally spoiled.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","the hotel Monaco was a great experience. I cannot say the same for hotels.com. when I landed at the airport and contacted the hotel, they did not have my reservation, even though I had a reservation through your service. it was clear to me there was a communication breakdown at hotels.com and I should have been notified of any issues in advance. I will likely not be using hotels.com again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",fantastic. Very pet friendly and an awesome happy hour
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Fun hotel atmosphere and in a fantastic location for shopping and great restaurants!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was centrally located and very dog friendly. We enjoyed our time. Although we had some issues with our room, they were fixed quickly."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","In a pinch after a cancelled flight. Was able to find this hotel. I had never been to Alexandria, but Old Town is a beautiful, great neighborhood. Lots of restaurant choices. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. A great stay overall."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",As always it was wonderful. My family and I are repeat visitors. We travel to Alexandria every year and prefer the Monaco above any other hotel.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Can't say enough nice things about this hotel - the staff is helpful and friendly, the location can't be beat, and it's just an appealing, quirky (in a good way), comfortable place. We're big fans of the pool and the daily wine reception in the (really attractive & cozy) lobby. Even the price is competitive for the great location (literally a short walk to just about everything) and the level of service."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This was by far one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff was extremely curtious and went out of their way to help me in whatever I desired. The location is in Old Towne Alexandria by many shops and wonderful restaurants. The room was cozy, exquisite and spectacularly clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone on business or just traveling for leisure as it is what a hotel stay should be."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel with great service and near so many cool places.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","The area of old town is awesome and very romantic. My girlfriend loved the area, water, restaurants, and shops. The hotel was beautiful . Room was very clean and the design was top notch . Definitely would come back to the hotel . Front seat service was top notch , 5 star bath room and amenities"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","My roommate and I are from NYC and were coming down to DC/Alexandria for a wedding and we picked this hotel because it was 2 blocks from the wedding location. I wish we had had more time to take advantage of all the hotel had to offer. It was an incredibly comfortable hotel room and the service was always friendly. My roommate needed a lint roller and she called guest services and while they didn't have a lint roller, they tried their best to solve her problem and brought her a roll of scotch tape. We had some drinks and appetizers at the hotel restaurant (jackson 20? jackson #), and the drinks were fun and delicious, as was the cheese and meat plate (I can't spell the fancy word for meat plate--charcuterie?). While it didn't wake me up or keep me up, once I was awake, I did notice that the sound from the hallway was very easy to hear through the door as we were right across from the elevator, but it was not an inconvenience to me, and the rest of our stay was very quiet and private."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We very much appreciated the welcome note and complimentary wine and treats in honor of our anniversary. The hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful. And the hotel is very conveniently located. But if we'd known that this place was going to be overrun with dogs, we'd have booked in somewhere else, like the sister property Lorien (where we've enjoyed staying before). You really should highlight to potential guests that dogs and cats are allowed at this property, so those of us who have allergies or just don't enjoy having animals up close and personal can have advance notice of the situation here. At least give patrons the option of booking a pet-free room!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Great hotel / outstanding location. Only suggestions would be (1) have stayed there many times - coffee in lobby should be hotter (2) could use a second chair in room beside desk chair (3) parking costs are exorbitant
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Restful, great location, multiple dinning and shopping options surrounding hotel. Lobby coffee in the morning and hot chocolate in the evening were nice touches."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We have stayed here before and we have always loved this place. They do a lot of complimentary little events like wine tastings in the evenings, and free coffee and hot chocolate in the mornings.This was our first time visiting with our dog and they were great! We will make this our annual place to go right before the holidays! a fantastic way to explore Old Town all within walking distance."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This hotel was the BEST!!!  It was in the center of Old Town and we were able to walk around town and to the metro with no problems at all.  With its great location there isn't anywhere you can't go in just a few minutes, including shopping and restaurants.  The hotel was just renovated and it is beautiful.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  The housekeeping staff was very polite and apologized if the towel cart was even a little bit in the way.  We will definitely stay here again."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","This is a delightful hotel -- classy and comfortable.  Two things stand out:  the room was wonderful with lots of space, a comfy bed, a chaise lounge, great desk area, lots of lighting, and nice bathroom (room's only negative:  noisy air conditioner), and the hotel staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful.  While the other Alexandria hotels are 15 blocks away (near the Metro station), this hotel is right in the middle of the historic district, close to great restaurants and shops, the Torpedo Art Center, and the riverfront.  We used the free trolley to ride to the Metro (short taxi ride in the am before the trolley begins service at 11:30 am) and the hotel's free shuttle to return to Reagan National airport.  This hotel convinved me:  I will ldefinitely ook for Kimpton hotels in the future!"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","Great location, nice amenities, amazing service!  When we checked in we were greated by [...] at the desk.  He asked what brought us to the Monaco.  We were there for our 29th Wedding Anniversary.  We checked into the room, then went for a walk in Old Town.  Upon our return we were pleasantly surprised to find a bucket of beer on ice, a large bowl of chips with salsa and a nice card from [...] wishing us a happy anniversary!!  He also gave us 2 gift cards for free wine in their restaurant.  The valet staff were helpful and pleasant.  They suggested an umbrella due to impending rain (an umbrella was in our room).  It did indeed rain. If there was a negative... it was being charged parking while staying there.  Overall, very enjoyable and would definitely recommend.  (BTW -- if you have dogs, they cater to them - BIG TIME.)"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We love Alexandria, and the Monaco hotel fits all our needs."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","It was a quick trip to visit relatives, so we did not use all of the services. The staff was friendly and helpful. Having parking, including valet parking available in Alexandria was a real plus. It is convenient to other transportation if we had wanted to see the sights. We were disappointed in the restaurant at dinner, though we had been told it was reasonably priced for the area and had good food."
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The hotel was very clean and the staff was professional and courteous. Old Town Alexandrea was beautiful and having a room right there that is walking distance to everything made it better. I most definitely would stay here again. The only down side is parking is way over priced. Everything else was awesome.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",A wonderful hotel in a great location!
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection","We have stayed at this hotel a few times on the past. Our most recent stay was somewhat disappointing. Quality of the sheets, towels, toilet paper used to be much better. However, the price was good for the location"
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",I was grateful to get a hotel in the area after the windstorm had knocked out power. My 97 yr old companion had to have AC in the 90+ degree days. Having a restaurant connected was a priority when making the reservation. The handicap room didn't have grab bars in the bathroom or walk in shower. The door was large enough to accommodate a wheelchair. No in room coffee. The staff was very nice.
"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",The only thing weird about our stay is that it was extremely creepy at times because of the old feel. The heater made this weird sneeze sound.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Me, my fiancée, our toddler and family friend all stayed a week in Newburgh at this hotel. We came to do visit family and spend most of our time in NYC. It was only an hour from the city. We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancée. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,移動途中で宿を探していて、安くて主要道路から近かったので選びました。夜遅いチェックインでしたが、対応は親切でした。不潔なわけではないのですが、ホテル全体のニオイが気になりました（古いラブホみたいな。。。）。朝食付きでワッフルが焼けたりするのが良かったです。
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nous avons été déçu cette année. Les lits n'étaient très confortable et la propreté laissait à désirer. Nous penseront surement à changer d'hôtel l'an prochain. C,est dommage car cet hôtel offrait un meilleur service. Par contre le personnel est très bien et la localisation de l'hôtel par rapport à la route 87 nord est très bien. Bon restaurant à proximité."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Il était difficile de conserver une température ambiante puisque nous devions partir le chauffage et une fois la température voulue on l'arrêtait mais quelque instant après la chambre refroidissait rapidement du à une mauvaise isolation. Vraiment inconfortable et surtout très bruyant.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,oude troep. tapijt ligt los. gangen en hallen één grote dump. het is allemaal maar nét schoon. durf niet met blote voeten in de kamer te lopen

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"7/10, à cause du prix, mais ca vallait le coup malgré tout. Acceptable"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"La chambre était mal entretenue, le petit déj. n'a que le nom, la cuisine est en désordre, la poubelle est brisé, la salle de bain est plein de cheveux, les serviettes vieilles et déchirées, la table à repasser est trop trop salle (on me l'a changé)...Bref, le rapport qualité/prix est à discuter.NE PASSER PASSEZ PAS PLUS D'UNE NUIT À CET HÔTEL!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Vale o que se paga.Os corredores tem cheiro forte de cigarro.O quarto é amplo e o banheiro bom.Café da manhã bom.Estacionamento gratuito.Próximo de Woodbury e West Point.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nous n'avons resté seulement qu'une nuitC'est difficile d'être plus sélectif
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Il semble que la femme de ménage utilise le même torchon pour tout nettoyer, de la toilette à la carafe de café. Cette hôtel ne vaux pas le prix demandé, même en spécial."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"room heater would not get really warm…front desk person came up, put it on 85, and said it seemed ok to her.when you stood in front it was slightly warm, a few feet away and it felt like air-conditioning.All night long it blew on the bed, i ended up sleeping in my coat (no extra blanket)When i turned it off the room turned into a deep-freeze."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,chambre propre et confortable avec micro ondes et frigo - centre commercial proche - petit déjeuner correct
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Il y avait une mauvaise odeur dans les corridors et la chambre.Les murs de la chambre étaient tachés.Le tissu recouvrant le fauteuil étaient plus qu'usé.Certains articles du déjeuner était servit dans l'emballage de plastique de l'épicerie.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,chambre pas propre cafetière salle .....pas recommandable pour une famille
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Odeurs épouvantable, besoin d'etre démoli et rebatit"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Salle de bain TRÈS ordinaire . Nous n'y retournerons plus.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"En route pour New York, proximité, pour aller prendre un bateau de croisière."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Zimmer, gross geräumig mit Terrasse, Aber die Leute im Hotel alle durchweg unfreundlich! Geben Sich keine Mühe, Internet funktioniert in kaum einem Zimmer über Frühstück brauchen wir nicht zu reden, die Bagels waren Abfallprodukte!! Total Entäuscht vom rund um service."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The only thing wrong with the room was the smell, musty/moldy, like the room had been wet at one time.  Otherwise it was fine."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I simply needed a cost effective place to stay while visiting West Point. The hotel lobby is nice and the rooms were decent; however, the remaining decor and condition was quite dated. There were no observable amenities (pool/recreation). Location and proximity to restaurants, stores, etc was a bonus."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The location was great. However the rooms need to be renovated desperately. If they were it would be perfect.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel room was ok for the money I paid but the hallway as you were walking to your room smelled like old smoke. Needs some updating.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was good for the price, good service we just used it to sleep,and it was good could have more cable chanels"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hallway had over a dozen green trash bags and a dolly just left there. Doors etc were in disrepair. Hotels.com said it was pet friendly but when I got to the office there was a big sign NO PETS. We had to take turns sleeping in the car with the pooch.The room itself was clean and comfortable.Hotels.com had me booked for 7/26 when I booked for the 28th. After a 1/2 hour call they got it straightened out but charged me an extra $15. After I returned home I was able to get a refund from hotels.com.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was getting work done on the plumbing and the dirty water was backed up in the tub and sink, Also we had to take a cold shower the next morning. Also not a friendly check in either.."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Odeurs ��pouvantable, besoin d'etre d��moli et rebatit"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Not bad for the price. I had a refrigerator and a microwave in my room. Also includes breakfast and the motel is conveniently located. Beds are not the most comfortable.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nothing works, I mean nothing. Dirty all over. Called every hotel in the area but sold out. Never again. The all lie about fixing the problem, never happened."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Bath tab had rubber mat.But under it was awfully dirty!

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"For the cost, I can't complain one bit. This location was great and it was a very nice stay."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This location is very dated and in need of significant upgrades. First floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot. I didn't feel very safe at all. The room had a funky odor and I just didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings. With the exception of the bathroom, it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices. Also the table and chairs were very crammed in the room. I am a small person and had a very difficult time sitting at the table and trying to do work at the table. I wouldn't have stayed here based on previous comments, but I needed a room for one night and this was about all that was available. I honestly was tempted to sleep in my car."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Had toilet issues and staff didn't care when we brought it to their attention. The linens didn't smell clean.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was amazed at the hotel price. What I liked about the hotel was it was close to very fine restaurants and great shopping centers. I also loved that it had access to the pool right from your room if we were staying there in the summer. The room had amneties that were great. The room had a Fridge, Microwave, etc. The breakfast was adequate and fresh.The night time staff at the front desk were rude if you called for information or asked for something."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Alright for a one night stay in a very basic hotel with no frills. Everything seemed outdated and needs to be freshened up a bit. Continental breakfast was alright, but there wasn't any fruit to chose from, and only small tubs of peanut butter for protein. It was interesting to see the 1960's architecture of the building."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My husband, our 2 month old, and myself reserved a room for NYE since we were visiting family in the area. Property and building is very nice and well kept. However, service is nothing special - when I arrived the front desk clerk was on the phone and did not make any note of my arrival. When he finally got to checking me in, he requested that i sign an absurd note stating that i will not throw parties in the room (yes it was New year's eve, but we were with a baby, for crying out loud!). Room was comfortable, fridge came in handy, and balcony a nice touch (even in December).Breakfast was great, but morning front desk clerk again was not very welcoming or friendly when I asked for toothpaste (i offered to pay!). The best workers are the house keepers - extremely friendly, even though they had to work on january 1st!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It's an older place. People were pleasant and helpful. Not the cleanest bathroom really needs some up grades.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,My pillows were all dirty and the floor was wet like if they did a carpet shampoo right before we got their.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,My pillows were all dirty and the floor was wet like if they did a carpet shampoo right before we got their.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We were not impressed at all!!. It was convenient, because it was next to the airport, but wasn't very clean. The continental breakfast room was very small, and wasn't impressed with the whole impression on the motel.. We had to book to another motel, and had a hard time getting a refund back, because we had booked 2 nights there, and stayed 1. The manager however did give us the refund back. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless it was just an overnighter!!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,well to start off the front desk person was nasty and should not in anyway be the first person you come into contact in a service related establishment.It was poorly decorated and rundown.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The HJ Staff were very accommodating in that I asked for a change from King to 2 double beds because of a change in plans. Staff were very polite and helpful. The room was neat and tidy. The bathroom had visible mold in the bathtub. The lights were a bit confusing as there is a main switch which allows you to turn on the other room lights. The lights next to the bed were not working at all. The surrounding plastic on the hair dryer was cracked and broken. It made a terrible sound when turning on for use. The breakfast was fresh and presented in a well maintained fashion. The service person was always looking to clean tables and refill items as needed. He was very attentive.Our room was on the second floor. I did not see an elevator, as that would have been helpful. The ice machine was not working on the 2nd floor. The location is Central Valley Newburgh and close to shopping and sightseeing."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Clerk was polite but not welcoming in any way. I felt like I was bothering her and interrupting her day. Since the floors were so filthy especially behind the beds and in the bathroom, I wondered if the sheets and towels had been washed."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"H��tel bien pour le prix, r��ception et g��rant pas de fa��on ou tr��s froide. Bien situ�� pour nous, ne respencte pas les demandes sp��ciales."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"the front desk is nice. Breakfast includes bagel, waffle, coffee, apple, cereal, milk... yummy but does not have egg and bacon.the room is spacious. But the toilet got stuck after our use."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was ok for a one night stay.This hotel needs to be renovated.The room was ok... Remote for tv not working, light above sink not working and breakfast was basic."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair. The tub dripped constantly. The floor had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the desk. The sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't lock after hours. The whole place except the lobby is in disrepair.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel was so sketchy that I could not even sleep. The heater/air was loud and did not work properly. We could not even think of eating breakfast there. Just a waste of money and good nights sleep.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"For us over 60 people , Howard Johnson was the first big name in Motels and ""on the road fine dining"" Had not been near one in years. Stayed here for the price and close to the exit. Satisfied both needs."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Cleanliness of hotel a problem. Would not stay there again!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed for the first night of my honeymoon before we jetted off the next morning, kind of wished we could have stayed here! Very pleased :)"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was conveniently located near eateries and shopping malls and plazas. However, the hotel is a little old and need some TLC. Nevertheless, it was quite and livable."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The entire place needs to be re-done, however the rooms were clean and it was quiet. I would not book his place for a romantic weekend, but it might be good enough for a Republican convention..."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My room was clean, large and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and had a good shower. Great for one night budget stay when in the area"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nothing great, room was clean but not worth the cost they charged. 4 star cost at 2 star ratings. Was stuck in a jam for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed. Room was clean but needs to be updated just like the rest of the hotel. Continental breakfast was very weak."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The room condition and breakfast were both good. And with high performance.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nice stay for us, cheap and convinent. Free breakfest and internet"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,travel experiance says it all
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Wouldn't recommend to stay @this hotel,not clean @all"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Very close to the winery we went too, as well as OCC...."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This was an inexpensive place to stay before a very early flight. It was clean and comfortable. The bathroom had been updated a little but the rest of the place looked like it did 20 years ago with some improvements. Not that is a bad thing, it is just not up-to date."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Several friends and I stayed at this hotel over a Saturday.  I was a little nervous, having read some other reviews, but we took a shot.  Yes, the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke, but the room did not.  The bedding was clean and fresh, and the room itself was very clean.  We had asked for a cot, and when we arrived to check in it was already in the room.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, even after check-out, when I remembered that I had forgotten something and had to get back into the room.  The free breakfast was so-so, but coffee was good.  They have a microwave and fridge in the room, so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own.  For the price, it was a very pleasant stay."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel was old, worn out. Bedding, lenin, comforter was old. chair in the room was dirty and had tear. room was spacious. I got king bed for 2 days. they did not changed the sheets the second day. It was expensive for the price."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel is average in all categories. The rooms aren't immaculate, but they are clean enough. Each room has a balcony that offers privacy from your neighbors, which is a nice extra. I found the internet speeds to be adequate enough to enjoy my Netflix and browsing. Breakfast wasn't too shabby; they served waffles, toast, milk, concentrated juice, coffee, oatmeal, and oddly enough, Ho-Hos.The surrounding area does offer many eating and shopping options.I would use this hotel again if I am able to get a similar low price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This stay seriously updates my opinion of Howard Johnsons. Our room was huge, opening with sliding glass doors into a lovely garden area. the pool was large. Well heated and Indoors. They do need to add some healthier options to their complimentary breakfast."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,see my coment above
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Clean, spacious room. Pleasant service. Out of town but short drive in. Nice Italian restaurant nearby. Had an old tv in room, which worked perfectly. I think some rooms have flat screen. Many thanks from across the pond in England."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It is not an expensive place to stay for the night while away for work. Easy to miss the place at night since the big sign in front was not lit.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Room was dirty. Bathtub was grimy.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I didn't mind the stay,we were only here one night for the antiquie motorcycle cannonball rally. I am a non-smoker and I thought the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke. Other than that the hotel was great and the rooms were comfy. easy access to the highway and downtown Newburgh."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"for the price I paid, it was really worth it. Very simple hotel. I drove from Montreal to Woodbury for shopping, and it was a great location, far enough to be cheaper, but close enough to Woodbury (20 mins). Free breakfast and Wifi included. My only real complaint was that I had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel, but once you find it, it's easy (2 mins from highway 87)"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Vieille hotel chambre pas morderne mais propre, pensee pas au petit dejeuner d'inclus il ne restait plus rien nous sommes allee dejeuner au resto quand tu dis que oui il reste des cereale mais plus de lait, pas de jus, pas de pain, pas de bagel,pas de muffin,"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We stopped off here on a long journey to North Carolina. The room was clean and had everything we needed.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,My stay was ok. The staff was great. any problems they fixed right away. Thanks for the stay. close to the highway and very convenient. I had a car situation and there was a dealer that I could resolve the problem
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,My second time staying at this hotel. I would stay again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I chose this hotel based on price and reputation of being a decent hotel chain. Big mistake. The lobby looks nice and up to date, but the rooms are run down along with the remainder of the hotel. The only staff that was friendly, were the housekeeping laughing in the halls about their jobs. I interacted with 2 different people at the front lobby and neither one were nice. No ""How are you today?"" or even, ""How was your stay?"" when I was checking out. I doubt I will ever book again with Howard Johnson."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I paid too much for this hotel
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I am not a hotel snob but was very disappointed at the stay.  The room was outdated and smelly and the bathroom had mold in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there.  Even after we asked for it to be cleaned, the bathroom was still dirty.  Small things like the right number of towels would have been appreciate.  The owner was not pleasant."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Very worn down hotel with very poor A/C making the rooms extremely moist.Pool was covered by plastics and closed. Not cool when this was the sole reason for choosing this hotel in this remote area on a roadtrip.We will not stay there again and cannot recommend it.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I would stay here over and over again! Only bad comment is that one of the front desk persons was kind of rude to me for no reason. Other than that really liked this hotel :)
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"it was great,, tth e only point was the heat, the room were very cold when we arrived, but after 20 minutes , was fine."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,nasty what you would expect for the price
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,OK
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bed was made up with only a top sheet. No bottom sheet. Night manager was not at all appologetic, he merely gave me another sheet adnd sent me on my way.In the morning the day manager was more appologetic and called the head housekeeper over to talk to us. But by thta time the night manager had soured my attitude toward the place."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Our room could have been cleaner, but we were so tired we slept well.Our married daughter had to change rooms because the bathroom light was not working.  It also needed better cleaning and the phone did not work.The location"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"staff was friendly, one day our room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed. Would be nice if they could extend their breakfast hours to 10:00, but it was OK. Loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I had to check out of this hotel. When I turned down the covers, there were hairs from the pubis on the sheets!!!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This was the our first stop on a family vacation and I knew we would only be there for a short time so I wasn't expecting a lot.  We checked in around 9pm and the clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad. The room was clean but everything was old and/or not very well kept.  I was very disappointed with this motel and will not stay with Howard Johnson's again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Okay for the price $70. It's an old hotel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not very friendly, especialy when asked for an additional pillow. Was told they had only eneough for two per bed. Mold and dirt in the room. Breakfast Cereal was stale. Will not return."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nothing special but good enough for a night stay...
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel itself was very decent, but my room was a little chilly and I had to retrieve my own blanket instead of it being brought to me."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel was obviously older and worn, but the room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included and it included fresh made waffles, fruit and cereal."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good hotel for a quick stop over. Close to NY city and Woodbury outlets. Clean comfortable room. Area has lots of restaurants.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,A nice clean room .
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The staff was very helpful with our booking mix-up. They were very helpful and friendly while resolving our dilemma.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Upon arriving at the front desk we were directed to drive around to the back of the building. When entering the building we found the door to be unsecure - meaning it was unlocked and anyone to approach the building could have walked in. We didn't need to use the swipe card. Also we noticed some man sitting out in a utility type work truck from the time we arrived (approx 6:00p) until midnight. Next day, a man (not sure if it was the same one or not)was sitting INSIDE the building on the stairs leading to the second floor, which we had to use to get to our room. It seem obvious that he was not a patron of the hotel as he was eating & charging his cell phone from an outlet in the hallway. Also, we had toilet issues in our roomm which we had to resolve ourselves because upon calling the front dest I was told no staff was available to come up. So we had to go to the front desk and get a plunger and take care of the toilet ourselved. Upon getting to the front desk, there were 3 people standing around 'chatting'. It was so nice to know we had to pay a hotel for our stay AND take care of our own toilet without any attempt of assistance from them. Breakfast was not impressive nor did it have much variety either. OH! Yes, lets mention that the pool was under construction also which was not indicated when I booked with this hotel. It didn't appear any construction was going on, just looked like all the water was drained out of it. Was NOT happy about this at all!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The best thing about the Howard Johnson's is its proximity to Stewart Airport and some restaurants. We stayed one night for an early morning flight. We checked in which was OK as we were the only people checking in at that time. The entrance doors were not locked and as we entered through the back of the hotel, this was concerning. The room was OK, nothing great."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,None. Old water bottle found in floor under foot of bed
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel grounds were very dirty and litered. One exit door was half way blocked with a service or laundry cart. Room had a musty smell to it. The room was spacious which was good. Security was good - I felt safe in the hotel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The staff was friendly, the beds were comfortable, ice machine and AC was working great. I had a great stay and have no complaints."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We went to the Army game at West Point.  Go Army!!  We also rode our bikes in the crisp fall air and beautiful leaves.  Great weekend!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Stayed here for 3 days. Felt right at home. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Hotel was being updated but more than I expected for the value. We will stay here again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The check-in counter was quite high. I am 5'2"", and had difficulty writing on it due to the height. When I stepped to the left where there were pamphlets the clerk thought I had gone away, because she couldn't see me any more. The bed and room were comfortable and clean. Complementary breakfast was limited, but the help was very helpful and friendly. Very close to highway, can hear truck noises especially."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Well no was bad, but the tower don't look clean, the bed is no to good,"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Howard Johnson's has a great deal for the money. Very spacious room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This hotel was not what we saw online.  The rooms were not clean. I had to ask for a different room because bathroom was not clean. The hotel really needs to be updated.  Breakfast was terrible!  I would not recommend anyone to stay there.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The Newburgh Howard Johnson is not a nice hotel, but it's about what you expect from a two-star hotel chain. Service was fine, but there were definitely some gruff housekeepers. The room was kind of weird, it felt like the stuff might fall apart at any minute or something. But it wasn't disgusting, and it certainly wasn't unbearable. I stayed there for just under two weeks, and it wasn't fun, but it also wasn't awful for the price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The worst I've ever had to stay in a room over night.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed two seperate nights, Sunday and Friday, midway point of trip. This hotel has obviously had a recent renovation and upgrade. Rooms were large, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room. No elevator, but first floor corridor is accessible from the lobby, no steps. NOTE 2: Restaurant next door is separate from hotel. Not recommended."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"First I was uncomfortable with lady at front desk making copies of my ID and credit card, walked into room and the carpet was old smelly and a huge iron print mark burn in the carpet, after settling in I turned on television realized that remote required to batteries later on went to use bathroom will forward pictures do you may review and I will wait for your opinion."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Il y avait une mauvaise odeur dans les corridors et la chambre.Les murs de la chambre ��taient tach��s.Le tissu recouvrant le fauteuil ��taient plus qu'us��.Certains articles du d��jeuner ��tait servit dans l'emballage de plastique de l'��picerie.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel staff was friendly, from when I first checked in at around 1am until the morning I left.  They are updating the hotel though never heard any noises from that or any other room.  They were booked yet it was so very quiet.  Fantastic size King size bed with a pull out couch, table, Samsung TV, Tall Refrigerator and microwave.  I loved the 2 sinks idea and made it very convenient for me and my friends to stay there.  Next year we plan on having another get together and I will be staying at that hotel!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,An excellent motel for the price. Room was large and comfortable. Room was spotlessly clean. Shower had excellent pressure. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Room had a smell to it.other than that it was great.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I only needed a place to stay one night, so it was good to use for then. However there were stains on a pillow, carpet was filthy and there was a cigarette burn on the comforter even though it was a smoke free room."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The bedding was old and stained .I went to Marshalls and bought new pillows ,sheets and blankets so I could sleep. The sliding door jamm was broken in the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein. I would not stay there again. This wSax the worst motel I ever stayed at."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"There was a fire alarm on our last night, but I believe the management and staff handled it well. There was no real danger and the guest that caused it received a proper corrective action"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The location was well suited to my needs with regard to the airport, food, museums and my need to be at the US Military Academy each day."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I stayed here during golf tournament at Falkirk Golf & Country Club. 20 minutes away along the local and scenery road.It is a decent hotel. They were doing reconstruction/painting right now. Had to bear with the smell but overall was OK.The hotel lobby is beautiful and the check-in was smooth. Breakfast was great. Good food. Waffle maker was a plus.My room was facing the parking and had a sliding door, so I can get in and out easily without having to go through the main door.There are abundance of restaurants and shops nearby. Chillis, Panera, TGI, BK, Walmart etc etc you name it.Excellent!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Great
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"There was a problem with the bathtub in the bath and the remote control for the TV did not work.  I left a note for the maid, but it was not resolved."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was fine. The room rate was fine. The continental breakfast was very sketchy. When I checked in at 8:30 PM, there were 2 pieces of fruit in trays in a very tiny lobby area. When I went down for the continental breakfast at 7 AM, the same 2 pieces of fruit were there. Tables were dirty. No plates. Nothing fresh. The breakfast was minimal and done as cheaply as possible."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This was my second stay at this hotel. I will not be back. The room was not very clean. The pillows definately needed to be replaced. I found it very difficult to adjust the thermostat to a comfortable temperature.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Awfull
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This is shelter, NOT Hotel. I wanted to go somewhere else but all area hotels where booked ,so I did not have choice but stay over 2 nights. This is joke. There should be some inspections done and close this place. Rooms are old and dirty, service is horrible. I cant say one good thing about this place. It wasnt... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We chose this Howard Johnson's because we thought it was a reliable franchise, convenient and moderate in price. While conveniently located off the Interstate it was sub-sub-par in quality. The carpet and bedspread were soiled and dirty - we left our shoes on - the ice bucket had not been emptied or cleaned and had bugs in it. And, the bathtub was totally unappealing with a plastic mat glued on the tub floor - we didn't shower or bathe. Needless to say we would never choose to stay here again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I liked the hotel. I was okay, they were doing construction but it was not that bad. Kinda a weird neighborhood, but it was decent. There was a lock on the door."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We only used HJ for an overnight stay after a wedding. The facilities were clean enough but nothing fancy.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Unfriendly front desk receptionist. broken ice machine, no fridge in room"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"the clerk could not find our phoned- in reservation. When he finally did it was under smoking. My husband has asthma and we had requested no smoking. It took quite a while to find a room. The clerk also told me the wrong time for breakfast. It was over when we came down at 9:30. He and the staff were very friendly. Our experience was good. There was an awesome and very friendly restaurant a few feet from our front door. And across the highway was Orange County Choppers. Yah!! (not or mission, pleasant surprise!)"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"As a grad student, I look for cost, comfort, and safety. Howard Johnson simple, and gets the job done. Limited option for breakfast."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,excellent
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Shower had mold. Room smelled bad.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel has not been updated in 50 yrs. Upon check in I needed to take a shower to attend an event. The towels were wet. When I went to the front desk the attendant was eating and with a full mouth she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the new machines. She handed me dry towels that were probably as old as the hotel, they were thin and with holes in them. One was even blood stained. As far as cleaniness is concerned the room was filthy. There had to be years of build up of cob webs around the heater. There were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained. Their idea of a continental breakfast was a rotting apple that was in the basket for 3 days and a couple of stale pieces of bread. The hotel was rated a best value and it was far from that. Even at 58 dollars a night it was far from a value. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I moved to West Point and all of the other hotels were booked. I was a bit aprehensive about the hotel, but it was actually ok. The staff was friendly, but furniture was a bit dated. I recommend this hotel, but if you're taking a special vacation - why in the heck are you going to Newburgh, NY??!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Terrible hotel. I dint know how i spent that night. Very outdated and disgusting. I was ripped off by paying 104$ for the night but i hd no choice we were very tired...never again
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bed OUCH! Locking key door in back parking area of hotel sometime was working, most times bypassed allowing ANYONE inside. Next to (maybe 50 yards) MAJOR expressway (TRUCKS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT). Hot buffet breakfast was a waffle machine and a toaster for bagels with coffee. Pool NONOPERATIONAL (this is New York maybe waiting for snow to work on....never saw ANY repair activity there during the week."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The staff was friendly and helpful, but they forgot to deliver an important message to me when I checked in.  The stay was pleasant and I especially enjoyed their hot complimentary breakfast (i.e. waffles)."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Honestly, I have nothing wrong to say about this hotel It was at a great price, good location. I wasn't expecting a resort type thing, just something quick for business up there. It met my standards and I'd definitely go back."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I booked a non smoking room, I put in a quarter of smokers. the hotel is reasonable, the location is good and was close to where I needed to be. The restaurant Union Square in front of the hotel is worth the trip!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Did the job. I slept well enough ate a good breakfast. Front desk lady was friendly, but couldn't check anybody in at first- took about 30 minutes for her to get the computer working. The price was reasonable, so I tempered my expectations. Outwardly, the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however, once we entered the room there was an unpleasant odor and a closer look showed the room could have been a bit cleaner. For the price I was satisfied however."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,we stayed her because we had an early flight next day the location is great but they need to take care of the hotel!!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Comfortable beds, clean room, pleasant and helpful staff, and very convenient access to stores, restaurants, and main highways at a very reasonable price. Only real complaints would be the musty smell of the hallway and the fire alarm caused by a faulty alarm attachment in one of the rooms...an alarm our daughter didn't even hear in our room on the second floor."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"NO hot water in the shower in the pm, or am.Told the front desk, but it was almost check out time...beds were comfortable and room was clean though."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We were unable to book our room until Jan. for the May graduation at West Point. I looked for the closest hotel with the highest rating per guest. This is what I found. I found out while staying in Newburgh it has a very high murder rate, in the Nation! We were right by the freeway and not residential around us so I did feel safe. The room was one of the quietest I have ever stayed in. I could not even hear when Mom took a shower but there was the constant elevated interstate noise, but the room was clean even through there was huge stains on the bedspreads. The cleaning staff were friendly, the handyman who replaced the broken hairdryer was friendly, the rest were either rude or did not speak. The hotel is old, hallways still smell of smoke, rugs old, but they are working on maintaining it. Breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced. Who does not have toast? They only had cereal, bagged bagels and English muffins, some juice and alternated with bagged Danish or Belgian waffles. Our reservation was a mess when we arrived. It ended up with the receptionist being rude to the Hotel.com rep. In the end we got our room, reasonably priced during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled. This is also a ways to drive to West Point. I received no points from my family for booking this hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel etwas abseits gelegen, rel. gut isoliert (trotz Autobahnn��he), gutes continental breakfast, grossz��gige Zimmer, gutes Bett. Preisw��rdig."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Terrible. Room filthy, First room ,we couldn't stay after the first night. We took pictures I believe you can find a better quality chair and ottoman at any landfill. Black mold on the shower, someone's used wash cloth on the shower curtain rod. Trash behind night stand and bathroom door and next to the bed on floor. After we complained we were put in another room, the maid made sure mostly things were clean. Put a sheet over the chair and didn't look at it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Everyone was very helpful because I kept getting lost.  I enjoyed my stay and would visit and stay again if I am in the area.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Clean and convenient for the central Hudson Valley.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The water did not work in our room.s shower on our first morning. It was repaired for our second morning.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My mother always said if you can't say something nice it's best to say nothing at all. Here goes "" ""."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,My mother always said if you can't say something nice it's best to say nothing at all. Here goes .
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel was decent. Currently under renovation. Room size was huge plus included two sinks.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel was decent. Currently under renovation. Room size was huge plus included two sinks.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,my stay was comfortable. I was just there overnight on business I like staying here because it's almost to where I have to go is clean and comfortable I have restaurants nearby
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I have a relative who lives in nearby Monroe, who did not have enough room in her home to accommodate my family so for my needs as far as having a place to sleep at night and shower, the location was great and the room was acceptable. It was clean despite the dated appearance. I've stayed in much asthetically pleasing hotels, but for my needs at the time, I was quite satisfied with the accommodations. The staff was very friendly and provided stellar customer service, and this includes the housekeeping staff. I would highly recommend for a quick stay."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We had a good experience at this hotel. It was quiet, clean, and comfortable. Certainly a good value for the price we paid.A few minor drawbacks: no miniature fridge in the room; the dining area for the continental breakfast was way too small, with not enough seating room for all the hotel guests having breakfast(or attempting to do so). But we stayed during a holiday weekend(Columbus Day), so perhaps on most other days it wouldn't be a problem.The staff was courteous and helpful. I would certainly stay there again myself, and would recommend the hotel to others also."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Its a howard johnsons, you get what you pay for. Looks like they are redoing a lot but the room smelled a little musty. It was fine."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,AWESOME !! Was absolutly great for the price!! Beds are comfortable and rooms clean :) Will def stay again when I go back up that way.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"it was perfect , egal at what we paid, it rich our attent, except the room was very cold when we arrived, but after 20 minutes was ok."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair. The tub dripped constantly. The floor had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the desk. The sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't lock after hours. The whole place except the lobby is in disrepair.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotels decoration is somewhat tired although the painters were working during our visit. The rooms are clean and have everything needed for an overnight stay. The restaurant next door was good and staff were very friendly. Given the cost and the fact that it included breakfast it was excellent value.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This is a nice motel. The free breakfast is very limited though.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Great location just south of 84. Very nice and attentive staff. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet with bagels, waffles, fruit, pastries was absolutely fine. Good security. Would return on another trip."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Decent place. Large room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bed bugs, will not be back."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The receptionit that was at the front desk when I arraived was quite cold and didn't look very professional with his t-shirt half open and exposing his breast. Only issue, the rest was very good! I loved the bedroom, the bed, everything was clean and comfortable. Nice balcony, nice view. The breakfast was so so. Ididn' t have time to check the pool. I would stay again at this hotel and/or recommend it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,For price you get a good value. Good location. No frills but that is understood. Everything worked and was clean.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This hotel was nice and a great value for the money. The free breakfast in the morning was basic but I loved the waffles. The staff was friendly and the location was clean. They only got four stars because it was not the nicest hotel but I would definitely stay a night again if I need a place for 1night.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This was the our first stop on a family vacation and I knew we would only be there for a short time so I wasn't expecting a lot. We checked in around 9pm and the clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad. The room was clean but everything was old and/or not very well kept. I was very disappointed with this motel and will not stay with Howard Johnson's again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was DIRTY, pillows were TERRIBLE, bathroom shower curtain was falling down, toilet seat didn't fit toilet, a/c heater unit was LOUD... The staff was very nice, lady at check-in was very helpful and lady that hosted the breakfast was super nice as well."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Room was dirty, chairs,furniture,TV was old with poor screen view and reception, dirt buildup along all the edges of the table, chairs,furniture and the chairs x2 were very dirty and ripped. The bed was not comfortable This hotel needs to upgrade beds,TV, furniture. I would not stay there again.continetial breakfast was poor, food tasted old. We had a poor stay. My wife was upset.we didn't even want to complain because I don't think it would have made a difference. Mr Rodriguez"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel has a very strange odor.  Rooms are quite dated and need major cleaning.  The shower was full of mold/mildew and the bathroom outlet did not work.  The bed and pillows are extremely uncomfortable and I am uncertain as to why rooms have sliding glass doors opening to a parking lot.  This is a major safety risk and moreover not very good soundproofing... you may as well have slept on the highway outside the room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Clean convenient and close to shopping. It did exactly what we needed it to do and it was a pretty good experience.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Old tired hotel good only for the lowest rate. WiFi worked only near the door. Drippy shower/tub. Bed lamp was not working- frayed plug. Can't park near room. Continental breakfast passable. Still, half the price of big chains, so if you only want to sleep..."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,hotel is average but bad smell all over no proper ventilation or ac filtration system .
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Great place to stay for the price
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My experience was alright. Staffs were friendly. Packing and WiFi is great. Surroundings peaceful and quiet.enjoyed the fruits options during breakfast. More varieties for breakfast food options on daily basis could be added Downside to Hotel that there is no Elevator, not recommend for Elderly persons with mobility problems. attended a Jehovah's Witness Convention at Newburghdine out at Flaming Buffet and Grill which was great!!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We stay there only one night (for shopping at woodburry outlet). It is very clean & quiet and breakfast is included. Worth the money.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Average rooms and prices
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The guy working front desk tried to cheat me. I booked room for 5person. But He said the room is 4 person booking, so I had to pay more. I got angry,and then he said I didn't have to pay. And the room smell terrible and hot water was out of order."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,None. Old water bottle found in floor under foot of bed
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nous n'avons rest�� seulement qu'une nuitC'est difficile d'��tre plus s��lectif
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I travel back home often. My first stay in HJI was pleasant, but this time not so much. The tile in the bathroom was broken and the bathtub was dirty. The water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower. I would not stay there again. The room smelled musty..."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Staff was polite and helpful
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel is a little tired and is in desperate need of a lick of paint on the outside. The room itself was ok; the bathroom could do with being ripped out and started again. For the price its hard to complain really. The pool is'nt actually in use. It is right next door to the Ornage County Choppers buidling which is worther a visit
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Very relaxing and enjoyable location. Close to several dining locations and shopping
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel was decent. Currently under renovation. Room size was huge plus included two sinks.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Close to OCC. Not cleaned behind furniture since forever. Close to interstate. But also noice from it at night.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"maid service was not up to par,coffee was not replaced after using.Bathroom sink was clogged."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Breakfast was terrible. Milk for cereal not cold, not even peanut butter for muffins. Room had a dirty pine sol smell. Difficult to control room temperature Beds so low to the ground and very hard, i like a firm bed but this was terrible"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Convenient lodging for our trip at a reasonable price.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Fasely advertised by the pictures from the Internet versus real life. Scarey looking at first sight looks abandoned.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"has me seriously re-thinking if I will ever use Expedia again!! Hotel was dingy, worn down, strange smell as soon as you walked in. The room was so dim and when we went to turn the lights on, nothing worked. We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!! Only one outlet in the room!!!! Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole! Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!! Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!! Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game. The Continental Breakfast was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!! Like I said, if this is what to expect from Expedia, I will never use them again, and I most certainly will never stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel again...."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Even though it was next to airport and thruway it was extreamly quiet.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"IT WAS OK, WE ONLY NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY OVERNIGHT. WOULD NOT COMEBACK DUE TO LACK OF CLEANLINESS."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Check in was strange. Except the receptionist had to yell down the hall to make sure my room was done - after she checked me in. I never had that happen before. My bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and towels were stacked on the controls to flush the toilet. Then I saw that there was a door going out to the ""patio"": no furniture out there...and the door was NOT LOCKED. If I hadn't checked, anyone could have entered my room. Oh, and the free wifi only works in the lobby and you might have to walk around your room to get cell phone service. To put the icing on the cake, the continental breakfast ""danishes"" consisted of generic ho-ho's and some other generic cinnamon bun. The English muffins were stale. Need I say more? I left as quickly as possible after breakfast."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I like this hotel because it is economical and the continental breakfast gives one a break on the pocketbook.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Lo barato sale caro
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was okay for the price. The website stated that the room had a balcony which it did but we were not able to open the door. One of the lamps next to the bed did not work. The continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for some protein, either eggs or peanut butter. Neither was available."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"AC unit in room was very loud but couldn't shut it off because room would've been too warm. The security door, giving guests access to hallway, was taped so anyone could walk thru hotel. Difficult to figure out shower controls."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,If your looking for a place to crash for a night you could stay at worst. You need to park in the back and no elevator to your room. So don't bring alot of luggage. Entering and exiting is confusing because exit doors look like hotel room doors. Besides low price nothing to rave about. Looks like a room in the 70's. Bathroom was clean but all the piping old. Terrible shower heads and constant drip in my tub in my room. Stay away from room 108 if running water will bother you. Plus make sure you call for towels. Only 2 to a room so if you bring your wife there won't be a towel for you if she washes her hair. Stay here only if you need to emergency crash somewhere
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel is in serious need of consistent upkeep, given the rate they charge for the room. Ice maker broken, did not have hot water, toilet bowl stained. With it's current condition, this lodging should be downgraded to a MOTEL, not a hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was very nice and clean. The hall way carpet really needed to be changed, lots of stains but clean. We would stay there again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Awfull
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It's ok. It was a holiday weekend and availability was hard to find for my price point. If you are a hotel snob or OCD, you should probably spend more money for something else. It could definitely be cleaner and be made to smell fresh. The room smelled ok but the hallway smelled weird. The continental breakfast is ok to... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,for the money it was ok ..very nice area newburg..u get what u pay for on the cheap...the nite desk person was not very nice at all...close to hyway and local resturants ....best was we were next to ORANGE COUNTY CHOPPERS NEW PLACE...
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Excellent hotel close to Stewart airport and perfect for any OCC American chopper fan / Paul Jr follower. I stayed wide family here and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was more than adequate for anyone
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Basic, older accommodations. Liked the two sinks, one being outside bathroom. Neither sink drained water well. Beds were comfortable. Wifi didn't reach to the rooms, but was available free in the lounge area. The complementary breakfast buffet was adequate."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel staff was friendly, from when I first checked in at around 1am until the morning I left. They are updating the hotel though never heard any noises from that or any other room. They were booked yet it was so very quiet. Fantastic size King size bed with a pull out couch, table, Samsung TV, Tall Refrigerator and microwave. I loved the 2 sinks idea and made it very convenient for me and my friends to stay there. Next year we plan on having another get together and I will be staying at that hotel!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Only major issue was it took way to long to warm up the room
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Not at all what the pictures at Hotel.com showed. I took pictures of the room, #1. There was old body fluids on the floor at the end of the bed. #2. There was old body fluids on the chairs that where also broken. #3. There was mold growing in the shower. #4. The ceiling tile in the bathroom was letting go of the frame work and stained with water. #5. Moved the night stand to use the receptacle only to find broken plastic and spider webs. #6. The bathroom door had been kicked in at one time and painted over didn't close at all. #7. The desk top was peeling off from the desk. #8. The sliding door to the outside was so thick with dirt. So to end this from ever happening again, I will never use Hotel.com or stay at a Howard Johnson, It only took this one time. I only wish I could attach the pictures I took of this room."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This was my first time there, I was only there for one day and my friend n I enjoyed the service n the complimentary Breakfast the morning after arriving there."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,No and never want to live here againNo and never want to live here againNo and never want to live here again!Big noise !
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel mit Pool war angeboten. Der Pool war aber nicht benutzbar. Der Service war nicht sehr freundlich.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Walked into the room to find the heat was turned off It took all night to warm up the room. Very drafty in there. Found a moldy looking ceiling tile above the shower.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Non-smoking floor smelled smokey but room was good and breakfast was good.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The only thing good about this hotel was the treatment from the staff. I was very unhappy with the condition of the hotel and the rooms. I did better off sleeping in my car. The only reason why I stayed was because of a funeral for my brother that passed. I will not be visiting this location ever again. This must really be a joke on websites stating the good reviews at this hotel. Just terrible and it will not be recommended to anyone I know that is for sure.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We just used the hotel for a place to relax and sleep.  The location is great because it is not too far from the major highways and there are plenty of places to eat.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was nice but the king bed in my room was caved in in the middle. Okay for one person, but I had to climb up out of it each morning. If there was more than one person, they would both have to be very comfortable with being trapped in the middle of the bed. No hotel charging anything should have a bed in this poor condition, although, in my case, it worked out all right. Maybe they only give this room to single people."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bad experiment. I accidently booked 2 rooms in this hotel, and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge. They do not permit any return"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Its generally ok. The staff were very helpful, they check us in early (after 7 hours of drive)."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Older hotel hallways and rooms. Clean with comfy bed. Nice lobby and breakfast area nice enough.  Needs updating like doors on rooms and bath fixtures. Saw a beaver or possum type animal outside going under cement slab outside glass patio doors during early daylight evening hours.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I wrote it initially
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel is located in a very good centralized location. The staff was very polite and helpful.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"nice place for a good price. Clean, comfy, etc. I would definitely recommend it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Dirtiest hotel ever!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was very nice and inexpensive.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Needed to stay at a convienient, close to highway and reasonable priced hotel on the way to final destination. Everything was good and we slept great."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"After reading all the reviews posted prior to my stay at this hotel I was thinking...am I crazy for still booking a room here? But everyone was staying at a top of the line suites hotel but my finances didn't allow it so I stayed here. What a blessing! Other than the hallways smelling like smoke and kind of musty & the pool not being open the room itself was very clean, the bed was clean & comfortable, the breakfast was good & for the price this was an excellent choice. The location is great & it surrounded by plenty of places to eat. I recommend it for the budget minded person."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My boyfriend said it best when he said ""it's just a normal hotel room"". But I wanted something more."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,remote missing in room..clerk could not give us another one because mgr had left... wallpaper peeling in room..blanket needed cleaning..bathroom tiles and tub needed through cleaning...not very impressed with rooms
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Terrible. Hotel is old and falling apart. Our room was dirty!!! We stayed in a ground floor room and its patio door was permanently locked by a nail - it felt so not safe!!! Bathroom walls were broken. Stained and gross carpet. Stained bed sheets. Staff were so unfriendly. Horrible breakfast. I'll never recommend this hotel to anyone.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Just another worn out property purchased by a buzzard to extract whatever profit is still possible.Leaky faucets.Poor drains.Caved bed.Exposed wiring in broken lamp.Tired furniture.Ancient TV with purple haze.Sad . . . almost as sad as Chris Christie ; )
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Staff was friendly. Check in was smooth. Continental breakfast was whats to be expected. Bagels, muffins, DIY waffles. Only negative were the comfortability of the bed mattresses. A bit hard. And the pillows were fairly poor also. However at price point id still recomend staying here."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Terrible terrible experience! We arrived at 10pm and it was as if the staff was half asleep .... Gave us a room whose bathroom door won't lock. We asked for a room change (and got one) but that room had the same issue! We asked for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk tells us that the previous room's door didn't lock since it's handicap accessible. If he knew this before, Why he couldn't give us the room we asked for on the first swap is beyond me!The heating was average at best! Must have taken a few hours for the room to be in livable condition ... We had kids with us and they were literally shivering.Bathroom tub water system was horrible. All in all, don't waste your money on this one!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Although the staff is friendly, this hotel is extremely outdated. Our room smelled horrible and the carpets were so filthy we were afraid to take off our shoes. The blankets and sheets had stains and were worn to the point of being see thru in places. In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business. Disgusting."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed here just over night whilst driving through. Reservation was efficient, check in staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was ok clean, but did smell a bit. Rooms are run down. Door to outside opens which is great but does not lock properly and relies on a pole behind the door to prevent the sliding door from being moved.... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good price and was clean. Bed was comfortable. Only complaint is that the entry to the stairs and hallway smelled quite strong of mustiness trying to be covered up with chemicals. Not a good mix. Plenty of food choices in area. Neptune Diner is minutes away and was delicious!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I stayed in this Hotel while visiting my son at West Point.  I was very concerned with the parking.  It was in the back between the hotel and woods. I was uncomfortable with leaving a rental car out there.The room smelled like smoke even though I had asked for a nonsmoking room
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Helpful staff
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Il ��tait difficile de conserver une temp��rature ambiante puisque nous devions partir le chauffage et une fois la temp��rature voulue on l'arr��tait mais quelque instant apr��s la chambre refroidissait rapidement du �� une mauvaise isolation. Vraiment inconfortable et surtout tr��s bruyant.

Vraiment inconfortable et surtout tr��s bruyant.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Fire alarm went off 4 times in one night, 10:00PM until about 9:00AM.  The rooms were dismally outdated.  Bathroom tiles were broken and grout was nasty.  Shower/tub was dirty, standing water ankle deep every time you took a shower.  Not enough outlets to plug anything in, so don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day. Not enough seating for the Continental Breakfast area.  The cleaning ladies were very pleasant, always made sure there were clean linens in the bath and beds.  The location is marked clearly from the highway, but no sign in front of the facade of the building.  Plenty of dining nearby.  Would not recommend this hotel, unless of course you want to become acquainted on a first name basis with the local fire dept........"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This is an older property that is adequate but not especially good.  The room we had was reasonably comfortable.  The hotel has two floors but no elevator, and one must navigate stairs to enter the first floor from the most convenient entrances.  The breakfast had very few choices, and no healthy options.  The hallways are very long and somewhat dingy.  Overall, it is not the worst possible experience, but it is not one I would recommend for most people."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"To Start the visit with this hotel, we checked in and were directed to go around to the back parking lot which has pot holes all around and was not safe looking.  The garbage area was viewable and nasty looking.  As we entered into he entrance in the back of the hotel, there was a nasty smell.  When we got to our room, we opened the door and the room smelled just like the rest of the hotel.  If we hadn't got there so late and had an early appointment, we would have left that hotel.  I would not recommend someone to stay at that hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"reeks of smoke throughout the entire hotel except for the front desk area, stay at the Ramada down the street for the same price! better food, service, rooms, sheets, heaters, showers.. etc.. Ramada is 5 star compared to this place for the same price!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel was cheaply priced, Ideal for a 1 night stop-over each way, during spring vacation. However, we now know not to go by the price in future!! The place was really shabby, our bathroom was not clean and the lobby did not look as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks. It also smelt heavily of smoke. The complimentary breakfast was as basic and as cheap as it could be. We do not recommend this hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,nice & courteous staff. close to almost everything. I will stay here again when I need to visit my daughter in college
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The staff was courteous, friendly and very helpful. However, that is no match for the sad state of affairs in this hotel. The level of disrepair is unbelieveable. The bed was more like a bowl, though I was able to change to another crappy room with at least a normal bed. The room was dirty and smelled like nothing I can readily describe, except that it wasn't good. I was seriously considering sleeping in my car. I will NEVER return, and probably not consider any Howard Johnson's hotel in the future."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This motel served it's purpose for my visit.   The bottom floor must have been the smoking section because of the strong smell of cigerate smoke.   I did not smell the smoke upstairs in my room.   The appreance externally was very clean.   The room I have was dated.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I heard of going green but come on, recycled sheets just don't cut it. Then you have to remake the bed yourself."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We come here yearly for several years now for our shopping @ woodbury & i have seen this place deteriorating overall. The staff, mostly the ones present in the dining area for breakfast just made me rate them low overall. we're not coming back & not recommending it to anyone."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not luxurious, but good value. Glad I made reservations; there were ""no vacancy"" signs everywhere. Hotel is a few miles south of I-84 and I would not have noticed it, just driving by -- and it probably would have been sold out, anyway."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This hotel was clean and nicely priced for a one nite stay on the way to Pennsylvannia.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and then all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience. Less than 10 minutes after we got into the room, we left even though it was 4:30 in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired. There was no question of asking for another room because if there are bedbugs in one room, you can just bet the entire hotel is infested."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel outside look nice but inside hallway is an old hotel. Room and hallway smell bad, we was stuck with snow during the time and have to stay extra day, Customer service was Ok. We later choose Super 8 in same location. Much better with same price range."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The place was filthy....dirty hairs stuck to the back wall of the tub!! The bath tub facet drizzled, you could not turn it off. The carpet was dirty as was the bedspread. If I had not been exhausted and desperate for a room I would have left!!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,chambre pas propre cafeti��re salle .....pas recommandable pour une famille
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was wonderful, everything that the review said it would be and more. Check in was super easy, they didn't have a problem finding my reservation. I would gladly recommend this hotel to any one."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I will never go back to that hotel I do not like that the room
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,At first sight was a little taken aback as it looked like it was abandoned. After checking in we discovered that it was very clean and the room was very clean and spacious. Also very quite. The hotel staff was very helpful and nice
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We've stayed @ this hotel a couple of times before, and the remodel done lately, really gives a nice fresher look.Make our stay more confortable."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Convenient
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Vale o que se paga.Os corredores tem cheiro forte de cigarro.O quarto �� amplo e o banheiro bom.Caf�� da manh�� bom.Estacionamento gratuito.Pr��ximo de Woodbury e West Point.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was large, and the extra sink was a plus. While the facility was somewhat dated, it was functionally adequate. We had no issues with any of the amenities or staff at this facility."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The only thing that I had a problem with at this particular location was the fact that a couple plugs were sparking when I tried to plug them in. But other than that it's a good hotel; recommend it.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I'm not one to write reviews, so this'll be short.  Bathroom sink was clogged, told front desk in the morning, fixed by the time I returned.  Bed - uncomfortable as hell.  Sheets/blankets were far too thin, mattress was hard as a rock.  Curtains were blackout with no sheers, so you could never open your windows without the people from across the way seeing everything you were doing.  No plugs nearby to charge near bed, had to unplug lamp.  No elevator to second floor. (Didn't really matter to me) Continental breakfast was total crap.  It's a place to stay cheaply."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"if you need a quick and short stay for one night and pay less for it you might want to stay here. Noisy AC all night, dirty bed sheet, glass doors barely locked and facing parking lot to make me uneasy all night."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"La chambre ��tait mal entretenue, le petit d��j. n'a que le nom, la cuisine est en d��sordre, la poubelle est bris��, la salle de bain est plein de cheveux, les serviettes vieilles et d��chir��es, la table �� repasser est trop trop salle (on me l'a chang��)...Bref, le rapport qualit��/prix est �� discuter.NE PASSER PASSEZ PAS PLUS D'UNE NUIT �� CET H��TEL!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,average
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip.  It was not worth the $118.00 price.  Should have been more like a $59.00 per night charge.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We were unlucky first of all being woken up in the middle of the night by the fire alarm. Because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear ""Algonquin"". We called immediately after we realized it was missing. The bear was not found and we know it was left close to the bed. We could only hope that it was passed to another girl that will love him as much as my daughter did."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel is only good for those who go for short stay for few hours, not good at all for overnight stay or with family. First I was given a room with dirty bathroom. On complaint the room was changed, this new room was not better than the previous one. Old, worn out, unclean/dirty, blanket, bed sheats,throws. Poorly cleaned bathroom. Smelly carpet. Front desk people not courteous, can not change the blankets/bedsheats. They have no time to come the room to look at the complaint of the customer. Worse thing was, next day there was not hot water in the room, on asking it was told that maintenance is working on it. No hot water was made available & I had to check out without taking shower.I will not come to this facility again & I do not recommend this to any one."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Everything was ok except the TV remote did not work and the desk person could not fix it.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was ok, but I really don't think, next time I got to Newburgh, that they will be the ones I return to. The man who checked me in was impersonal, and I felt like I was getting on his nerves a little. I didn't really see him again after check in, nor did I hear from him about questions, or concerns of the room. From the front, at first glance, I honestly thought that the place was closed. All in all, I was not impressed with the place, and will not return there."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The property is older but not in bad condition. It certainly provides the basic necessities. My only problem was their computer for guests could not reach the internet and the printer they had was out of ink.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good value for money.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Love the staff. Love how the place is built. The area is comfortable. What else....um....just overall great
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The room was perfect for what I needed. The bathroom could have used a slight upgrade..shower curtain was damaged and there was a little mold around the tub. Also on second day they didn't replace the coffee we used the day before...but I'm sure we could have gotten more if we asked.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"En route pour New York, proximit��, pour aller prendre un bateau de croisi��re."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We chose this hotel because is was $100 cheaper than the Holiday Inn Express we had always stayed at. The heater was either pumping out very hot air ( intolerable ) or totally off ( room was freezing - this was December); The bathroom was not that clean and the room smelled of mustiness. Oh, and the heater rattled when on. We had a horrible night's sleep. Next time? The extra $100 seems like the way to go"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This Hotel is VERY rundown.  Room was ok for a 1 night stay. I would not recomend an extended stay or if traveling with children.  The room had a bad odor, and the air conditioning did not work all that well. The website stated that the rooms had a fridge, but did not. It also has an outdoor pool that was not opened. It was covered up and had not been opened yet this year. And when it's 94 degrees outside that would have been nice to use the pool. My overall rating for this hotel would be poor."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Pour le prix c'est correct mais sans plus
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bed bugs, will not be back."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Not a great experience and the breakfast was poor.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,satisfactory stay after a long trip. king sized bed was comfortable and shower was nice
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room resemble motels of the 1950's. The TV was bad, no mattress pad on the mattress."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hallways smelled like dead animals. The bedspread smelled like vomit. There was a used condom wrapper on the floor. With the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked in, the staff was unfriendly and unhelpful. When asked for a new bedspread, the front desk said they were unable to replace it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"All the area BnB's were filled so this seemed lime a good alternative. It's a tired property that's overdue for a rehab. Let's see - one magnetic key didn't work, the bathroom light wouldn't work without a noisy fan, the tub wouldn't drain properly, floor lamp had a broken plug, I killed a large insect, and to top it off, the wireless internet didn't work during the duration of our stay.Best thing that I can say is that you have a great view of Orange County Choppers from the parking lot."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,NO HEAT IN 1ST ROOM LITTLE HEAT IN 2ND MOLD IN TUB. STAFF INDIIFFERENT AND DISCOURTEOUS
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Honestly, I have nothing wrong to say about this hotelIt was at a great price, good location. I wasn't expecting a resort type thing, just something quick for business up there. It met my standards and I'd definitely go back."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,checking into the hotel was the worst experience ive ever had. The guy who checked us in was about the rudest person ive ever experienced in a hotel room was decent for the price.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The personnel were very friendly and helpful. The rooms could have been cleaner. I wiped off the armchairs, table tops, etc., afterwhich their surfaces were much cleaner."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Overall, the room was fine. We weren't expecting anything special anyway as we weren't planning to spend much time in the room. However, the room wasn't really that clean. There were fingerprints all over the microwave, lamps, etc. which was pretty gross. As for the hotel itself, I would probably stay there again if it was the same price. We had free wifi, cable, and continental breakfast. We only paid $55 a night and you can't really beat that. The location was really good. It was close to shops and restaurants as well as the people we were visiting."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"THE STAY WAS WONDERFUL, THE ONLY THING I WOULD CONSIDER DOING IS PUTTING MICROWAVES AND MINI REFRIGERATORS IN THE ROOMS."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Was man bucht bekommt man ... Nichts aufregendes in jeder Hinsicht ..
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"If you like the Orange County Choppers show, you'd love to stay at this hotel as it is walking distance from where they shoot it. Hotel is very close to the Woodbury Outlet, you'll pay just a $1.25 toll to get there by car."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Agr��able, acceptable et confortable"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free and they reeked of cigarettes. The room looked like it has not been updated in years. The carpet looked dirty. We were so disappointed with the rooms that we checked out immediately and booked a different hotel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We needed a hotel convenient to the NY Thruway for a quick overnight and this fit the bill. Older decor, fairly clean, comfortable bed. It was a bit noisy as the person/people in the room next door left the tv on all night. Hard to sleep through the noise."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good value. Located at intersection of 2 freeways so is convenient to go on in any direction. The hotel is standard mid-range fare. free breakfast and coffee is a nice touch.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The desk staff were rude and acted like they didn't have the time of day for any of our questions or requests. The breakfast bar had great bagels but not much else. I mean, who ever heard of putting Swiss cake rolls out for breakfast? Pool was closed for repairs which was one of the main reasons we had chosen it but no mention of the upcoming repairs was mentioned when I called to inquire about it. Howard Johnson's used to represent quality when I was a kid but this one gives the company a bad name."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,old property needs upgrading but good value
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The ice maker was broken on the secind floor but was easy to find on the frist floor.  Hotel is older and looks like the rooms could be redone but they were clean.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stay away. Stinky, dirty rooms and hallways. Security doors never locked allowing 2 girls of the street to enter and were found sleeping in the hallway. Far over priced for what it is. No hot water."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Several friends and I stayed at this hotel over a Saturday. I was a little nervous, having read some other reviews, but we took a shot. Yes, the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke, but the room did not. The bedding was clean and fresh, and the room itself was very clean. We had asked for a cot, and when we arrived to check in it was already in the room. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, even after check-out, when I remembered that I had forgotten something and had to get back into the room. The free breakfast was so-so, but coffee was good. They have a microwave and fridge in the room, so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own. For the price, it was a very pleasant stay."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Very outdated and rundown. The Light Between the two beds Accord had a short in it and sparked and blew out when I turned it on outside was very Rundown. On my return trip I am staying in the same area but refused to go back there definitely not worth what I paid for it
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I had a quick trip to NY from Virginia and I was pleased with the facilities. Although an older place, it was clean and the staff was very pleasent."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The location was great but when I arrived it was hard to tell if they were open. The room had cobwebs on the furniture. The bed was very comfortable.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Just needed a place to stay for a night on my way to a wedding.  For the rate, it was a good deal.  Close to the highway (nice), room was spacious and clean, and breakfast was included."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nothing works, I mean nothing. Dirty all over. Called every hotel in the area but sold out. Never again. The all lie about fixing the problem, never happened."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Overall my stay was fine. What I will say is to check the balcony door abd your hear when you arrive. My door was slightly ajar and the heat was low...it makes for a chilly night to say the least when it is 1 degree outside.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,i got this room for one of my workers they did not have a room ready for him he had to sleep in there parking lot for 8 hrs before i manged to call some one and force them to give him a room the manger was rude to him and myself i would not stay at this motel tell again if it was a free i would travel out of my way before i went back i should have got a refund seems i only got a room for half the day
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I would never return to this dirty nasty place no mater how cheap it is. Disgusting
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel grounds were kept clean, Rooms have every thing you need for your stay and your comfort, Also very clean."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not so great. My band mates and I drove 20 hours straight, walk into the hotel, and when I started the check in process he clerk said I don't want any problems. He also mentioned not wanting to have to call the police and basically implied that he didn't want us there. We were polite, and respectful the whole time. When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the patio was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth 120 a night."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Breakfast was terrible. Milk for cereal not cold, not even peanut butter for muffins.Room had a dirty pine sol smell.Difficult to control room temperatureBeds so low to the ground and very hard, i like a firm bed but this was terrible"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel was old, and they were doing upgrades. Safe in room didn't work and bed was extremely hard. We had a tough time sleeping. Breakfast was ok"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"we booked a non-smoking room, and the sign on the door indicated that it was, but the room smelled terribly of smoke. The room and bedroom were dirty , and the linens were not clean and crisp. We were not happy with our stay."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The grass and weeds approaching the hotel were overgrown. The lobby had a funny smell and the room was disgusting. So much so that we didn't stay. We found another cleaner hotel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"the prices was good, but hotel needs some cosmetic work."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was worth the money paid, but it was not great. Although the room was clean, the beds lacked a bedding cover normally found on beds. Rather, there was only a small normal sheet between the bed and I. Other than this small, the room was decent and worth the price paid."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Good place, clean,and very cheap"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"has me seriously re-thinking if I will ever use Expedia again!!  Hotel was dingy, worn down, strange smell as soon as you walked in.  The room was so dim and when we went to turn the lights on, nothing worked.  We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!!  Only one outlet in the room!!!!  Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole!  Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!!  Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!!  Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game.  The ""Continental Breakfast"" was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!!  Like I said, if this is what to expect from Expedia, I will never use them again, and I most certainly will never stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel again...."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Good value, decent breakfast, adult novelty store next door :-("
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This Howard johnson's was close to a transportation hub permitting me travel to several destinations by bus, train, and air. The complimentary breakfast is a great way to start the day."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This is a rundown hotel with a sad excuse for a breakfast, failing amenities, uncomfortable beds and blah atmosphere. I stayed at better hostels then this hotel. It's really a rundown motel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was right off I-87 which was very convenient. Arrived late, left early. Breakfast was adequate. Bathroom towels were thin and needed upgrading. Amenities were sparse, but clean. I'd stay there again, but not for a long vacation."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,it was ok!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Expected somewhat more tha this. Was clean but smelled of smoking. The breakfast was not that great.; sale apples, no water jars, not good coffee, not a standard waiter care."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,great room for the money
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This place was fine for one night. Not outstanding, but fine. The door out to the balcony seemed like it didn't really seal tightly so there was a lot of noise from the highway. Our toilet didn't really flush all that well, which was kind of gross. And the comforter had definitely seen better days. But otherwise, it was clean and generally fine."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. The owners obviously haven't spent a nickel maintaining this place. I almost took pictures it was so bad. And the smell of mold and water damage will make you gag
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not certain the room was cleaned, the bathtub was rusted, only shampoo bottle had been half used, and the non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke.It was convenient to get to my locations, and inexpensive, but that is where the benefits lay. The person at the front desk was obviously there just doing her job. Breakfast was decent for continental."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My daughter-in-law and I spent one night in a room with 2 doubles. We requested a room close to my sister and niece, and they gave us one next door. Everything worked. We were comfortable and had no complaints, except that they forgot to put the coffee maker in our room. However, the other room had one, and we enjoyed a good continental breakfast."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"If all you need is a bed late at night and nothing else, this is fine. And the internet signal was good. Rooms and bedsheets are feather worn and old. Bed not really comfy, but I was there just for a quick stop before a 7 AM flight so saw no other amenities"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Location was perfect for me, near the airport.  Everyone was nice and polite, but the room itself......my skin itched for 2 days after I left the motel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My room was dirty. The carpet was stained and the tile was cracked and dirty. The toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm......the maintenance didn't come to fix it until 10 am the next day. Also, the phone in my room did NOT work. I won't be staying there again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I recomemd everyone to visit sometime!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I was very disappointed for the cost of this room for one night. The walls and bathroom were dirty and the entire building had a dirty smell.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Very outdated and rundown. The Light Between the two beds Accord had a short in it and sparked and blew out when I turned it on outside was very Rundown. On my return trip I am staying in the same area but refused to go back there definitely not worth what I paid for it
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"You know... I read the reviews and was worried about staying there. I was there for 7 hours and my room was clean, didn't smell, and was comfortable.They lady that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nice location for night stay with good comfort and recommendable to friends
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We had holes in our towels and bed sheets. Also the ""free wifi"" was so spotty that we couldn't even use it. Would not recommend."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good place to rest. Appreciate friendly staff.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was fine, room was reasonably clean, beds were comfortable. We had a microwave and a coffee maker. We were there to get an early start on a triathlon the following day, so we were really not looking for anything beyond a reasonably clean place to crash. The staff were very nice, for a budget Hotel that caters to folks not concerned with amenities, it was fine and I would stay again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"7/10, �� cause du prix, mais ca vallait le coup malgr�� tout. Acceptable"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was terrible that i left next day even when i paid for the next day, and i didnt get a refund"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We stayed at this hotel December 2012. The hotel was easy to find and was located on the same road as a Denny's and gas stations. The room very large and clean. The lady at the front desk was friendly and professional. The only downside was the room's heat was off when we walked in and it was FREEZING. The heat worked great though.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"For an inexpensive hotel, it was fine. Rooms were reasonably clean although there were cigarette burn holes in the comforter. The blankets were really thin so I recommend asking for an extra one. But for the price- which is one of the cheapest in the area- it was fine."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"we stayed here because the price was right and it advertised a pool. The pool was ""under construction"" and hadn't been in service all season. The rooms smelled musty and the smell of smoke permeated the hallways (even in the non-smoking areas)"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Bathrooms were clean. Bed blankets need more frequent washing. Great price and location on our trip route. Breakfast had the basics. Could use two waffle makers.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,At first sight was a little taken aback as it looked like it was abandoned. After checking in we discovered that it was very clean and the room was very clean and spacious. Also very quite. The hotel staff was very helpful and nice
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was late in looking for a hotel near my son's college for family weekend, so my search was narrowed down to about 8 hotels a half an hour away.  I read the reviews and this seemed to receive the best comments.  We found the hotel to be clean and fine for our purposes, which was basically somewhere to watch tv after dinner and go to sleep. The bathroom was somewhat outdated but clean. The front office staff was great- the first night we were greeted warmly by the young woman, and my checkout was handled efficiently by the gentleman at the desk the next morning.  There were a number of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner.  We even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel the next time because we were able to save so much more money than if we had stayed at an overpriced motel closer to the college!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was your basic motel.  Clean overall with most things updated.  It's clearly an old Hojos which has been renovated so is it perfect?  No.  Is it better than the average motel?  Yup.  Worth the money.  Staff was very nice or the person who was there the night I arrived.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel and our room was a little run down... You can see that it was old and needed some tlc. However, the location was great in a nice neighborhood and not to far from Woodbury Common outlet malls or Poughkeepsie galleria mall which was our purpose for this trip!The hotel and room were clean.I wold stay again because for the price and location it was worth it!What made the difference was the staff.We got there late on Saturday evening and there were people ahead of us. A young woman said hello, told us it wouldn't be to long and next thing we knew we were already in our room. The breakfast was OK ""make your own waffles was great"" and the morning staff was nice. A young man even made some jokes with us while he was cleaning up and organizing the breakfast bar. At night we had ordered take out with a bottle of wine. The young lady at reception allowed us to use the microwave and opened the lights for us, got us plates, forks and napkins as well as a bottle opener. I also asked for extra towels and she handed them to me with a big smile. Check out was fast and friendly as well.Every employee we encountered at this hotel seemed as though they were the ones who owned it!!!I've got to say getting such great service at a budget hotel is rare and this crew made our stay more then enjoyable."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It is not an expensive place to stay for the night while away for work. Easy to miss the place at night since the big sign in front was not lit.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nice staff but Old facilities.  Obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"the room was clean. Breakfast was ok. I think they should have some piece of bread for toast also and maybe some salt and pepper to put on the cream cheese as not everybody likes ONLY sweet in the morning. The front desk Lady was nice and helpful.My only conplaint is the very outdated TV and bathroom. Especally the bathtub/shower.Even when I stayed in a hotel in India, they had a LCD tv in all of the hotels I stayed in. Nobody has these old Tv's anymore.I think the Manager or the Owner should at least once in a while walk into all of the rooms and check out the bathrooms. the bathtub is so old and the wall around the bathtub is so outdated and ""ugly"" that it is long overdue for an update."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Quick trip to Newburgh to visit a local motorcycle museum, the HoJo was close and convenient. Nice place to stay for a reasonable price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Ok
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Cold night, heater wasn't very good. Balcony is a good idea for smokers, so when you are below, watch out. A cigarette just might come flying past you. Saw another review months earlier about the back door not locking, well it still does not. No card needed. Breakfast was about what you'd expect. Woman at the front desk was very... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,oude troep. tapijt ligt los. gangen en hallen ����n grote dump. het is allemaal maar n��t schoon. durf niet met blote voeten in de kamer te lopen
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Woke up to no hot water for a shower. I don't know if this is because the hotel is old or because I got up early to catch an early morning flight, but regardless, PEOPLE NEED AT LEAST A WARM SHOWER in the morning! Is that too much to ask?"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"There was no hot water in our room and we had to walk down the hall to another room to take a shower. The hot water was then fixed in our room so we could shower the next morning.We were given fresh towels for the next day however, our beds were never made, the waste baskets were never emptied and the dirty towels were left on the floor. We discovered that the clocks in both of the rooms were off time."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,the price is right.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I rated this hotel okay overall because the staff were so friendly but it is really only okay if you are not fussy about cleanliness. The public areas were well maintained but when I arrived I discovered that the toilet seat was up and the water in the toilet was yellow. And the tub faucet leaked. Worst of all, the water from the faucet forced up the liner on the bottom of the tub, revealing a thick layer of black and white muck. Would I stay here again? Probably, because the price was right. But first I would look around to see what else was available.Here's a plus--out the window from the room, I saw a gopher up close and a rabbit across the way. Not bad, considering the proximity to the highway."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel itself was dirty and smelled like cat pee... The rooms are large but with a musky smell that sticks to the cloths and the bathroom were filthy with water stains all over the tub. On the other hand... The staff was very welcoming and friendly ... The front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see... More
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This location is easy access to the highway and the outlet location.  Lots of restaurants to choose from, breakfast included, fridge and mircowave in the room.  Very friendly staff."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Poorly maintained. Needs carpet replaced. Towels are old and worn out. Bathroom needs updating. Smells old.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Everyone was very nice and helpfull. Great free breakfast: Belgion waffles, breads, cereals, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea, milk and juice. Fruit and coffee available during day. They were painting while I was there. Comfortable room. Tub drained a bit slow and toliet plugged up once...Mantanience came right up to unplug it. If I was in the area I would gladly stay here again. Within walking distance to Chili's, Neptune Diner (very good), Barnes & Noble and close to interstates. Free internet access."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I don't know where those other folks stayed but our room was clean & comfortable. We didn't use the pool or anything else. The continental breakfast was nothing special, but if you expect Eggs Benedict cooked by a chef in a big white hat,go someplace more expensive!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Room Was very large and clean, room was already warm when we go there because it was so cold outside."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel means relax and comfort and accomplish your trip what u are out for .. If u don't get that facilities than it become worse personally and professionally
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The Hotel is a bit dated. Room was large. TV was a conventional tube model. Cable TV but the broadcast networks were fuzzy. The king size bed was okay. The mattress was firm on the edges but saggy in the middle. It sloped down towards that middle. If you rolled over, you kept going until you hit the hill on... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Das Hotel ist ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen, ist aber vergleichsweise im Rahmen dieser Preisklasse gut zu nutzen."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Service was great. It was simple and clean. The continental breakfast was indeed small. But not important. There are several restaurants right down the road and an Indian restaurant across the street. There is also a 24/7 wal-mart down the road as well.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We made late reservations through hotels.com and arrived 30 minutes later.  After checking in, we took our bags to our room only to discover that it had a strong cigarette odor, even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room.  The desk clerk made a quick change and we were off to another room, which smelled much better.The bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well.  Breakfast was sufficient, including cereal, bagels and English muffins, and a waffle maker.While we weren't there long enough to check out the other amenities, it was good for a road trip stop."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Staff were nice and helpful, room was not super clean. No elevator, and our room was on the second floor. Bed sagged in the middle, causing my wife and I to constantly roll to the middle. The sewer backed up into our toilet causing raw sewage to go on bathroom floor. Hotel did send up maintence promptly. Were gone all day, when we returned the problem was fixed but the room still smelled, so they gave us a new one. In a pinch I suppose it's ok, the staff were good at least, but I'll prob never use them again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,no refrigerator in the room. the entire property smelled like cigarettes.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It is an old Howard Johnson's for sure. Old TV, old mattresses, no frig. Convenient location and cheaper than all the newer hotels in the area. Good restaurant/lounge you can walk to."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel location was ok, the room was clean, and staff was friendly.The bed was not very comfortable. The room was not very modern..old appliances if any. The staff was not very helpful.I would not stay there again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The pool, which I had counted on, was closed."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Une nuit arriver a 11:00 le soir tres bien servi et tres bon service !!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hallways were dingy and smelled. The room was dirty. The windows were dirty. There were cobwebs near the heater/ac. The towel rack was missing a screw and one corner was completely detached from the wall. Some of the lights did not work. The toilet clogged because of paper. The manager that night said there was not staff available to help and gave us a plunger so we could take care of it ourselves. There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine. We were glad we were staying only for one night. It's a low-budget hotel and I did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics. However, cleanliness and customer service are a must. I will not be staying at any Howard Johnsons in the future."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This hotel was a good value but nothing special. The continental breakfast was a dissapointment and the bathroom was not as clean as I would have preferred. Staff was helpful
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel is located right off of Interstate 84. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to West Point.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,nice quiet place to stay rooms were clean staff was friendly i would come back and stay again
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I've stayed at a lot of hotels, some were real dumps (I won't tell you how bad, just say blood was found). Anyway, this place was little outdated, but was very clean. The king bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good. The staff wasn't the friendliest, but I'd rather have good food. Also, it is not located in a bad part of town, just a little noise from traffic. I would highly recommend if you get good price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Kind of low rent - you get what you pay for.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was clean and I felt safe.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was adequate for my needs.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"First I was uncomfortable with lady at front desk making copies of my ID and credit card, walked into room and the carpet was old smelly and a huge iron print mark burn in the carpet, after settling in I turned on television realized that remote required to batteries later on went to use bathroom will forward pictures do you may review and I will wait for your opinion."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We had to check into Fairfield Marriot, because the Howard Johnson hotel was in poor condition with cigarette smoke. My wife and child are ashmatic and this could result in health problems."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"DO NOT GO THERE.THIS PLACE IS OLD AND TIRED. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP WHEN I WAS CHECKING IN, ANOTHER COUPLE CHECKING OUT DEMANDED TO CONTACT THE MANAGER."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The entire facility is extremely run down and in desperate need of updating from the ground up. The hallways are very poorly lit and dirty. The rooms reek of cigarettes (tobacco and otherwise), the heating and cooling units don't work and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open. The TV only had one channel and the wifi is painfully slow. The only reason I stayed after seeing the room was I was tired and didn't feel like finding another hotel last minute. Definitely not worth any price to stay here."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Most aspects were fine, but the carpeting in our room desperately needed to be ripped out & changed. It had a perfect impression of an iron in it & the edges were full of dust, etc., indicating it had not been vacuumed thoroughly for some time."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was OK I would give it a C-. Place needs work. I probably would not use that hotel again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The stay was nice simple breakfast, nice room, short drive to train, close eating places, close to expressway"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The location was great but when I arrived it was hard to tell if they were open. The room had cobwebs on the furniture. The bed was very comfortable.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel velho, atendimento do check-in muito ruim, pessoas pouco gentis. Decepcionante."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel was pretty cheap, that was nice.  It's a bit run down, with a smell that suggests smoking was once allowed anywhere (or they have air circulation from smoker's section).  The water was brown, but that may have been due to some work going on in the town, I'm not sure."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel pictures on-line are better than ""in person.""  Rooms are old, breakfast was included and very average. Convenient location near two major highways."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel pictures on-line are better than ""in person.""  Rooms are old, breakfast was included and very average. Convenient location near two major highways."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The interior corridors are showing their age, as well as the non functional pool and tennis court. However I was there for a place to sleep between work days. The rooms were quiet, spacious and very comfortable. The mattresses and pillows on the bed were superior to the Marriott I stayed in the week before in Virginia."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. The hotel room was dirty and the bathroom was dirty. I had to go to WalMart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom. The floor was not washed by the hotel staff. The carpet was not vacuumed. There was dust and dirt in every corner. The bed was like plywood. The back entrance outdoor lights were not on until I requested that the be put on. The complimentary breakfast consisted of juice from a dispenser, fruit, yankee doodles and honey buns in a package. The hotel location was good for us but I won't stay there again because of the lack of cleanliness, safety issue with the outside lights not on at night and the lack of customer service by the staff."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Great location wasn't on site long I just needed and in-door pool to give my son something to do that evening..
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The desk person call me a name among other things she said to me. Profanity. TV renite did not work, they could not send anyone and she expected me to get dresses at 10 PM and change rooms by going to the main desk and getting new keys. Never go there as it could be dangerous to your health."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I would only stay the hotel if it was the last hotel in the city. It was smelly and old. The lobby is nothing like the hotel itself. I took alot of items with me daily just because the hotel was so rundown and I didnt trust it. If your looking for just somewhere to sleep because you have no other choice then go here. But if you want to enjoy sleep and feel comfotable in where your staying at night I wouldnt stay here.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,will be back with 14 members of my family next year!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Staff were very pleasant it worked out great for me conveniently located to Stewart airport nice area conveniently located to the Woodbury Commons great shopping area food was great in the area very close to 87 they New York State Thruway over all excellent deal for the money
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Very good housekeeping staff. Room was exceptionally clean compared to many more expensive hotels. Not so impressed with the maintenance staff. Numerous small problems (e.g. shower curtain rod lose, shower nozzle sconce hanging loose, constant heavy drip from bathtub nozzle, etc.) that could/should have been attended to prior to checking in."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Sheets had ink stains, shower was difficult to operate, towels were threadbare, fight in lobby woke us up, breakfast was stale, beds are tiny."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The room had dead bees and flies in front of the patio door.I noticed several carpenter ants in the carpet !!!!!!The room did not have a fridge very disappointed !!!!!!!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The room was good enough for my purpose.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Two of the three hotel staff I interacted with were not professional in their appearance; neither did they interact with me in a way that affirmed that I was a human being or a welcome customer. (One staff member was good though.) From what I could see, the room-cleaning staff does the best they can with what they have. The rate charged for the room was attractive but the savings comes at a different cost. This hotel really ""needs that special something."""
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"bed was very uncomfortable and when I took down the sheets there was food crumbs on top of the sheet, So I'm guessing who ever made the bed last enjoyed their snack on the bed and then made it. Also one of the sheets was full of holes."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I must say, I really had much higher expectations for the hotel. Once I got to my room, I noticed how outdated the whole place was. Also, the place smelled like orange cleaner that was masking a funky odor. Honestly, it felt like I was at a nasty roadside motel. I will say most of the staff was somewhat pleasant. If given the choice, I would of rather stayed on a couch at a relatives house."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"As you walk down the hallway towards your room, there is a powerful smell of something they are using to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel.  My room was non smoking, I think that just for the 3 nights I was there.  Areas of no paint on the bathroom walls, holes in the wall, globs of yellow ancient chalking around the toilet bottom.  The shower leaked, drip, drip, drip.  No maid service my second night.  A sticker on the bathroom door from a previous guest.  I woke up in the middle of the night all stuffed up from the noxious air.  I had to kept the air conditioning on all night.  There was a thick layer of dust on the tv console.  The facecloth was like sandpaper.  The towels didn't absorb water...I don't know what they were made of.  If I had paid forty a night I would expect what I got.  This is a one star folks!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was very disappointed in the fact that I booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren. When traveling 8 hours I wanted them to be able to relax and enjoy the pool - only to get there and the pool was closed and not working. If that was on the description I would not have booked it - I would have gone somewhere else. Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling, Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points. I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there. Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"updates to furniture, flooring etc"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Things broken or not working in room...staff offered to fix but never did. I had them move me to a different room, more things broke."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Staff was great, The rooms have been completley updated since my last stay the room smelled fresh and clean and they even put in all new carpeting. Would definitely stay again! The place is looking great!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I ended up here because there were no other options for a no smoking room. Upon arrival, the toilet had been used and not completely flushed. The bathroom was old and badly in need of repair. The second day ( Had I not been locked into Expedia, there wouldn't have been a second day!!!!) there was garbage by the garbage can that hadn't been removed. The entire room felt dirty. I will never stay at another Howard Johnson or use Expedia again. This experience was horrible."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"TV's are quite old and kind of unbearable to watch. The beds are not the softest and I had trouble sleeping through the night as a side sleeper. The hotel certainly does not look like the pictures provided. The tennis court is dilapidated and growing trees but overall the room was exactly what I expected for the price.  The breakfast was bearable as juices were provided (more fruit flavored sugar concoctions- in fact i am 99% certain the orange juice was strongly mixed tang), a waffle maker, coffee, and prepackaged pastries like danishes got the job done for me."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Did the job. I slept well enough & ate a good breakfast. Front desk lady was friendly, but couldn't check anybody in at first- took about 30 minutes for her to get the computer working. The price was reasonable, so I tempered my expectations. Outwardly, the hotel appeared clean & decently maintained however, once we entered the room there was an unpleasant odor and a closer look showed the room could have been a bit cleaner. For the price I was satisfied however."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The Hot water boiler went out, Cold showers in February Burrrr."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Reserved a room with a single bed, but those rooms were all sold and I had to stay in one with two double beds. Desk clerk was unconcerned ""nothing I can do"". Breakfast was terrible."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed at this hotel because it was the most economical in the region. Room was spacious and comfortable.  Bed sheets were not fitted well and were scratchy along with towels.  FO the proce, it was what I expected - practical and clean."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,hiuhj
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The tub and bathroom were very old and not really clean. The non-smoking room smelled like smoke. The screen door to the parking lot barely locked. Everything smelled musty in the room. Would never stay at a Howard Johnson again if this is the quality. And the worse part is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Door to outside of hotel had broken locks with a sign that said ""lock broken, push to open"" posted on it. Tub faucet leaked profusely. Room was clean and staff was very helpful and friendly."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Door to outside of hotel had broken locks with a sign that said ""lock broken, push to open"" posted on it. Tub faucet leaked profusely. Room was clean and staff was very helpful and friendly."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Propret�� moyen sur hors des chambre, d��jeuner le minimum, personnel pas recevant."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I never made it to the room. There were customers in the lobby complaining and being refunded. Signs in the lobby about cash transactions and age restrictions made the hotel seem a little dicey. Finally, there was a skunk at the front door and a rat at the back. The staff member said ""I can't believe we don't have the phone number for Animal Control with all of the wild dogs and cats out back"". Thankfully, I was told I would not be charged. I SLEPT IN MY VEHICLE IN A REST STOP. Felt safer in a rest stop on Interstate 87 than I did any where near that hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I had a very restful weekend. All the appliances (tv, iron, hair dryer, microwave, refrigerator, and lights were in good working order. My bed spread had a small dark stain on it so I showed it to the housekeeper. She apologized and immediately changed it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,very comfortable
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Great
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This location is very dated and in need of significant upgrades. First floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot. I didn't feel very safe at all. The room had a funky odor and I just didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings. With the exception of the bathroom, it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices. Also the table and chairs were very crammed in the room. I am a small person and had a very difficult time sitting at the table and trying to do work at the table.  I wouldn't have stayed here based on previous comments, but I needed a room for one night and this was about all that was available. I honestly was tempted to sleep in my car."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel was quite clean and the staff was very friendly. My only issue was that the ice machine wasn't working but that's not a big deal.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel threw away my special shoe horn to my $150.00 dress shoes that was purchased 2 weeks ago.They also discarded the special hat filler to use for flying as to not to crush my new hat purchased 4 weeks ago when cleaning the room.They did say they were sorry, but did not take any discount or reimbursement for these items. I would suggest they use a little more care for personal items."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The worst check out Tuesday went to a different Hotel
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We found the Hotel to be an old antiquated Howard Johnson. It backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the night in the rooms facing the highway which we were in. The doors need to be replaced through out the hotel, wiring runs haphazardly over the roofs, and the bathtub had cracks from old age. No refrigerators in the rooms which we missed. The hotel is being repainted and seems to be a work in motion. Morning breakfast was limited, no yogurt."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Room was not very clean..needed vacuuming.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Only stayed a night while in town for a funeral. Older property, but priced right. Staff very nice and room clean."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This was the most horrible hotel I have ever stayed in. First of all the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and my friend. Once we got our room we heard someone outside our door about an hour later I looked the peep hole and the man from the front desk was looking inside our peep hole!! I was so freaked out I kept checking it all night I was even too scared to leave through the front door the next day. I originally planned to stay 2 nights but was so disgusted that I booked a different hotel the next night! Do not stay there especially if you're a young female!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Rooms and the entire hotel is just... ok. Nothing really exciting but nothing too bad also. Not a lot of choice for breakfast. The tv in the breakfast area was really loud. We sleeped here because we wanted to split the trip in two parts and we didn't want an expensive hotel as we were there only to get a rest before continuing our trip.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was traveling with my grandchildren, so I choose this hotel because it had an outdoor pool. Upon arrival, I saw the pool had no water, greatly disappointing my grandkids. Upon check-in, I waited while the woman at the desk finished her personal call. When commenting on the pool, she still didn't even look up and her response was a shrug and off-the-cuff comment, ""the pool had a leak"". Not even an apology or smile. She then asked if I wanted to go elsewhere. I replied that I had prepaid through Hotels.com and got another shrug. This was the good part of the stay. The room was large, but the bedspeads were dirty and sliding door disgusting with a makeshift drilled hole with a screw instead of a lock. The wallpaper was patched and horribly peeling in the bathroom. The bathroom was dirty as well, especially the floor. Thank goodness the stay was only overnight."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"For the price ,the service is reasonable. The breakfast coffee was the bast ever experiences ."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,chambre propre et confortable avec micro ondes et frigo - centre commercial proche - petit d��jeuner correct
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Checked in Friday night, wanted to sleep in but was awaken by fire alarm system at 8 am, took fire department 30 minutes to shut off, false alarm. I was in town for a funeral Sunday and Monday. Saturday night I was awaken at 2:30 am by a wedding party that booked rooms side by side my room while they were drinking and talking loudly in the hallwaymoutside my room door, at least a dozen of them. I called the front desk for someone to tell them to go to their rooms, nothing happened , so after 30 minutes I got up and asked them please to keep it down. Old hotel, not much of a continental breakfast, old sheets and bedding, stiff mattresses, paid less from other motels and got better in past, but most places in area are over $100 a night, I booked for 4 night, better to pay over a $100 a night a get a quieter more comfortable bed."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel was nicer than I expected for the price, nothing fancy but clean, roomy, comfortable and in a convenient location. Our only complaint was that the breakfast buffet area was set up in an inefficient arrangement which made it difficult for more than a couple of customers to access it at one time. The person restocking the buffet was somewhat rude, and she was coughing on the food. There were very few tables and chairs even though the breakfast area was quite large.I would also request that this and other motels not use scented cleaning products or air fresheners. Many of us are sensitive to these odors."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We made a reservation for 2 adults + 3 children for a suite with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room.There were only 2 double beds and no leaving room, no extra sofa for my child. we had to re-allocate to a different hotel after midnight!In the pictures I could see the leaving room and the extra sofa... far from reality...The first receptionist sent me to talk with Expedia were I made the reservation... imagine, it was @ 23:30, with 3 kids during a very late check-in after I verified late check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier.disappointment."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Stayed for three nights.  Wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was a comfortable stay minus the maid walking in twice before checkout
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The staff is very nice and helpful - We asked for help for our next day schedule in Syracuse (300 miles away) and the hotel keeper took her own time on the computer to help us.  Many thanks!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not a good experience.  The heater was old and beat up;  Bathroom floor slippery  and water flow weak;  no extra electric outlets; had to unplugged something to charge my phone and use my computer.And the best:  I ask for a receipt when checking out; two people told me they could not give me a receipt even though there was a sign that said ""ask for a receipt when checking out""  They said I could not get a receipt because it was prepaid.  In short; there are other hotels around the area there; go to one of them not Howard Johnson's"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Had a wonderful stay there. Being I just stayed at the Poughkeepsie Inn and that was a nightmare!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The rooms looked good but there were cob-webs in the ceiling and the sheets were so old and crushed it was as if the beds weren't freshly made
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We are not picky people, having traveled repeatedly to third world countries, but this place really was bad. The hallway and lobby smelled horrible. There was no one at the desk when I tried to check-in. Eventually the clerk came in with her coat on since she had been outside smoking. There was only one luggage cart and no elevator, which wasn't a huge deal but they don't tell you that. The hotel was in need of SERIOUS remodeling and maintenance. Breakfast consisted of store-bought donuts and bagels, even the coffee was out. Housekeeping walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing. The entire experience was bad and we would NEVER stay here again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"fair, but they woke us up at 5:27 and we did not ask for that. Also the beds were nery hard."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The staff are very nice and the location was convenient to highways and restaurants; however the hallways and rooms were dirty.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It's an older property with no frills and dated looks. But, flat screen TV in the room, a free continental breakfast and WiFi (did not use WiFi so cannot comment on functionality). The staff was very friendly and helpful, and greated us with a smile! What this hotel lacks in frills it makes up for with friendly staff and low... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Bathroom needed help. Breakfast was satisfcatory.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We had drove by the hotel our first try finding the hotel as the sign was partially hidden by a tree. We called the number supplied for the hotel,  was given directions from where we were. We paid closer attention second drive through, noticing the sign this time.  Checking in was pleasant and was given directions on where we could park and which door was best to enter to get to our room. The room was set up in a pleasant manor, with a king size bed. The continental breakfast was very good, with cereal, muffins, waffles, coffie, juice, bagels, and fruit available."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"location was ok, clean room, but the front desk staff was horrible, bad attitude!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,No towels. No hot water not enough pillows. Ice machine out of service on my floor
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,older hotel & room; water not in pool; are in middle of renovating. Lobby & breakfast area nice but the room itself is below par.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Old but clean and comfortable. The sheets and towels had holes in them, but, the room was (and smelled) clean."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Older hotel hallways and rooms. Clean with comfy bed. Nice lobby and breakfast area nice enough. Needs updating like doors on rooms and bath fixtures. Saw a beaver or possum type animal outside going under cement slab outside glass patio doors during early daylight evening hours.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel felt dark and creepy. The rooms were painted very sloppily. It had a Smell, and we didn't get a room cleaning every day. Ran out of clean towels and cups."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,King size bed needs a new mattress. My wife & I sunk to the middle of the bed & I could not sleep. Otherwise room was ok & continental breakfast was ok
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel needed updating - very old. The toilet was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger. Did have a nice balcony though.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not that you expect a lot from Howard Johnson hotels, but this one was filthy. There was an iron left on the floor too long that held melted the carpet and was never fixed haha. But worse off it felt unclean. The bed was itchy and my travel buddy and I woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies. We suspect it was bed bugs, but didn't decide to stay around to find out. Checked out of there. Do not recommend at all. You can do better. Like sleeping in your car or under a tree."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The price was very good, good restaurants nearby. No refrig though. Overall not bad for the money. We wouldstay there again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,i stay at this hotel when I am on my business trips the hotel is clean and comfortableand the service is OK it has Plenty of restaurants around it and there is a mall right around The corner.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The entire facility is extremely run down and in desperate need of updating from the ground up. The hallways are very poorly lit and dirty. The rooms reek of cigarettes (tobacco and otherwise), the heating and cooling units don't work and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open. The TV only had one channel and the wifi is painfully slow. The only reason I stayed after seeing the room was I was tired and didn't feel like finding another hotel last minute. Definitely not worth any price to stay here."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel looked great from the outside. Some of the rooms have been updated but the hotel is old and tired. There is an odor upon entering the room part of the hotel. Lobby is new and very attractive but monies were not spent on the rest of the place. Had a leak in shower, told front desk, person came up and said, ""I see you have a leak"" and then left. We still had leak. This seems to be the attitude in maintaining this hotel."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,not recomnded

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Other than location, this hotel should be relisted as a motel....The outside has a Hilton look until you go inside the smoked filled lobby and realize there is no turning back!We stayed in room 204 and found the fitted sheets covered in hair. There are some things we are able to overlook but the hair on the sheets was a bit much for us.I hope this hotel is up for renovation soon."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Staff was pleasant at desk and serving continental breakfast. Major issue with filthy looking carpeting throughout, poorly vacuumed in our room, We couldn't get an extra towel, and the ones they do supply are small and very worn. Back door doesn't close properly- lack of security. Only one working ice machine (not on our floor). Motel is dated, but they could do a much better job. Poor ownership/management."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"You were NOT given any room key at check in, just a room number and a wi-fi code - their entire key system was broken.  If you ever left your room [ I traveled solo ], you had to have the clerk let you back in your room.  THIS IS WAY BELOW ACCEPTABLE and made leaving the room a HASSLE.  I used Expedia's no refund, lowest price option and felt trapped at check-in, when I found out, for the first time in my 65 years that the entire hotel's lock system was broken.  Live and learn.  I will NEVER use the no refund option again - How would you like it if YOU checked into a hotel and were NOT even give a room key, since they wouldn't even work.  I'd rate this a ZERO!  As other's review this hotel, it would be nice if Expedia would warn those who booked a room in advance that there is a major problem at a Hotel - naturally that did not happen - the problem, I found out too late, existed 5 days prior to my arrival.  A refund would be in order.............. this was an upsetting Hotel experience.   Howard Johnson's,  newburgh, ny - 2/5/17."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Old outdated motel. The continental breakfast was nothing to talk about. We ate at a different location for breakfast the next day. The room ac was very noisey. Would not stay there again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We were not there much except to sleep. The rooms smelled of smoke and needed to be updated.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Check in was a nightmare. 3 sets of keys before they decided to change our room. The room was clean but tired.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Upon entrance to our room we were greeted by the smell of dank, moldy carpet. There were large mysterious stains on the carpet, chair and walls but nothing compares to the hairs we found on the toilet. It was the most unequivocally, disgusting place I have EVER been!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We stopped off here on a long journey to North Carolina. The room was clean and had everything we needed.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We only stayed one night and the room was clean and comfortable. Howard Johnson is the only hotel chain (and we have stayed in many other hotels)that allows their guests to open the room window or patio doors. I wish the sliding door of our room would have been in its frame and not hanging away from the frame so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room. It was a lovely night to have the door open.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues. However, this time when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell.. As of they were trying to mask the smell. There were bugs crawling on the table, I awoke one morning to a huge spider on my pillow looking at me and lastly.. The bathroom had tiny hairs on floor and shower wall. Was truely disgusted with my stay!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new hotel accross the road...its disgusting
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was a nice stay. Would go to it again, the complimentary breakfast was pretty awesome"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Front desk was very pleasant and informative. Even housekeeping on the floor I was on were pleasant and asked if everything was o.k. My only complaint was googlemaps gave wrong directions and the good was the front desk got me back. Great location and great price for what I needed. Thank you. I was happy
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Our first room was freezing despite the heat being on full blast. Finally, we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room.  The new room was warm, but nothing special.  The coffee maker made lukewarm water. There was no computer jack. Plus, because the closed down a wing, you couldn't get the lobby without going outside.  It was freezing! So bring your snow shoes if want the complimentary breakfast."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hallways were dingy and smelled.  The room was dirty.  The windows were dirty.  There were cobwebs near the heater/ac.  The towel rack was missing a screw and one corner was completely detached from the wall.  Some of the lights did not work.  The toilet clogged because of paper.  The manager that night said there was not staff available to help and gave us a plunger so we could take care of it ourselves.  There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine.  We were glad we were staying only for one night. It's a low-budget hotel and I did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics.  However, cleanliness and customer service are a must.  I will not be staying at any Howard Johnsons in the future."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Dirty. Shower floor not cleaned. Whole room was barely cleaned. Sliding door to the patio looks at the parking lot and did not lock. Windows and chairs sticky. Not enough towels for 2. Would never stay at a Howard Johnson motel again. The breakfast was just ok. They didn't even have bagels. Nope, never a HoJo on any future road trips. I will stick to the clean and neat comfort inns and only pay one third the price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Everything was A OK. It's a HoJo so nothing to rave about but actually better than I expected. Good place to stop for the night on your way somewhere.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was a cheap enough night, the hotel itself feels like it was last updated in the '70s. Right across the highway from Orange County Choppers."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was a cheap enough night, the hotel itself feels like it was last updated in the '70s. Right across the highway from Orange County Choppers."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We come here yearly for several years now for our shopping woodbury i have seen this place deteriorating overall. The staff, mostly the ones present in the dining area for breakfast just made me rate them low overall. we're not coming back not recommending it to anyone."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Tr��s mauvais accueil.Chambre d��su��te, ameublement, tapis, pourtour de bain malpropre.Lors du petit d��jeuner, on nous as avit�� b��tement de quitter la salle pour faire de la place a d'autres clients alors qu'il y avait deux tables de libre."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We stayed at this hotel because it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be staying there again. The furniture was very outdated and uncomfortable, the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door. We were asked to leave our table at breakfast before we were done eating because there were only six tables to accommodate all their guests. We had been sitting there for only 15 minutes.  When I explained I wasn't finished the woman became very rude and snapped at me to finish. Really????"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was clean and the staff helpful & friendly. It had what I wanted a bed and a bathroom. The only thing I wished was better were the pillows - flat and very uncomfortable. The hotel has a pool, but it is never opened."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"not bad, however , we were without cable tv and internet for around a whole day when everything was shut and nothing to do, yes the country was under a natural disaster, but as guests of the hotel we had no other source of entertainment or means of communication with the outside world.... it should have been made top priorty when it occured"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"stay was good, bed a little hard, they need to put more shampoo in the bathroom. One small bottle for 3 women will not do. Breakfast needed a little help. otherwise, place was ok"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Front desk staff seemed bothered, No customer service at all. Hotel not in bad shape . Offer nothing in ammentities but still required credit card for incidentals. When I asked what type of incidentals could I incur I was told that ""you might damage the room or make phone calls! "" Really ? I was there on business and the way I was dressed certainly didn't look like I was there for a day rate. There were two of us and we had booked for 2 day's. I could see through the sheets on the bed and there were a few small holes also. When I took the pillows out of the cases to look at them I saw yellow sweat stains on all of them ! Towels I think were white at one time,now they seem to be a dull greyish color. In any event we spent about 45 minutes there and decided we could not stay. I returned the keys to the front desk . The attendant just took them never asked why or what was the problem, just said ok ! There are plenty of hotels in the area, four within walking distance from this one and at least 15 -20 within a 15 mile radius. I would make every effort to stay at any of them."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I liked the continental breakfast except they did not have any food that was protein. I cannot eat a lot of carbs.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,There was no hot water for an early morning shower. The heater in the room was very noisy and kept clicking on and off all night. The mattress on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"there is no reason why the entrances to the building are not vacuumed. The rooms are clean but the entrance can turn one off. Breakfast area is unorganized. bread on one side butter and jam on the other. The lady who watches the breakfast area doesn't wipe down the tables after people have eaten. There is alot of fresh food for breakfast, and it is good."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"While professional the desk attendant at sign in was not very friendly, the room was large and very clean, the upstairs ice machine did not work and I had to walk around half the place to find a working ice machine. Great place if you""re just for a place for the night to sleep."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Toilet seat was brokenbottom of outside of bath tub dirty
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed overnight here. Room was dirty, sheets stained, holes in them, etc.... Bathroom condition was tolerable. If I had paid one third this much I would have expected it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed overnight here. Room was dirty, sheets stained, holes in them, etc.... Bathroom condition was tolerable. If I had paid one third this much I would have expected it."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip. It was not worth the 118.00 price. Should have been more like a 59.00 per night charge.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"There are no special amenties to this hotel, but if you're just looking for a clean, nice place to spend the night, this is a good start."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,would have been better if the pool was open. great place to eat that is short walk.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel is conveniently located close to Stewart International Airport. The hotel sits off the street so road noise was not an issue. The staff I interacted with, especially Kirsten) was very friendly. The included continental breakfast was what you would expect. The remote for the TV did not work and I was provided with another one and instructions on how to program it. It didn't work either. The bathroom did not get the attention that most people would expect. It was dusty, and had hairs on the floor upon my arrival. When I returned at the end of the day after room service, they were still there. That could have been better. The price was decent, but I would shop the competitors before choosing to stay here again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed at the hotel for a convention and it was convenient, affordable and staff was very nice."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,OK but lobby was small with few tables to have continental breakfast;  unusual layout with parking lot in the back of the building.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bed was comfortable. Hotel was hard to find. Arrived in the dark after long airplane trip from west coast. Not enough identification or lights showing to see from highway easily. Had to stop and ask twice for directions & still almost missed it. It sits way back from the highway. Needs better signs. Room appeared clean, but there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments. Entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me with suitcase & other items. No sloping ramp to either rear entrance Parking was ample & hidden behind hotel, so privacy or fear of car break in was no issue. Good variety for continental breakfast, but no juices available to drink. Front desk service was exceptionally good both evening and morning. Very helpful. Complimentary computer service and printing assistance when I needed to print air travel boarding passes. I stayed 1 night on arrival & returned later for another night before early morning departure from Stewart International A/P. Overall satisfactory."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was good for the price,  good service we just used it to sleep,and it was goodcould have more cable chanels"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Very stale smelling hallway.... smoke... YUCH!Room had a lot of air freshener ... so much that it gagged you when you walked into the room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Salle de bain TR��S ordinaire . Nous n'y retournerons plus.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Services are niceRoom can be cleaner
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Howard Johnson Inn has nice rooms the best price in the area also is in a good location for dining and shopping.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Terrible breakfast. Bad coffee. Musty smelling room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Ok, in need of upgrades."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Seems like I have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area.  I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition.  Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint; it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper.  Then again, seems par for the course in that area."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We made a reservation for 2 adults + 3 children for a suite with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room. There were only 2 double beds and no leaving room, no extra sofa for my child. we had to re-allocate to a different hotel after midnight! In the pictures I could see the leaving room and the extra sofa... far from reality... The first receptionist sent me to talk with Expedia were I made the reservation... imagine, it was 23:30, with 3 kids during a very late check-in after I verified late check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier. disappointment."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The main lobby was lovely! The staff was great.... Can't say much for the rooms, looks like there was paint over damages that were never taken care of and the furniture needs major update and/taken care of. If the building could match the lobby, it would be wonderful."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Check in was quick and easy room was spotless. Heat worked great and bed was very comfortable. Close to lots of restaurants have no complaints would defiantly stay here again
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The rooms are a little old. The beds are nice. And it was warm, what else ya waht?    The staff was great. The front desk people were very helpful and friendly."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Both microwave and frig were provided in room which is very convenient. However, the room cleanness is questionable. A few pieces of long human hairs were under the bed cover and a dead bug was inside the icebox. Also, the toilet flash system was broken down. The breakfast didn't have any protein provided, which is kind of surprise and disappointed, e.g., no egg, sausage, nor bacon."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Good hotel. Staff was not helping me at all. They were rude. Room was clean. Good hotel in general.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,No CC for TV. I paid for one night and no CC on its TV? The staff people were rarely at the desk. I arrived and no one was there to assist me.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,hotel vieillot aurais besoin d un bon rafraissement. Tres pret de l autoroute donc assez bruyant . La chambre non fumeur sentait les vestiges d une chambre jadis fumeur. Par contre au petit dejeuner on peut se faire de vraies gauffres
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The rooms were clean, however it was not one of the 74 recently renovated rooms. The bathroom needed attention. The tub was cracked and the towel rack was falling off the wall. This was the 2nd room we had. The bathroom sink in the 1st room was clogged. The continental breakfast was very limited and I believe the owner's wife,... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel was decent for the price. The staff was very friendly and attentive.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Needs to do some serious renovations. The hotel smells like paint and smoke
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was late in looking for a hotel near my son's college for family weekend, so my search was narrowed down to about 8 hotels a half an hour away. I read the reviews and this seemed to receive the best comments. We found the hotel to be clean and fine for our purposes, which was basically somewhere to watch tv after dinner and go to sleep. The bathroom was somewhat outdated but clean. The front office staff was great- the first night we were greeted warmly by the young woman, and my checkout was handled efficiently by the gentleman at the desk the next morning. There were a number of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner. We even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel the next time because we were able to save so much more money than if we had stayed at an overpriced motel closer to the college!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Only stayed overnight clean room tube had some mold around seam that was only bad part front desk clerk was very friendly.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The swimming pool was out of service through out my whole stay (2 nights) . The bathroom got clogged 2 times

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Comfortable rooms, good staff, and good price. Lots of good food places around too. Can't forget the hotel breakfast in the morning too."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,ok. a convenient location. An old property that needs major renovations.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Needed a hotel for one night and found this hotel on line, close to my work. Thought it was a Howard Johnson, so it should be OK. Was I supprised when I checked in, very old structure that needs a lot of work. Bath tub had a liner installed over old unit and the shower head was not raised, it was chest high. Old standard round toilet with a very loose seat. The windows had not been cleaned in a long time. Air leaks around the sliding glass door, which I did not dare try and open. No frig so i looked for the ice machine, no signs, just walk around until you find it on the other end of the hotel and when you do locate it looks so bad you won't use any ice from it anyway."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Hotel means relax and comfort and accomplish your trip what u are out for .. If u don't get that facilities than it become worse personally and professionally
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Sur la route au retour de la Floride, a + ou - 4 hres du Quebec. Endroit pres des commodites, sur le bord de l'autoroute.Hotel un peu vieillot, mais chambre propre, lit confortable, tres correct."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was decent for the money. Totally cheap and toatlly acceptable. The staff is super friendly, helpful and nice. We found it to be safe and comfortable. Also free breakfast, the waffles are yummy, & the staff will bend over backwards trying to accomodate you!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Iliked this hotel. Even though it had a low rating I still decided I would stay here. In my opinion this is a nice place to stal. Next time in the area I will stay here.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I am a GM at a hotel in Ohio, and and originally from New York. I was afraid to stay here... There is no security, the staff is extremely unfriendly, the rooms are so old that the batteries in the remote were crusted over with white acid. I took it to the front desk and the night auditor made me... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,yes no problems clean very good area I was with my partner the check in clerk was funny and a pleasure to talk to I pay 80 for a weekend

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,OK pour une nuit
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"staff was friendly, one day our room was not cleaned or towels replaced but we found out they were short staffed.  Would be nice if they could extend their breakfast hours to 10:00, but it was OK.  Loved that we have a coffee maker and fridge in the room."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Personnel helpful , we got a good serviceThanks"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Didn't know if I was gonna like it cuz the outside looked a little beat up! But once I went inside the hallways and rooms are very clean and smell great..
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I have been staying in Newburgh area and this was by far the best one for the price. Well worth the stay
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We found the Hotel to be an old antiquated Howard Johnson. It backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the night in the rooms facing the highway which we were in. The doors need to be replaced through out the hotel,  wiring runs haphazardly over the roofs, and the bathtub had cracks from old age. No refrigerators in the rooms which we missed. The hotel is being repainted and seems to be a work in motion. Morning breakfast was limited, no yogurt."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Room smelled of smoke and door to outside (sliding door) lock was broken
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The nearby New York State Thruway is a factor. Heavy tractor trailer traffic all night long. Get a room away from the highway if you can. The mattresses are fairly hard and thin but serviceable.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,motel was in a good location for us. it was fairly quiet there. continental breakfast was enough for us.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"You get what you pay for there really are no frills, but then again you aren't paying for any."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We needed a room for one night while attending a concert in Marlboro and this fit the bill perfectly. Nothing fancy but our room was clean, the price was excellent, and the location was good too. The continental breakfast was fine, just what we needed before our drive home. It suited our needs and I would stay there again if... More"

When we asked to talked to a manager , she said he was not available. TRIP ADVISOR... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The pool was not available for use even though it was 85 degrees and Memorial Day weekend. The room was musty smelling even though we paid extra for a non-smoking room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The location is good, the hotel was clean, bed was comfortable with basic ammenities. The door passes were strictly for the entering your hotel room. I didn't like that anyone could get in through the back door, which is not typical of today's hotel security. Staff was available at 3PM but not before for check in. The price was right, so not much to complain about really."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was ok, they definitely need new towels."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,room was comfortable would like to see microwave or small fridge. Good stay!!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was okay, but the bathroom was absolutely dirty with hair in the tub. The sink was dirty and the towels turned black when I wet them."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The rooms appear to be recently refurbished. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern and the room was very clean, Convenient location, good price."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,This is the second time I have stayed at Howard Johnson. First time was better than this last time. This last time there was a candy wrapper on the floor near the window and a bobby pin in the bathroom when I walked in. Other than that the room was fine. I just need a bed and a shower and that is what is nice about it.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Traveling from DC to Lake Placid, so this hotel was conveniently located approx halfway. While I thought this was an inexpensive place to rest for one night, it ended up costing 20 more than posted on Hotels.com. I am not a finicky person when it comes to a place to sleep, but this hotel smelled very smokey and musty, and the door to my room was very difficult to open (had to kick it in each time I entered). Perhaps humidity or too many layers of paint or both. I would not choose to stay here again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was our favorite place to stay on our trip from Florida to NH. We were fortunate enough to get a handicap access room and it was just right. The room was set up so someone could use the table and the other person could actually get around. It was clean and the beds were very comfy. The free breakfast... More
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"In the morning, when my kids were eating breakfast and playing with their iPads, the service lady force my kids to leave their table. On the other hand, the service lady had a table by herself. I feel bad about her action."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was your basic motel. Clean overall with most things updated. It's clearly an old Hojos which has been renovated so is it perfect No. Is it better than the average motel Yup. Worth the money. Staff was very nice or the person who was there the night I arrived.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I found the Howard Johnson to be located in a conveniant location & I received the best value for my dollar.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Not very clean. Small towels. Bed was uncomfortable.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Front desk lobby counter was too high. Difficult to write and make transactions. But, honest folks work there. Someone found my credit card and turned it into a member of housekeeping staff who returned it to me. Now that's service!"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,You get what you pay for!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi. Only the coffee maker frame was there. Bathroom was in C grade condition.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Zimmer, gross ger��umig mit Terrasse, Aber die Leute im Hotel alle durchweg unfreundlich! Geben Sich keine M��he, Internet funktioniert in kaum einem Zimmer ��ber Fr��hst��ck brauchen wir nicht zu reden, die Bagels waren Abfallprodukte!! Total Ent��uscht vom rund um service."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I stayed here cause the rate was right but when that's said its all said The bed was very comfortable but the blankets were old and could have been Heavier since this was a Feb stay The heater didn't work very good. Probably needed to be upgraded (Old and worn out). it was very loud when on LOW setting The... More
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Staff neither gracious nor hostile: just there. But for $50, you're getting what you pay for. Room adequate -- it's got a bed and it's in the right location if this is where you need to be."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Desk clerk very helpful with directions
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Excellent cable, clean decent sized room, thumbs down continental breakfast. ZERO low or no sugar options, no yogurt or unsweetened oatmeal, no whole wheat anything... cheap English muffins and bagels, average coffee... no lemon option for tea. Only had Red Delicious apples and oranges - no other fruit. Juice machine with low quality reconstituted juices was a waste of water.... More"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We recently went upstate NY for fall foliage and stayed here for one night. I won't consider this as a great hotel but won't really it was horrible, either. We booked really late and the hotels around were at least $50-60 higher. Just for a few hours of sleep we wanted to give this a try. It worked out well without any complaint. For the price you are paying I would say this was absolutely reasonable. The location was fantastic and there are lots a of stores within a mile or so. Extremely convenient."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Since when has a hotel had smoking rooms? And why, having them, would the hotel put the smoking rooms next to non smoking rooms."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Would not stay at this hotel again. Unfriendly staff, smelly, ant infested, dirty rooms. No elevator...75 year old parents had to climb, with their luggage, up to second floor. Noisy"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I was very disappointed in the up keep of the motel and I believe the hotel had a contract with the local social services.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The hotel was not horrible for the price. The staff were very nice. My only complaint was that the beds were not very comfortable, but weren't horrible, and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well. We ended up having four rooms and had the same problem with all but one. The one we didn't have a problem with, got way to hot!!! But overall, I would probably stay here again if need be. We weren't in our rooms very much since we went to the city. Good place to stay when visiting someone from West Point."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Great staff.  Tv screwed down. No swivel. Aging hotel. Priced right online. Overpriced if obtained in lobby.  Breakfast ok.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Le lit ��tait confortable mais le chauffage ��tait trop fort dans la chambre et il y en avait pas dans les coridors. La salle de bain ��tait malpropre avec des cheveux de d'inconnus sur le rebord de la toillette et sur le plancher. L'employ�� qui nous a accueilli ne pouvait m��me pas nous garantir que l'eau du robinet ��tait potable. Insalubre comme chambre mais le batiment en tant que tel est ok.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Me, my fianc��e, our toddler and family friend all stayed a week in Newburgh at this hotel. We came to do visit family and spend most of our time in NYC. It was only an hour from the city. We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fianc��e. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,hotel is average but bad smell all over no proper ventilation or ac filtration system .

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was very nice and clean, hotel staff nice and friendly. Lots of restaurant in area. Arrive very late and had to leave by 6am to catch flight but will definitely will stay again."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We were totally disappointed . The room stunk especially the bathroom. Smelled soured. Everything was old and outdated and in need of repair. It did not feel clean. If we had not prepayed for this we would have moved to another motel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"A quick overnight at this location was pretty good value for the money. The hotel itself. Bathroom, again a little dated, but clean. I'd stay here again, looking to save a few bucks."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It wasn't great but tolerable. The sliding glass doors were a bonus, beds OK, sink separated from toilet and shower were appreciated but the shower looked disgusting (didn't use it)."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Looking from the road, the bldg looked closed. Don't be fooled. Very helpful n courteous staff. A little dated but very comfortable, quiet and clean."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nothing great, room was clean but not worth the cost they charged. 4 star cost at 2 star ratings. Was stuck in a jam for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed.  Room was clean but needs to be updated just like the rest of the hotel. Continental breakfast was very weak."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"My stay was pleasant, plenty of parking, the staff was helpful. The breakfast was disappointing, no much to choose from."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,the only reason i use this hotel is the location too bad they don't fix the place up because it's so close to west point and is convenient
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,���������������������������������������������������������������������������
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"I was very disappointed in the fact that I booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren.  When traveling 8 hours I wanted them to be able to relax and enjoy the pool - only to get there and the pool was closed and not working.  If that was on the description I would not have booked it - I would have gone somewhere else.  Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling,Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points.  I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there.  Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The rooms were very clean and the continental breakfast was excellent.The staff could use a more pleasant attitude, but we would still stay there again if in the area."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I had 2 items stolen from my room. It was a scary place. No apology or help in getting my belongings back. I wasn't offered compensation or anything. Parking lot was poorly lit and secluded. Very scary. Decor not updated in at least 15 years
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Old but clean and comfortable. The sheets and towels had holes in them, but, the room was (and smelled) clean."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"You know... I read the reviews and was worried about staying there. I was there for 7 hours and my room was clean, didn't smell, and was comfortable. They lady that checked me in was nice and got me to my room quickly."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I informed mgmnt of a backup of the 2 sinks in room 127. Apparrently they could not be fixed until roro rooter was needed.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"This hotel has not been kept up over the years. Rooms smell musty, cleanliness is an issue and hotel staff at breakfast not pleasant. sliding doors in our room did not lock which was a concern travelling with children. Very sketchy is how my children described the location."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Hotel etwas abseits gelegen, rel. gut isoliert (trotz Autobahnnähe), gutes continental breakfast, grosszügige Zimmer, gutes Bett. Preiswürdig."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The property is rundown and in disrepair. Towels are stained and the bathroom was moldy throughout. The bed linens were tissue paper thin and the pillows flimsy. The complex smelled of cheap air freshener throughout. The outer access doors were unlocked so there was no security. The bathroom sink was stopped up through our entire stay in spite of our request for a repair. The night clerk was uncooperative and confrontational. This is absolutely the worst hospitality experience that I have ever had. Do not stay here!
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Not a five star hotel but cheap for a weekend getaway
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,People were nice but the place needs serious renovation
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,The hotel was unpersonal and a little dirty. The staff was nice. The room was big and clean.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Iliked this hotel. Even though it had a low rating I still decided I would stay here. In my opinion this is a nice place to stal. Next time in the area I will stay here.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Fine for a overnight stay to rest.Just a little worn around the edges
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Room is ok for an overnight stay, but for anything longer, I would choose elsewhere.    The hotel is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for what you get."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Bathroom old and worn.. slippery shower mat in old tub.. moved mattress to do normal check for bugs, tons of old hair (body hair) .. no one has cleaned that area in a long time"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We stayed at this hotel because it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be staying there again. The furniture was very outdated and uncomfortable, the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door. We were asked to leave our table at breakfast before we were done eating because there were only six tables to accommodate all their guests. We had been sitting there for only 15 minutes. When I explained I wasn't finished the woman became very rude and snapped at me to finish. Really"
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Stayed two seperate nights, Sunday and Friday, midway point of trip.This hotel has obviously had a recent renovation and upgrade. Rooms were large, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room. No elevator, but first floor corridor is accessible from the lobby, no steps. NOTE 2: Restaurant next door is separate from hotel. Not recommended."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Tricky enterance during the weekday. Asked for a fridge and microwave oven, though they were in my room in advance of check in, the fridge quit working for 1 and a half days."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice clean quiet hotel.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Good value, decent breakfast, adult novelty store next door :-("
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Room is ok for an overnight stay, but for anything longer, I would choose elsewhere. The hotel is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for what you get."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Don't stay here go down the road to the super 8 or the days in only thing good was AC
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Nice room, great AC, frig and microwave. TV was very old and got only a few channels. Toilet leaked water. Power outlet by bed was wore out. Door lock on door was missing. Front desk is way too high . Front desk guy not the most friendyest person. Breakfast was basic but OK. Overall, a good room for a good price without alot of frills."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The Manager and staff were very friendly the rooms were very nice and the small mini breakfast was good as well, very happy with our stay and the price was right as well."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,It was comfortable
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Although the staff is friendly, this hotel is extremely outdated. Our room smelled horrible and the carpets were so filthy we were afraid to take off our shoes. The blankets and sheets had stains and were worn to the point of being see thru in places. In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business. Disgusting."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"We made late reservations through hotels.com and arrived 30 minutes later. After checking in, we took our bags to our room only to discover that it had a strong cigarette odor, even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room. The desk clerk made a quick change and we were off to another room, which smelled much better. The bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well. Breakfast was sufficient, including cereal, bagels and English muffins, and a waffle maker. While we weren't there long enough to check out the other amenities, it was good for a road trip stop."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Greeted by a receptionist with the demeanor of a prison guard, room had skimpy towels and no one picked up the phone at the front desk when we called (at 9 pm). clean but grim."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"The room was clean, bed was comfortable, breakfast very satisfactory. The fact that a good place to eat was across the parking lot helped greatly also."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Cleanliness is fair but toilet seat is too low and small.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Wrapping up my last day of a 5 day stay.Check in staff was polite and accommodating being I was traveling with a service dog.

After the from was cleaned on our 2nd day, we were not given any towels. I called the desk and was told I would have to come there. When I did, I was told they were all out of washcloths! they seemed understaffed and unable to handle the front lobby as well. The continental breakfast was fine, but for the price and overall experience, we won't stay there again ."

They helped with directions, refunded my money (no questions asked) when I lost money in the vending machine and gave me a bottle of water so I didn't have to try again with the machine.The bad... the rooms were super run down.  The hotel looked dirty and old.  I was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the outlets.  The breakfast food was not good.  The breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker.  No fruit, no yogurt... nothing healthy and awful coffee.

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,I was disappointed in the maintenance of the building.  It's age showed!!!  The staff seemed helpful.  The room was adequately clean though the age of the building  and lack of maintence was evident.  The availability for three consecutive nights was a positive for me as was the WIFI in the rooms.  Breakfast was adequate.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Fine for a overnight stay to rest. Just a little worn around the edges
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Not so great. My band mates and I drove 20 hours straight, walk into the hotel, and when I started the check in process he clerk said ""I don't want any problems"". He also mentioned not wanting to have to call the police and basically implied that he didn't want us there. We were polite, and respectful the whole time. When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the ""patio"" was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth $120 a night."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Clean, basic, wifi, a bit outdated. Good for the money."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Stayed for one night. Everything was very clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Good price. Nice sliding doors and balcony. Would definitely stay here again.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"altho a little dated the room was comfortable and clean and quiet. The price was very reasonable and the breakfast altho not fancy or opulent was good with the usual coffee, waffles, fruit, juice, bagels, English muffins and cereal."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Both microwave and frig were provided in room which is very convenient. However, the room cleanness is questionable. A few pieces of long human hairs were under the bed cover and a dead bug was inside the icebox. Also, the toilet flash system was broken down. The breakfast didn't have any protein provided, which is kind of surprise and disappointed, e.g., no egg, sausage, nor bacon."

Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Terrible breakfast. Bad coffee. Musty smelling room.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,We only stayed one night and the room was clean and comfortable. Howard Johnson is the only hotel chain (and we have stayed in many other hotels)that allows their guests to open the room window or patio doors.  I wish the sliding door of our room would have been in its frame and not hanging away from the frame so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room. It was a lovely night to have the door open.
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"It was ok, they definitely need new towels."
Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,"Seems like I have a hard time finding a proper hotel in this area. I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition. Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper. Then again, seems par for the course in that area."

Americas Best Value Inn,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
Americas Best Value Inn,The place is a dump dirty stains on everything even the towels were dirty! It is a cheap filthy place don't waste you money I was better off sleeping in the car We couldn't stay in the room the hotel manager wouldn't even give us our money back !! Gross I need to disinfect myself and clothes !!
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room was clean, clerk was nice, staff brought extra pillow and towels/wash clothes upon request. Exterior looked uninviting, room looked outdated. Would only recommend if it was the last available property. Rooms rather small for two couples staying in the same room."

Americas Best Value Inn,I recently stayed there. I thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk was creepy. No matter when I left out the room he was lurking.

Americas Best Value Inn,"Room itself was sort of as expected, OK. The place is in a bit of disrepair. The manager must be the only one who works there.

Americas Best Value Inn,"Just wrapping up a cross-country trip writing reviews. While passing through Lancaster, PA we stayed at the local ABVI, as we did at all motel stops on the 3-week trip. The Lancaster ABVI, like most across the country, is a family run business, a great value, clean, good WIFI, coffee/pastry in the AM and no surprises."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Americas Best Value Inn has poor service. They screwed me over twice with their Indian Manager. The first time they took my food and put me through a hard time getting it back. The manager Anil P. Motwani was hard to find, I didn't get in contact with him once.

Americas Best Value Inn,Just a stop while traveling to Florida. It was just a stop for sleep on the way. Hotel semmed like what you would expect fot the price. Many fights broke out during the night and again in the morning soo I will avoid in the future.
Americas Best Value Inn,I read the reviews for this hotel...but in all honesty people are complaining but are not mentioning they are only paying between 40 to 50 a night. I stayed because we need something for a week cheap during a family emergency and paid 38 a night! Yes one of my 3 rooms had a cigarette smell but that was easily... More
Americas Best Value Inn,"The furniture was old, that could be tolerated. The bed was okay.The tub was so bad that there was no way to take a shower. The towels 2 small towels 2 small wash cloths. They were thread worn. There was a small wobbly table but no chairs.Went to the desk to have at least a couple of chairs and was informed that we would get them the next day. A lady overhearing our conversation brought us a chair from the restaurant. We never got another chair."
Americas Best Value Inn,"we picked this out over the internet and some of the interest was the location and the other was price. We arrived after dark which was the first mistake and the second was choosing it to begin with. It was very dirty and worn looking, glad I was only spending the night and left before it was sun up so I could not see hoe bad it really was."
Americas Best Value Inn,I didn't have any issues with my stay. I had my dog with me and the pet fee was reasonably. I would stay here again.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel was only 43 a night and it was worth half that. Disgusting! It smelled, guest were noisey throughout the night, and dirty. I only chose it because the hotels.com rep said it was a great hotel. Will NEVER take their word again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Staff very friendly. The hotel is being updated and served our needs.
Americas Best Value Inn,The place wasn't bad for the price but the room stunk to high heaven. It smelled like the carpet had been wet and never cleaned. Beds were comfortable and there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. A huge spider was on the outside door molding which was pretty scary. Hotel staff were very nice abs helpful.
Americas Best Value Inn,Dirty rooms. Dated. Do not believe the pictures. Staff were very nice and attentive. If it were for more than one night I would have kept on going.
Americas Best Value Inn,It was ok for a weekend stay.
Americas Best Value Inn,Staff was very friendly and helpful and the price and location were perfect The hotel could use minor repairs but overall I would and will be a repeat quest
Americas Best Value Inn,"It was a horrible experience, we paid in advance and arrived at night, the police patrolled the area and the people we probably shelter there were out and it smelt terrible. My mother was not well and could not go any farther so i had to let her rest or else paid or not I would have kept on driving. On the keycard envelope it instructed you to put on your dead bolt once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone. The room smelt awful and I used towels to cover the unclean chairs. This was the first time i have ever chose this brand and it will be the last."
Americas Best Value Inn,Very clean and nice rooms. Rate is pretty reasonable.
Americas Best Value Inn,"stained carpets,hot water out of the cold facets,dirty and stained shower curtain,hot water in the toilet,and large black cockroaches running around outside."
Americas Best Value Inn,Reservation was never put in to there computer. It was a good thing I had a printed receipt from expedia or I fear I may have had some trouble checking in. Room was musty but not real bad. Old spider web in the corner by the door.
Americas Best Value Inn,The room has a bad smell which cause a lot of flies !

Americas Best Value Inn,"We book 3 rooms . We were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for six rooms Expedia took care of that but that was not necessary stress situation, one of the rooms was stinking so badly that we had to ask for different one. When we wanted to relate Our problems to the manager at the time of checkout turned out that he was not available until afternoon I repeat never again"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Just wanted an inexpensive stopover off I95 on the way to Florida. You get what you pay for, and sometimes you don't even get that. The room was filthy, the towels were stained, there was an attached bar/ night club which added to the late night noise levels. Many tractor trailer rigs were parked out back outside my room, and some idled their engines all night long. Thie room was way overpriced. The staff were very friendly though."
Americas Best Value Inn,"WAS TO LATE TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE.... WE ACTUALLY SLEPT IN OUR CLOTHES, BECAUSE SHEETS WERE DIRTY, SINK, BATHROOM FLOOR AND BOWL DIRTY!!!!! IT DID NOT DESERVE THE RATING IT GOT!!!!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"WAS TO LATE TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE.... WE ACTUALLY SLEPT IN OUR CLOTHES, BECAUSE SHEETS WERE DIRTY, SINK, BATHROOM FLOOR AND BOWL DIRTY!!!!! IT DID NOT DESERVE THE RATING IT GOT!!!!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Once we checked in the front desk told us our room was clean and ready we would just be waiting on towels once we got to the room the door was wide open so we just went and the cleaning lady opened the door and said can I clean this room or what Very rude and disrespectful, the room stunk and the location is kind of sketchy something that reminded me of a scary movie. Don't get me wrong it's cheap and you can't expect much but there was tons of shady people and we only left the room once to go get dinner. I would have much rather slept in my car"
Americas Best Value Inn,"First they couldn't find our hotels.com reservation, but eventually did.They assigned us a smoking room that had been truly smoked in, and it was very uncomfortable there all night. We think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there, and throughout the night they were in front of our room smoking and talking that prevented us from any restful sleep. I would NOT recommend this to anyone, and we are surprised that Hotels.com recommends it."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room smelled,the air didn't work and the front desk called our room late that night accusing us of being on the roof with another group of people that we didn't even know that we're staying in a totally different room. Wish I could get my money back. It was not worth the money."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel was good. Friendly service and the room wasn't bad, but had minimal flaws. Found a couple bugs in the room, nothing horrible. Had a faint smell to it, and a few of the outlets didnt work. Overall stay was good though. Hotel had a full bar, and a resteraunt. Only thing i didnt like, and i know all hotels are like this but this one seemed like it was worse, was that you can hear everything outside the room. People kept walking by the room threw the night talking and can hear everything they were talking about."
Americas Best Value Inn,"They were all kinds of sizes, it was unbearable. Dirty dirty dirty. One was already smashed against the wall before I got there, and nobody cared to actually clean it up. I don't understand how this can be legal and I thought Expedia had some kind of minimum standard on their places - apparently not. I arrived late and the receptionist insisted that I did not have a reservation. I pulled it up on my phone and was eventually assigned this disgusting room."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Grabbed this hotel as an escape from an ice storm further north. Registered via Internet so we were unable to check out conditions. Should have paid 20-30 more elsewhere and would have been happier. Hotel was old. Many of the AC/heating units were hanging loose on the outside sidewalks leading to rooms. Our room had a bad smell, dirty carpets and stained ceiling. Walls were thin and conversations/ TV from next room could be heard. Phone in room was filthy...and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk ended with front desk not being able to hear my end of conversation. Had to walk down to office to get wifi password as it was posted nowhere in the room. Bathroom was old and needed a complete remodel. Bed was clean...only redeeming quality of room. No breakfast offered, but would have never eaten any food prepared there."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was nice but the smell was horrible, it gave me a headache, it smelled like roach spray"
Americas Best Value Inn,"When we travel we almost always stay at a Marriot or a I prefer hotel. However when every thing is full this place is not bad, it was fully booked . THE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND HAD EVERY EXCEPT A HAIR DRYER AND COFFEE MAKER. Would I reserve a room and go with my wife NO. Strangely enough they... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,Good hotel. Good everything. It is clean. Cheap price.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Awoken by a 1 am phone call for someone Trouble going back to sleep. Nosiy people coming and going. I would not recommend this motel. However, The desk attendant was very pleasant and gave me a downstairs room with a well lighted parking space. She went out of her way to provide a nice accomodation."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Having stayed at other locations operated by this chain, I knew not to expect 4 or 5 star lodging, but I did expect more than what we experienced. The hotel ( more like a motor inn), for its part, seems to be trying to improve, but, it still needs a lot of work. The easiest way for me to do this is to list all of the issues we had, so, here goes: 1. Non-smoking room next to a smoking room a room that still reeks of stale cigarette smoke. 2. There was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door frame, thus allowing the cool air to escape and the heat and humidity in. 3. Climate control! The ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't override the temp to try to make the room more comfortable. 4. Loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot very late making tons of noise. 5. Being awakened at 5:30 am on a Saturday to the screams of a woman fighting with her boyfriend right outside our door! 6. After finally getting back to sleep after the incident mentioned in 5, being re-awakened at 9 am on the same Saturday by the sounds of the building being power washed. (refer to 2 and, yup, you guessed it, water coming in under the crack)"
Americas Best Value Inn,Room was nice as were hotel staff. However area seemed dangerous with shady residents who seemed to be arguing very often. One night there was a bar brawl below our room with broken glass and shouting. Overall an unpleasant stay because of the environment.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I had to book a room at the last minute, I use these websites, too! :) Went online, read the reviews, had a couple of concerns and called the hotel, directly. Listen. I've stayed in the best 5 Star Hotels all over the world. Would I give this hotel a TRULY 5 Star review, no. However, I will say this. NEVER, at any time did I see, drug dealings,hookers, loud noices, etc. I'm still trying to figure out the one about the Apartment ComplexPeople, it's clean, bed's are comfy, Front Desk, AWESOME.. A SPECIAL THANKS TO CHARLES. I, honestly don't know what I would have done without his help. :) Housekeeping, ur the best. Thank you, for all the clean towels .Would, I stay here again Absolutely My reasons for going were medical. At the Clinic, people were talking about places they were staying, I'm not here to trash Major Hotel Chains. They all had complaints, didn't have Microwave, Mini fridge, Flat Screen, etc. We, had all these :) Thank you all .V.Kearns Great Adventure Travel, Miami, Florida"
Americas Best Value Inn,As soon as we entered the office we should have turned around and left. The stench of cigarette smoke filled the air and there were cats laying on the floor. When we went in the room after a long trip the room smelled terrible and the non-smoking room had cigarette burns on the sink and dressers. The sink wouldn't drain... More
Americas Best Value Inn,"I was on the property for 10 minutes max. Exhausted after driving 10 hours, my son and I had made a reservation here. Failed to mention there was a bar attached to the hotel, in one of the sketchiest hidden places around. We opened the hotel door, my son screamed because he was scared and it smelled moldy, we left. Do not bring your kids/yourself here!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"The representative at Hotels.com said, This is a great hotel for the price. The hotel is old, smelly, falling apart, noisey, and just plain disgusting. What's worse, there were SEVERAL nicer, cleaner, and better hotels at the next exit off of the highway. Not only will I NEVER stay there again, but I WILL NOT take the advice of a hotels.com representative anymore."
Americas Best Value Inn,"ihad previously read reviews about the shady people that hang around this motel.i had also read about the putrid smell.all of this was exactly as warned.the smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage. aafter i thought about it i realized this must be what a methlab smells like it was so strong.we burned candles and went through a bottle of febreeze to kill the smell but it was baked in. at one in the morning there was so much yelling outside it woke me out of sleep and when i looked at the peephole i witnessed a fight.the guy even fell on my door as i was looking out of it. one of the first things i did when we went in the room was pick up the alarm clock,why dont know.but half a dozen roaches swarmed from under it.and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed. this place could make some people sick.and if that smell was the smell of a meth lab,then it is a huge public safety issue. however if you just want to buy dope and/or prostitutes, go here.seems like the mecca for such activities"
Americas Best Value Inn,"We arrived for our rooms that afternoon to a man in the lobby arguing with an attendant. They could not find our reservations that was made the night before for 2 nights. When they found them, the room was in the back and the very end and on the top. Went under balcony to go upstairs and there was people hanging around outside like they lived there. Going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it could have been blood and when we got in the room the water wouldn't work in the shower. The location is out in the middle of nowhere. I will NEVER stay here again. Needless to say I cancelled the second night and went to stay at the Suburban Extended Stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,Nice place to stay on a budget.
Americas Best Value Inn,Pictures speak for it all. Pic all over. Need to be shut down
Americas Best Value Inn,"I liked that the owner likes cats. They had 3 who meet you at the reservation desk. I saw a bar with pool tables. Small dining area with fast food ( music from the bar a little loud to sit with family ). They need to build on the menu. pool had some algae on the bottom ( safety locks for the pool area I liked )pool area needs tables chairs with umbrella:s.A playground for kids, had no swings. Across the street is a truck stop."
Americas Best Value Inn,I reserved the room through Expedia and found everything to be just like I was told it would be. I arrived and got checked into the room and found it to be a little warm. But aside from that I always sleep under a ceiling fan and a stationary oscillating fan. One of the guest went to the front counter and spoke to the clerk there and the clerk gave him a fan for me to use. It was only suppose to be for 1 night so the next morning we checked out and went to complete our business in Florence. We ended up not being able to conclude our business so we came back and got another room for that night and used the fan again. We also decided on the second night to pick up supper from the kitchen and eat in the room. We had the Hamburger Steak with Baked Potato and House Salad. It was absolutely delicious. Very Good Job!!!!
Americas Best Value Inn,"Finding the location at first was a little difficult because the website says its on a different road than it actually is. Once we found it, we were put in a really smelly room (smelled like mold, was actually bug spray...) The staff, however, was really understanding and literally walked me all over the hotel to find a room I was comfortable with. Apparently, they have just renovated and the bug spray smell is very strong in some rooms. We found a room that smelled fine and enjoyed our stay. So, beginning of trip was a little rocky but the staff made the stay much better. Not sure if they had a complimentary breakfast because we left so early. Overall, if you need a quick, one night stay, this place is just fine."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I appreciate that I was able to walk in without a reservation at the last minute and get a room but the towels were very thin and scratchy, the bed was lumpy and the linens were dirty and uncomfortable."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel is pet friendly but the rooms have a terrible ordor. Had to request a room change because the odor was so bad. My second room had no less than 20 flies in the window behind the drapes. They have a bar/grill on site... when I went to get a drink, another patron asked me did I fool around . I dont know if this is a pick-up spot or what."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The only plus was that it was right off the interstate if you're traveling through. The hotel itself was pretty bad. The room was dirty, the beds uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the room we could barely sleep. It was noisy too, and the bright lights from the parking lot lit up our room all night, even through the curtain. Pretty horrible place."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We never got to stay at the hotel cause they gave our rooms away and still charged my card without my consent and refused to give me a refund I had to go through my bank to be refunded.the hotel staff was very rude I wouldn't never recommend or stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a much better hotel.,."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The first thing I noticed when I stepped into the room was the very strong oder. When I left next morning, my cloth was soaked with the bad smell. The toilet seat was stickey. The towel was like sandpaper."
Americas Best Value Inn,The room had a bad odor and the blankets had holes
Americas Best Value Inn,it was so nice
Americas Best Value Inn,A nice clean hotel close to the highway. The place is well kept.

Americas Best Value Inn,"We stayed here for one evening on way to Florida. Room had a jacuzzi. Pet friendly. We were charged an additional 5.00 US for the dog. Not the greatest of locations, but right off exit on I-95. Free Wi-FI."
Americas Best Value Inn,"This was a terrible, awful hotel. The first room they put me in, the strike plate was missing on the door. The faucets were ancient, wrong for the sink, and they turned the wrong way. The spindle was missing on the toilet paper holder. Someone had left hairclips to hold the curtains together. And when I turned the sheets back, it was clear that they were not clean. I went back to the desk and found out that while I'd paid 50 for the room, it was a 30 room (this is a very cheap hotel). They put me in a 50 room, which was slightly better, but had a distinct, bad smell that stopped when I shut the A/C off. This is a terrible hotel. The only good thing about it is the two cats who live there."
Americas Best Value Inn,"First let me say that I am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means. I am not a clean freak by any definition. I often stay in 30 - 40/night places that leave plenty to be desired, and I've never once left a bad review or complained to the staff. I fully realize that you get what you pay for. However, this place is the worst I've ever stayed, bar none. The outside of the hotel was filthy. Feral cats and trash everywhere. The lobby was filthy. The room was filthy. Looking behind the bed for an outlet to plug my phone in, it was clear that no one had vacuumed under the bed in a very long time....it wasn't just dusty, it was gross. The carpet, bed skirt, and couch were all badly stained. The couch stunk like a combination of mold, cigarette smoke (even though this was a nonsmoking room), and sweat, making the whole room stink. The counter outside the bathroom was damaged. The bathtub had small hairs in it."
Americas Best Value Inn,"After a long day on the road, this place was a welcome find. Rooms were quiet and dark, with a nice night light for the bathroom.

When I finally got my food back they kept my chicken. The second time I got screwed over, I check into the hotel around 2 a.m. Saturday morning, the lady at the front desk was not there I had to stand there and wait by that time I got tired and went to see if she was in the bar (The Edge) and there she was. She checked me in and I ask her what time did I have to check out she said Sunday Morning at 11 a.m. so Saturday around 2 p.m. they came and told me I had to check out the room and the manager also stated then We never let people stay over 24 hours.

Americas Best Value Inn,"Had to switch rooms, front desk was very helpful. TV didn't work in second room. Maintenance person was not very cordial. Replaced TV when we went to dinner. No notification or indication they had replaced it. We have stayed in hotel before around 3 years ago. Has gone down and nothing has been upgraded. Last time."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel is basic, decent rooms, comfortable. HVAC a little noisy. Not much of a neighborhood, but at least a Denny's next door. Stayed on side away from interstate not sure how noisy that side would be. Friendly, helpful check-in lady. For 79 hard to beat the price."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I suppose this was not a bad hotel, but it wasn't the greatest. It was right off the highway and back behind a Denny's. There were suspicious people loitering outside the parking lot when we came into town and some strange guests hanging out in the lobby. This, of course, is not necessarily the hotel's fault, but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come. The check-in went smoothly, but the elevator ride to the 3rd floor for our room was another story - bumping and screeching the whole way up. Then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of musty smoke and a over-powering attempt of someone trying to cover up the stench with cleaning products. Thankfully our room did not absorb any of the smell from the hallway and by our check-out on the third day, the hallway had mostly cleared of smell...or maybe my nostrils were used to it Either way, if we had to stay longer than the weekend, I probably would have begged to check-out, which I rarely do. Consider staying somewhere else, especially if travelling alone."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was a little concerning that there were notes/instructions all over the hotel on the correct way to use the elevators and tv remotes. Our television didn't work in our room.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Very close to interstate and restaurants. Clean room, nice staff, and comfortable, clean room."
Americas Best Value Inn,Booked this stay at last minute while making a long trip so we were kind of skeptical about it at first. When we first arrived I was very pleased with how clean the entire hotel was and also smelled awesome lol. But anyways the bed and everything in the room was great.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The elevator still doesn't work and they have printed out pieces of paper everywhere saying things like: Press the elevator button just once, because it will get stuck and will stay on that floor. I think they could make better signs if that was really a problem. The room itself is ok. The sheets are very thin and you can see the mattress underneath. It was not very comfortable, but it wasn't horrible. It was clean and that was all I needed, but I wouldn't get it if I was staying in Spartanburg for more than a night. Breakfast is basic and simple, but it is free. I was surprised that when you walk in the doors are not automatic, you have to pull on the glass doors and try to hold it open while you pull your suitcase."
Americas Best Value Inn,The beds are like laying on plywood-the floor was actually softer than the bed. Couldn't sleep
Americas Best Value Inn,Stayed here on our way to visit family in Georgia and Florida. What a terrific deal. The room and hotel as a whole was clean with no strange smells. the staff at check in and check out were very friendly and gave us good advise as to where to eat. This is definitely a place I will stay at again next time I head south to see my family.
Americas Best Value Inn,"3.5 stars for this one. The staff were very friendly and kind. The room was a bit dirty, walls and doors needed a scrub. Internet while free was not very reliable and the tv/cable was outdated. Loved the fact that the entire hotel is nonsmoking but that just meant that all the smokers were gathered outside the front door, causing everyone to walk through the smoke to enter the hotel."
Americas Best Value Inn,Everything was fine. Staff very friendly room quiet. Only problem air conditioner was only too cold or completely off.

Americas Best Value Inn,"The name says it all - it's a great value! There's a few minor problems we noticed, but for the price and the service it got a 5 rating for me! The location is great and there's a great retro Denny's next door. We would recommend this hotel and would stay again!"
Americas Best Value Inn,Very shabby place. Needs through upgrade and cleaning. Nice nite front desk lady.
Americas Best Value Inn,First room checked into the room smelled of dog and urine so bad that my throat stared to close off and I couldn't breath. I went down to the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because I made the reservation on. We hen I told them I had allergies and can't stay in that room is when they gave me another room. That rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them so you can see the matteress. The towels have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper. I booked this hotel because I had a pool and said limited pets. Well the pool is broken too. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm here because a family had an accident and is in the hospital I would not stay here. Since it's also a holiday weekend rooms are limited. I can say NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE!
Americas Best Value Inn,"Within 10 minutes of everything you need shopping, dinning, entertainment even a beautiful lake."
Americas Best Value Inn,We plan on staying there every time we visit that area.....and the WiFi was OUTSTANDING !
Americas Best Value Inn,The front desk guy was very nice and polite he had great customer service skills and was very welcoming to me
Americas Best Value Inn,"Good place, but showing a bit of age. The beds were very comfortable."
Americas Best Value Inn,Front desk was very friendly. Our room was clean and everything was nice. No complaints. I would stay here again if I come back to the area.
Americas Best Value Inn,"There were holes in the walls and dirt around the edges of the bathroom. I rented based on the cheap price and only stayed from 11pm to 9am the next morning. The beds were not comfortable, and the bedspreads were obviously old and cheap."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We needed a place to wait 3 weeks until the close of our house. This was the perfect affordable home away from home. Staff friendly (especially the young man who checked us in). It was clean, quiet, safe and provided a great base location to visit Spartanburg, Greenville, and the Gaffney outlet mall. I don't understand the other reviews about unfriendly people, as all were nice. Maids were great at keeping our room clean. Breakfast typical continental but well stocked. Obviously not the Hilton, but if you need a safe, quiet, clean place don't count this out."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Checked in on Thursday and had reserved a room with a tub, once I got to my room I found there was no tub so I went back to desk and they fixed the error ASAP I was very pleased. The room was very clean, hotel was very clean, staff was friendly. Breakfast was basic, and was lacking in fruit but was sufficient. King bed was by comfortable and I was very pleased, pillows were also great!!"
Americas Best Value Inn,There was a horrible smell inside the room the worst experience ever
Americas Best Value Inn,The staff was courteous. The breakfast is barely worth going downstairs for.
Americas Best Value Inn,Old hotel. Worst free breakfast I've ever had at a hotel.
Americas Best Value Inn,"This was the third or fourth time over the past eight years we have stayed at this hotel. We have stayed here simply due to convenience of location to my father's home. Otherwise, we would not stay here. It is clean and generally comfortable, but it is getting rundown, and the amenities are minimal. However, it is comparatively inexpensive to other newer hotels in the area. When we travel to this are again, we probably will stay somewhere else, as there are now 2-3 other options."
Americas Best Value Inn,The breakfast was a joke. Maybe consider having some fresh items like fruit.
Americas Best Value Inn,Customer service was great. Very attentive. No pool and the smoke pit location was at the entrance giving the hotel an awful smell. Continental breakfast fills every need. Location of the hotel is convenient.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We were in town for a volleyball tournament, and I chose to stay here for the second time. The room was nice, and clean, but small. The room still fit our needs, and I was satisfied."
Americas Best Value Inn,Waste of my time and money
Americas Best Value Inn,"Clean, helpful staff, noisy A/C, OK for money, try for room away from I-85"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Elevators were gross. They looked like they had been vomited in several times over the years, and never cleaned. Hallway carpet had huge stains in many places. The air conditioners/heaters in the nearby rooms were so loud, that their cycling on an off through the night made it almost impossible to get a good night's sleep. The continental breakfast was not good. There was no butter or margarine for the toast. Coffee was weak and only one type of artificial sweetener."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The accommodations and amenities were not what we were used to as we had to make reservations last minute due to death in the family. Thought that the hot/cold breakfast buffet would have included more of a variety but the stay was exceptional because of the way that the staff responded to our arrival, needs and departure. We did not run into one problem that could not be addressed with pleasantness! No matter the request, it was meet by willingness and genuine concern for our needs. I had never heard of this hotel before this stay but because of the staff I have already recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends. Thanks for a pleasant stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,Many of the light fixtures in the room didn't work. Air conditioner rattled excessively. A lot of noise from the highway all night long.
Americas Best Value Inn,Staff were very helpful always friendly we enjoyed our stay.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We had a nice stay, staff was pleasant and helpful as always. We always enjoy our stay when we go to Spartanburg SC."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We had to stop for the night just long enough to sleep and grab a shower, so we didn't want to spend a lot for a room. At first the front desk clerk was a bit rude, like we were making her work. Then when we checked-in, she was really nice. Our room was nothing special at all, but it... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,Very quiet evening spent in this hotel. Everything was good.
Americas Best Value Inn,One totally inoperative elevator and a second elevator that seemed barely functional plus slow. Elevator was quite dirty and blocked by cleaning crew cart. No operative ice machines. No ability to look out windows as they totally blocked by filth....like being in a submarine. Antique TV set with faulty remote control. My opinion is that management needs serious training and the board of directors should be remanded to the room assigned to me.....the disgusting windows make the room claustrophobic. The only normalcy was a competent pleasant attendant.
Americas Best Value Inn,comfortable bed and a nice hot shower. Price was very reasonable.
Americas Best Value Inn,Room very nice! But ice machine broke on the floor and no refrigerator in room!
Americas Best Value Inn,I was lost and very tired. The hotel staff stayed on the phone and helped me find there facility. I was so grateful to just hear a friendly voice. The service was excellent and every thing worked. I sleep great. I have met rude staff before and the staff person was just awesome I truly hope she gets the credit she deserves. I just wish I could publish her name however I was so tired I did not write it down. Thanks again so much
Americas Best Value Inn,Stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to Interstate 85 and the ease of getting around. I was attending my grand-daughters's wedding in Campobello. The hotel was clean and quiet.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Never in my life have I encountered such a rude staff member at a front desk. What makes matters worse is she told me she is the manager! Do NOT give this woman your business. Let me tell ya, Donald Trump would have a field day with this woman. The visit was for one night and seemed ok until I... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Rm stuffy, felt closed in. Not bright airy. Just wasn't what I needed or expected."
Americas Best Value Inn,No words
Americas Best Value Inn,Room and bathroom very small. Furniture old and falling apart. Staff unprofessional. Big spider in bathroom. . . no microwave in room
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was fine, but the breakfast was awful."
Americas Best Value Inn,I had a positive experience with this hotel. The price was good and the product was good.
Americas Best Value Inn,I was giving my girlfriend a nice get away for her birthday and we had a great time. Will use this hotel again.
Americas Best Value Inn,Enjoyed our stay Staff was very professional
Americas Best Value Inn,Terrible hotel. The beds were super hard. No refrigerators. People hanging outside
Americas Best Value Inn,"This is an economy motel in today's market. It's reasonably convenient to I-26 and right off of I-85. The room and common areas were clean. There are few food choices in the immediate vicinity, but we ordered pizza and the delivery was prompt. Breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any fruit. I need a handicap accessible... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"breakfirst is very soso, and rooms have not refrig, and one of the two elevators is out of work, but the location is good and staff is nice...."
Americas Best Value Inn,The hotel floor we were staying smelled like fish. No fridge or microwave. We had to jump through hoops to get cable on.
Americas Best Value Inn,"It was so bad we cancelled our stay of 3 nights to just one. We would have cancelled that night but it was too late as we arrived around 10pm. The room was small, the bed was hard as a rock, there was one sheet on the bed and no pad underneath, the pillows were half the size of normal pillows, the tv was from 1990, the carpet had stains (some that were still wet) and last but not least the roaches ruled the night!! So don't turn off the lights! The next morning we noticed That they even had a can of roach spray right on the main counter. The breakfast was garbage. The coffee brewing pot was left wide open without a cover and the women at the front counter was just finishing up killing a few roaches with the spray!! I would suggest that unless your life depended on it don't stay here! (Maybe not even then!)"
Americas Best Value Inn,My family and I have stayed at this hotel several times for softball tournaments. Each time it seems to be worse then the last. This is the last time we will be staying. Front desk is rude. Rooms have odd oder to them. Hotel has 2 elevators at this visit the 2nd one is operating it was stuck on 4th... More
Americas Best Value Inn,"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 10 years primarily because of its location convenient to my father's home. This time we noticed that it has become rundown quite a bit. There were torn curtains, stained (but clean) sheets, and the room overall looked worn. We found the first room assigned to us to be occupied when we opened the door, which we fortunately realized immediately. We were assigned a nearby room, but our keys suddenly stopped working after 2 days. We will not stay here again, even though it seems to be the cheapest option in the area. I classify this as you get what you pay for."
Americas Best Value Inn,"It was a wonderful stay. It was a little difficult to find according to the location address I was given when looking for a hotel to stay in, other than that everything was perfect. Thank you."
Americas Best Value Inn,This was a perfect hotel to stop off at on our way to the beach for spring break! They're right off the interstate so it was an easy on and easy off. The staff was very pleasant and nice to work with. The room had everything we needed and they had a light breakfast.
Americas Best Value Inn,"IF I had paid 107 for this room, I would have complained about a missing light bulb, a non-working alarm clock and a meager breakfast. BUT for 57 I was very pleased with the accommodations. It is clean and comfortable. My wife and I walked next door to Denny's for breakfast (and still had half of our 50 savings left... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I stayed three nights, and housekeeping did not service my room, even though I put out the notice on the door. After the second night, I told the staff member who was at the front desk in the morning that my room had not been serviced, and asked that the housekeeping staff please at least take out the trash from my previous night's dinner. When I returned at the end of the day, that had not been done. I told the staff member on night duty, and after 20 minutes she called had obtained a credit for me from the manager. She also offered to come up and collect the trash herself. I appreciate her efforts, and the manager's responsiveness, but the rest of the staff don't seem to really care too much."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Not so good. Let's see, the exterior was trashy, literally trash, cigarette butts, bags of trash, in the parking lot. Our room was situated right next to the elevator. The walls/door was paper thin and the bed was up against the wall so we heard everyone and everything as they were getting on and off the elevator. The AC/Heater was so loud when running it was difficult to hear the old fashioned tv. No mini fridge, microwave or coffee maker. Cheap toiletries, we got two shampoos instead of a shampoo and conditioner. The towels were small and rough, some had stains on them. Breakfast was cheap, no fruit or yogurt. I have celiac disease and there was absolutely nothing I could eat. Juice was containers in a small fridge you had to pour yourself. The sound system playing throughout the hotel was playing hip hop music. The young man at the front desk had a hoodie on and kept his hood up while he talked on the phone the whole time. The only good thing about this hotel is it only charged 10.00 per night for my dog to stay with us and there was a Denny's within walking distance"
Americas Best Value Inn,We stayed here a week while visiting family. Cons: No coffee in our room Mixed : Breakfast was good but a bit sparse however there is a Denny's next door. The exercise room had nice equipment but the air conditioner was broken. On our second day there they brought in a fan. Pros:The staff was great. Housekeeping was great. The... More
Americas Best Value Inn,Overall the motel was nice the only thing that we didn't like was no microwave and no frigerator and none of the rooms and the smell what perfume when you walk into the lobby was overpowering besides that it was great
Americas Best Value Inn,"Very basic and in need of renovation, but price was low so it was appropriately priced for what one gets."
Americas Best Value Inn,Was OK for the price.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I didn't like this hotel. I stayed here for a speaking engagement at a local college the next day. But they never put my reservation into the system and the man at the front desk - who wore a hoodie - had to look through their emails to find it. I use a wheelchair and there was no button at the front door. When I got to my room, I had to keep the old-fashioned AC on fan because it was noisy otherwise. The TV was at least 20 years old. I couldn't close the fridge all the way, and I couldn't close the bathroom door while my chair was in it. Needless to say, I'll find another hotel next time."
Americas Best Value Inn,We check in and desk clerk give us room.... when we open the room .... and room was not ready .... then they give us 2nd room and also was not ready and we complaint to the desk clerk he told us that he will check room his self 1st that make sure room is ready 3rd room was given and it was look like some body have just made that bed and forget to remove trash from the trash bin....... we just left the hotel ......... ask desk clerk his name so we can complainant about him and he told us I will not give you your money back ..... you can complainant to any Patel or Desai This was not a good hospitality and rude staff ............ will never no there again
Americas Best Value Inn,We stayed here on a college visit. Katrina at the desk provided exceptional customer service. Room was very clean- quick check in- decent continental breakfast. I was nervous because of a couple bad reviews but don't be swayed- a great value and bedbug free- I checked because I am in a hospitality profession and have that knowledge. Katrina even offered... More
Americas Best Value Inn,Traveled through michigan for honeymoon. Stayed here for 2 nights. We got the hot tub room. Very out dated. Had a blurry tube tv. Old hot tub. Breakfast was supposed to get over at ten. At 915 we went down and he was cleaning up said we can have coffee and thats it. Save yourself time and dont stay here
Americas Best Value Inn,"Air conditioner didn't work til I played with the buttons for 10 min, toilet had remnants in it from previous guest, bed spread and sheets had stains on them, rates had been jacked-up to triple what a motel of this poor condition should cost because there was events in the area that gave people no choice. (This is where the term highway robbery comes from) Motels like this should not be allowed to charge 170 for a room under any circumstances, we checked out when we found out they wanted that much for a second night."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Old, smelled bad and expensive. We will not stay there again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Need to start at front door and work your way thru fixing up the place.
Americas Best Value Inn,"It was excruciatingly horrible and a waste of money! I would of rathered slept in my van and left the money I paid to the homeless! The manager was SO RUDE. and when I mentioned how he was rude to one of his customers his reply was I can speak to my customers however I want, if you don't like it leave and then proceeded to mention how I will not get a refund because it's a third party billing and I'm not worth his business. Why did this start! Because I asked for extra towels!(for which I was told no, I should of done that when I booked the room, and what manager doesn't have a key to his own laundry room) Come to find out DO NOT use their towels. they are unaccunacceptable for any hotel! I wouldn't use them on my dog. They literally are falling apart and disgusting. They feel like their dirty cleaning towels. the hotel was dirty, I am not sure they know what a vacuum is. The room is even worse, filthy tub, mold faucet, carpets and fixtures filled with dust. Yet this is a vacation spot... Those wanting to spend a great time in Whitehall, do NOT visit here or your vacation will go down hill the minute you walk in the door."
Americas Best Value Inn,Basic hotel with great location - minutes from Michigan's Adventure which was our main reason
Americas Best Value Inn,"Our room was below ground level. It was so damp that even the linens felt wet. The carpet was wet and the room smelled musky like mold, mildew, and cigarettes. We both woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly. The shower faucet was broken. It was a mixing type faucet that would only allow flow at the hot or cold end. It would turn the water off in the middle (warm) area so I had to choose between a hot or cold shower. Not a great way to start the day after spending a night in a cold, damp room. To top all this off. The front desk is vacant most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent. There were also drug heads running around in the parking lot all night. We arrived after midnight and there were multiple guests sitting in their cars and hanging out in the lot. When we left in the morning many of them were still hanging out in the parking lot and obviously strung out. If you are bringing a rig up to drive on the dunes I would not recommend parking it in the hotel lot. There are many other properties in the area that are a better choice and most of them are cheaper. There are 2 hotels right across the street from one another at this exit. If you are deciding between the 2 of them, do not make my mistake."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Very confusing to find. Operating as America's Best Value, but sign says Econolodge. No mention of this in the reservation/confirmation. I spent an extra 30 minutes searching for the address in a strange place in the dark, finally called the hotel phone. Also, sign in room said continental breakfast, but there was only coffee. The room seemed clean. The TV remote had no batteries. The young lady at the desk was very nice and brought batteries on request."
Americas Best Value Inn,Rooms are to much for the price....I could get a better room for 39.99.... Not 100+ dollars.
Americas Best Value Inn,Front desk girl is very nice. No ice machine. No fridges or microwaves available. Room was clean but had quite a funky smell.
Americas Best Value Inn,"This is probably the filthiest hotel I have ever seen. Old, tired and in need of drastic upgrading. A blowtorch would be a good start. The front desk person, although nice and cordial, had a very poor command of the English language. I could barely understand anything he said. We ended up leaving and cancelling our reservation, and drove another 30 miles north to find a room."
Americas Best Value Inn,"There was no breakfast (although it said they would provide), no ICE machine and no elevators. Room was clean but there is a door between 2 rooms, and you can hear EVERYTHING on the other room. There were 6 guys chatting all night and my family could not sleep. Had to complain twice."
Americas Best Value Inn,Place was really run down. The towels had grease stains on them and when we asked for more they said they didn't have any. Had a problem communicating with staff due to a language barrier. Not a pleasant experience.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Filthy Spiders webs everywhere Scum in tub, hot tub and sink Mold in toilet"
Americas Best Value Inn,"This hotel was dirty, unkept and did not have any amenities as promised. We even had to go buy our own ice. Spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay."
Americas Best Value Inn,Nice place. Convenient location. Safe area. Continental breakfast OK. I would stay there again.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was very stained. The bathtub was also stained and it all just felt very dirty. The man at the front desk was rude when he checked us in, it was as if we were an inconvenience, not painv customers."

Americas Best Value Inn,"My husband and i had the King bed room with hot tub. Hot tub was spacious, in the room to watch tv. Room was pleasant, with plenty of room, but had a little odor like it dose not get aired out well. It was a nice night for just the two of us. Could easily fit a small family in there, there was a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed. Not a 5 star hotel, but i would return."
Americas Best Value Inn,did not like the atmoshere. Very dull place to be.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We just needed a place to crash for the night we were attending an event in the area that started early in the morning. The hotel was adequate for that, but the overall condition and cleanness were just passable ant other than Wifi there were no amenities at all"
Americas Best Value Inn,The room and staff were ok. No kleenex no glasses or cups. Couch/hideabed were worn out. As you sat it just keep sinking. Too high price for conditions.
Americas Best Value Inn,This is the worst hotel that I have EVER stayed in! There were no towels and when. Went down to the lobby to get some they gave me two hand towels and apologized. The lady said they had been asking the owners for a couple of months for more towels and that they just ignore their requests. Hotel was filthy dirty! I slept in my socks for fear of stepping on something crawling. There was no internet as advertised either! The air did not work so I was hot all night and miserable! This hotel should be taken off the list. I should get a refund it was so bad!
Americas Best Value Inn,Hotel was gross and management didnt speak English so bad service no ice machine or fridges or microwaves carpet was disgusting beds look like they could of had bed bugs. Very upset that Hotel .com would promote them you should have this place checked out not up to standards.

Americas Best Value Inn,"The absolute worst motel I've encountered. We asked to cancel upon arriving and were still charged the full amount, even though we cancelled and did not stay there. Very rude service, bad odor, disgustingly dirty carpets. Do your self a favor and avoid this place at all costs. My family chose the risk of not finding another place and possibly sleeping in the car and being charged than staying in this filthy dump!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Disappointing stay, especially considering the cost. First they had trouble finding my reservation in the system, and complained that reservations through sites like Hotels.com had not been loading into their system properly lately. Thankfully that was resolved after it was found to be a misunderstanding between my full name and my shortened, casual name. Second, when requesting a wake up call for the next morning, one never came. Thankfully the alarm on my phone was enough. Glad I only had to stay one night. I wouldn't stay there again."

Americas Best Value Inn,Was what you would expect for price. Requested refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the day before but there was none in the room. Hotel is directly behind gas station and my view from room was the gas stations pumps. Black out curtains ineffective as light from the gas station poured into the room all night.also room was listed as smoking and when I checked in manager informed me all the rooms were non smoking
Americas Best Value Inn,The service was terrible the hotel staff was very rude and their towels were like sand paper I would not recommend this hotel to anyone plus on line we reserved for Americas best value inn and we got their it was econolodge it was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't have it worst hotel I've ever been to
Americas Best Value Inn,"I am offended and disgusted that I paid to sleep in this dump. It was a busy holiday weekend where rooms at any hotel were few and far between and prices were way inflated. Hence the emergency landing here.. I would choose to sleep in my car next time before booking this dump. But as I booked end prepaid through hotels dot com app, I had no way out other than to forfeit my money.. so we stayed on the springy cheap mattress in the dirty room with mold in the bathroom and God the list could go on.. this place isn't worth 29 a night let alone the hundred twenty nine we got robbed for. I've stayed in better in third world countries.. seriously.."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Awful condition! Old decor with stained walls. Tub was stained with rust. Breakfast was cereal or you could use their waffle maker. Had to pay 188 for the night because everywhere else in town was sold out. When we pulled in to the parking lot, we saw two men sitting behind the building smoking. One had a house arrest ankle tether! Building obviously used to allow smoking. To its credit, at least the lobby and hallways had a strong odor of cleaning supplies."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was under reno and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance. Our friends had a room that smelled terrible and had to move. Our room was renovated and nice but had not been well cleaned .
Americas Best Value Inn,"Expedia... You are much better then to have this place listed. We stayed from the 11th up until today (18th).... He was very rude. Only had housekeeping 1 day that was only because I requested it. He offered me a small broom and broken dustpan to clean my own room up. Then after checkout took off 55 off of my card. (Tried to take 250)... After not listening to me to explain myself he started cussing and spewing profanities. He said the room had damage. Which was some chocolate from my daughter. And some vacuum wouldn't handle. Well Housekeepers... I had the police involved, he agreed with me on all. He couldn't return my money but gave me a lesson....lol. that's to NEVER give them my business and hope I can prevent somebody else from loosing some money. Another couple had paid a week up front but had to leave 3 days earlier. Not very friendly as its only him and 1 housekeeper."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Do not take the last available room, the staff probably did what they could with what they had. The entire place should be taken down and start over. Location is really great. There are few motels in Whitehall for Summer time, probably plenty for the winter. A hotel with a moderate priced restaurant attached, would be great however, this place should be removed. It reflects Whitehall in a very negative way!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Found someone's dirty Kleenex and crumbs in our made bed. Told front desk and they put us in a new room. Hotel is in major need of updating and lacks some basic hotel amenities like clocks in the rooms, an ice machine, and low on towels. Continental breakfast was good. Hotel is in good location to nearby attractions."
Americas Best Value Inn,Needs updating. Everything is worn
Americas Best Value Inn,"The people at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful. We even got to check in early. The outside of the hotel seemed to be just updated and it looked fantastic, but inside the rooms were terrible. They asked us not to smoke in the rooms (not that we would) but the rooms already smelled so terrible of smoke, it seemed a little backwards. We didn't dare take showers. The carpets were filthy... hopefully a remodel of the rooms themselves are in the works. Heavily overpriced due to a local festival."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We arrived late and were tired. When the door to the non-smoking room was opened the cigarette smoke smell hit us like the smell of cat pee! The frig was hard to open and not turned on, the phone by the bed was plugged in but NOT WORKING. The bed was sloppily made. The only thing that saved that room was the large two-person tub with jets - it was clean and there was plenty of hot water! The bed was a comfortable bed, but all the linens and towels smelled of smoke as well. This is one of those hotels that is decades old, is going through low budget renovation, and is in the middle (I think) of the process so it looked unpleasantly incomplete - especially for the price paid!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"This hotel is one that allows pets. We were not sure what we would find when we checked in. When you are traveling on a budget with a pet sometimes the accommodations can be way overpriced and very disappointing. Some places charge a ridiculous rate for pets and are not really that pet friendly. The pet fee at this hotel was only 25. Though the hotel was older (and a bit worn) it was clean and the staff extremely friendly and kind to our little Bella. She had a fine time going out for her walks, the area was safe to walk her (even at night) and away from traffic and she was always greeted with a Hello Bella from the staff when she returned. It was disappointing that the new ice maker had not yet been delivered (installation was over due - not the hotels fault certainly) and the staff apologized for the lack of an ice maker. Luckily the weather was not extremely hot. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice. Belgin waffle at breakfast was quite good, much better than expected for a do-it-yourself waffle. This place was convenient to highway exit, gas stations, restaurants and stores nearby, least expensive price in the area after summer season rates started. It was clean, very safe, very quiet and we felt welcome. We would stay here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Air conditioner had 1 setting (cold) and the heater would not even start. Interupted several times during the night loud talking, slamming doors"
Americas Best Value Inn,"This place was terrible from start to finish. It started with the clerk charging 25 more for the first night than the online booking price because I wouldn't pay cash. The hotel is filthy. From the lobby to the hallways to the room itself, it was the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in. The towels were a brownish gray. There was mold in the bathtub. There were stains on the sheets. I had to sleep in my sleeping bag. I could go on for a while, but hopefully you get the point. There are plenty of hotels in this area to pick from. Avoid this one."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The breakfast was disgusting. Before I ate, I cleaned up for 10 minutes. The 1 trash can was overflowing, nobody had stocked in quite awhile, we ate cereal with forks (there were no spoons). It was creepy to use a community milk and cream cheese instead of the normal small hotel containers we're used to. The front desk attendant acted like a zombie (no emotion, not friendly or rude). I called a couple of days later to ask if they found a cell phone in the room. I was finally a little impressed that they said they'd call back very soon. Guess what They didn't call back!! To end on a positive note, the room was comfortable and the location of the hotel was in a cute town and super close to Michigan's Adventure."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel is a bit dated and could use some updating of carpet in hallways, but was pleased that room was clean and well prepared for our stay. Check in was easy and employee was very pleasant. Handicap accessible lobby and room which was important to us."
Americas Best Value Inn,Great hotel close to the stores and the beach mile from the bridge. I can't believe that I have to write all this just to rate this hotel. What a pain in the butt. Just another 100 words about my one night stay.
Americas Best Value Inn,Front staff was very nice. Hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad! The girl at the front desk was nice enough to give us a different room. That room was not much better but did not smell. Spend the extra money!!
Americas Best Value Inn,"Needs a few updates to the decor, but was clean. The staff went beyond to make sure we got everything we needed"
Americas Best Value Inn,Our room had a very musty smell because it was partly below the ground. The drapes were only partly attached to the rods. The carpets were very dirty. We thought that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates. The person at the desk was not very friendly.
Americas Best Value Inn,There was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premises. There was no iron and no pad or cover on the ironing board. Also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt. No Kleenex and only hand towels not even bath size towels! This hotel is very worn out and overpriced for economy price lodging.
Americas Best Value Inn,Old decor and musty. Rust stains in the tub. Only given one bath towel and was told no more were available so my husband had to dry off with washcloths. Saturday night stay found hotel very noisy with drunks in the hall and traffic noise. Room air conditioner also very noisy. All in all a disappointing stay for a relative's wedding with a night of no sleep.

Americas Best Value Inn,"cheapest in the area if you just want to sleep its ok, lots of dirt and left overs in the room,"
Americas Best Value Inn,was good hotel to stay at
Americas Best Value Inn,Mold on the exterior. Mold on the shower curtain. Looked abandoned and should have been. Not vacuumed. Cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room. Need I say more!
Americas Best Value Inn,"The motel is close to the highway. The staff were friendly but the front desk was usually unmanned. The staff were outside visiting with others. The bedspread had an obvious stain on it but the bed was comfortable. The A/C worked nicely. The TV remote worked intermittently. Overall, the cleanliness was acceptable but the flooring in the bathroom was curling along the front of the tub. With a little more effort it could be a decent alternative to the higher priced alternatives."
Americas Best Value Inn,We did not stay. It was absolutely disgusting. The bathroom was the worst. I will be calling hotel.coms customer service tomorrow morning since I just got back from my vacation today. The guy at the desk said he had to take my number for the manager to call me. If this place had a manager it wouldn't look like this. And of course no phone call.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Not bad for being so cheap! The interior is definitely outdated compared to the exterior. I picked a room with a hot tub in it. It was clean, and so was the room and bedding. The bathroom had some leak stains on the wall near the tub, but the bathroom was clean. Hotel service was great! And the location is great, too. Lots of places to pick from for dining. Just 20 minutes from Michigan's Adventure, and also just down the road from the shore of Lake Michigan! I'd stay here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,The room was clean and the staff was friendly.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was in okay shape. Bath room could use some work, seemed clean but there were a lot of finish issues."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The clerk was so rude and he knew only a few words of english. Several of the hotel guests were so frustrated like us. No ice machine, soda machine was broken. The breakfast room was so gross and dirty. Just a frustrating stay. 1st bad review I have written after 6 weeks on the road."

Americas Best Value Inn,"Front Desk was rude. Felt like we were bothering them. After getting in the room, I went to wash my hands and there was mouse dropping on the bathroom sink. The room had a foul odor. Headboards were different sizes. The tub was stained so bad I didn't want to take a shower. Towels had an odor to them. Wash my hands and used my shirt to dry off. Will never go back. We booked late. Will not do that again."
Americas Best Value Inn,I wish I had read the reviews before I made my reservation! It truly was only out of necessity (and not wanting to lose 152) that we stayed. Motel overall was rundown. Our room was musty. There was a white papery glob stuck to the back of the bathroom door. I paid way too much for a bad experience.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Our room was below ground level. It was so damp that even the linens felt wet. The carpet was wet and the room smelled musky like mold, mildew, and cigarettes. We both woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly. The shower faucet was broken. It was a mixing type faucet that would only allow flow at the hot or cold end. It would turn the water off in the middle (warm) area so I had to choose between a hot or cold shower. Not a great way to start the day after spending a night in a cold, damp room. To top all this off. The front desk is vacant most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent. There were also drug heads running around in the parking lot all night. We arrived after midnight and there were multiple guests sitting in their cars and hanging out in the lot. When we left in the morning many of them were still hanging out in the parking lot and obviously strung out. If you are bringing a rig up to drive on the dunes I would not recommend parking it in the hotel lot. There are many other properties in the area that are a better choice and most of them are cheaper. There are 2 hotels right across the street from one another at this exit. If you are deciding between the 2 of them, do not make my mistake."

Americas Best Value Inn,1. I wasn't given a non smoking room and I was told it was non smoking- I couldn't get rid of the smell out of the room2. Internet confusing to hook up to3. Room was not vacuumed curtain hanging down the bathroom was not clean hair in the shower from previous person that stayed there washcloth over showerhead and mold beside the toilet 4. But super close to Michigan adventures
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel older and run down. It smells, is musky and grungy. The staff smelled of cigerette smoke. They didn't even have an ice machine."
Americas Best Value Inn,The bathroom tub constantly leaked water. We called to desk service for extra pillows and at two separate times after ten pm. We got knocks at our door for extra towels. One set of towels given to us had a pile of dirt on it. We also noticed that our facilitator never worked at all.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Do not take the last available room, the staff probably did what they could with what they had. The entire place should be taken down and start over. Location is really great. There are few motels in Whitehall for Summer time, probably plenty for the winter. A hotel with a moderate priced restaurant attached, would be great however, this place should be removed. It reflects Whitehall in a very negative way!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"First off, nobody Mans the front desk. You have to call on the phone ant let them know you need help at the front desk. The language barrier makes it very hard to communicate and the strong silence is uncomfortable. There was people that had a electric heater set up on the hidden side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying. The drunks that occupied the area seemed friendly but wanted to know slot of personal information. They block the door open and are loud the entire night. No screens in any of the windows, so don't open them if you want the flies to stay out. The only reason I didn't walk out is because I kept my side arm on me at all times."
Americas Best Value Inn,"For the price, which admittedly is in a resort-like area, I expect more. Many small items in our room were broken (hooks, window treatment, etc.). The desk clerk was very nice. The breakfast was so-so. Basically the place needs some TLC."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Great staff of one, from what I could tell. He checked you in, checked you out, staffed the Continental Breakfast, answered any questions. Was very friendly, helpful, cheerful, represented the hotel very well. The room were clean and breakfast was okay. The location was convenient . For the price compared to other surrounding hotels, well worth it."

The front desk man was very friendly, the room was impeccable and the environment was quiet. It serves it's purposes well during my short stay in the area."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We stayed here for several nights while we attended a family event. This is a very basic hotel so you won't find any frills. What you will find is a good bed, clean room, and restful sleep. The breakfast was also very basic, with cold cereal and milk being the only options. Coffee was good. We would stay here again."

Americas Best Value Inn,"Have stayed here in the past and our experience has always been superb.

Americas Best Value Inn,"We were road-tripping across the country for a move from Chicago to LA when our alternator blew. After being towed into town, our tow truck driver brought us to Traveler's Inn on 4th Street. Because we were moving, we had our dog and cat in tow, so we needed a pet friendly option, and this modest motel filled the bill. The room was pretty basic, but it was clean, and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine. The TV had cable including HBO. There also is a pool out front, but it was closed as it was still early in the spring. The motel also is AAA approved, so if you have a card, you get a discount. There are a few nearby dining options, too, including a Taco John's and a old-time diner. Convenience stores also dot 4th street. Overall, it was very comfortable, pet friendly and cheap. Just what we needed for our short stay in North Platte."
Americas Best Value Inn,"My husband and I have stayed here many times! The owners are always so friendly when we go check in. Our room is always nice clean.

Americas Best Value Inn,Nice people and nice rooms at a reasonable rate. Pet friendly too!! My room was very clean and the micro/fridge was new and spotless. Was really surprised by the double sheeting on the bed which I only expect from pretty expensive motels. Overall it was a very nice stay.

Americas Best Value Inn,"I checked in about 6pm. Parked my truck and trailer in the parking lot in full view of the office. Was fast asleep at quarter till eleven when I received a phone call from the front desk telling me I had to move my truck. Went to talk to the front desk and they were insistant that I move my vehicle to a parking lot of a business across the street. I told them I didn't feel that would be very secure as I had bicycles and a motorcycle in the bed of my truck. They said that was the only alternative unless I wanted to park in the street - across from the hotel - NOT on the same side of the street where they would have been able to keep an eye on my equipment. When I said that would not be acceptable, the manager said he was refunding my money and I should go find another place to stay AT 11:00 AT NIGHT!!! Needless to say I was stunned and I left. I have never approached this type of insensitivy and poor customer service in my entire experience of traveling. Unbelievable!"

Americas Best Value Inn,"If you're just looking for a place to crash for the night at a budget price this is the place. It is located downtown so you need to travel off the interstate a bit. It is very dated, but was very clean and you can't beat the price. You will hear your neighbors since this place is not well insulated."
Americas Best Value Inn,We were spending two nights in North Platte and basically needed just a place to sleep. Americas Best Value Inn fit the bill. Our room was comfortable and very adequate. Parking is tight and some is located on a side street. We did not use the pool.
Americas Best Value Inn,"If you're expecting a fancy five-star hotel, it's helpful to remember that you're visiting North Platte, Nebraska, not Palm Springs. Get over yourself, lol. This motel is very clean and comfortable, and we really appreciated being able to bring our dog. We were here on a chilly weekend and loved being able to take long, hot showers. The staff was... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,The best part of this stay was the room was clean. The service was poor. The parking lot was lousy. Clerk said I could park my truck and utility trailer across the street at a tire shop. Called the police and was told not to park the truck there and the management was told not to tell people to park... More
Americas Best Value Inn,"This is an older motel reasonably maintained and clean. If you need a clean, safe place to sleep for the night it will suffice. The downside of this motel is it location. It is next to the Firestone tire store and across from the NAPPA parts store, but I needed neither tires nor auto parts, what I needed was dinner.... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"This is definitely a very basic, no-frills sort of hotel. Rather dated, but our room was clean. The main problem was that we think we discovered the world's noisiest air conditioners here. Honestly, our unit was so loud we thought a Harley was being reved-up within our room. That, combined with a rather soft bed, led to a very poor... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Arrived late (around midnight) for check in. Looked like a roadside drive-in motel. Well lit, though. Parking lot was very small, completely full, difficult to turn around in. Parked across the street at the Firestone. Manager was very pleasant welcoming. Pets stay free! Room bath were very dated, but, no smells. Small flat screen TV, but, cords... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"It's modest, but clean ... and a refrigerator We were road-tripping across the country for a move from Chicago to LA when our alternator blew. After being towed into town, our tow truck driver brought us to Traveler's Inn on 4th Street. Because we were moving, we had our dog and cat in tow, so we needed a pet friendly option, and this modest motel filled the bill. The room was pretty basic, but it was clean, and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine. The TV had cable including HBO. There also is a pool out front, but it was closed as it was still early in the spring. The motel also is AAA approved, so if you have a card, you get a discount. There are a few nearby dining options, too, including a Taco John's and a old-time diner. Convenience stores also dot 4th street. Overall, it was very comfortable, pet friendly and cheap. Just what we needed for our short stay in North Platte."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Free coffee refills and budget rates make this motel tops with highway travelers. In ShortThe first Super 8 opened in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1974, charging 8.88 a night. Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations."
Americas Best Value Inn,"There were no amenities, 1 chair, 1night stand, bed good, shower good not great, breakfast poor. Thank goodness I always carry soap and shampoo in my kit. Very dated even though advertised as remodeled, room looked clean but felt dirty. Didn't seem pleased I booked through hotel.com"
Americas Best Value Inn,"About what you'd expect for a less expensive night's stay. Clean, somewhat updated recently, but nothing fancy. Located off of I25 on the northern outskirts of Cheyenne, across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses. Several noisy trains went by during the evening, although they didn't wake me during the night. Several other, newer hotels in the immediate area, but not many places to eat or get gas."
Americas Best Value Inn,"clean, comfortable, helpful staff"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel smells pretty bad. Cleaning lady walked in on me naked at 9am. Could use some work (cracked ceiling, burnt sheets in non smoking room, rusty gross tub, paper thin walls, some of the lights didn't work). Would not recommend unless you really, really, really, need to save money."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was nice. The potholes turning into the motel were awful.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room smelled bad, the carpet was dirty everywhere you go, downstairs and upstairs"
Americas Best Value Inn,The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and very affordable for my purposes. The breakfast was excellent.
Americas Best Value Inn,Very clean and convenient
Americas Best Value Inn,clean room and great shower
Americas Best Value Inn,"Surprisingly comfortable stay. Just stopped in for the night while traveling across country. Pool for the kids to swim in and burn off some energy was small, but it existed and did its job. Breakfast was good. I'd stay again if I was passing through."
Americas Best Value Inn,We stayed there twice during our round trip. It was great that there were enough beds for a family of six. That rarely happens. The pool was tiny and the breakfast was lacking. But obviously it was alright because we went back on the way home.
Americas Best Value Inn,The only thing the room needed is new pillows. Good location. We just stayed 1 night.
Americas Best Value Inn,I was not pleased with my room as the bed had bed bugs on it.
Americas Best Value Inn,Very run down and not very clean. Air conditioner didn't work!!!
Americas Best Value Inn,The room is clean. The location is very convenient.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Very nice hotel, friendly, helpful, staff. Clean, well-situated, very good breakfast. I recommend this hotel very highly!"
Americas Best Value Inn,everything was fine except the sofa bed was broken so I had to sleep on the couch itself. My friends were fine in their beds.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We chose this place on the price and just because we needed a stopover on a long road trip. Was surprisingly awesome so we chose to stay here on the way back as well! Its not the most fancy or newly refurnished but the beds were clean, and super comfy, the rooms were spacious and the service was super friendly and helpful. The hot tub was kinda small, but just hot enough and nice and deep so super relaxing. The pool is also really nice, clean and welcoming. Highly recommended, pet and family friendly!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel is old. We got in late but I needed to shower and the tub was SUPER loud. Every time I moved around, it cracked and creaked. Not to mention that the shower head was sticking out of a big hole on the wall. It was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel. Although, for the price, I guess I can't really complain. The neighborhood was okay. I don't think there was much to do around but we were just there to sleep and hit the road."
Americas Best Value Inn,"clean, comfortable. Great desk clerk, very polite and accomodating. No problem with train noise, didn't even hear them. Room heater was a little noisy, but didn't interfere with my sleep. Great value, would stay there again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Good pricing ... Nice pool
Americas Best Value Inn,We got registered OK but the room shook the whole night as if a train was going by and the front desk had no explanation. Got no sleep which made the next day of driving difficult.
Americas Best Value Inn,Pasing through moving from CA to MI. They had parking for a 50ft long vehicle (UHaul plus trailer). The parking location wasn't great but they had security cameras on it and we were only there a few hours - in late and out early. There was a mistake in check in and we initially got a room already occupied. Mgmt was very apologetic and rebooked us to a different room right away (and checked to make sure no one was already there.) :)
Americas Best Value Inn,"Our room was a 'recently' converted from a smoking room. The only 'conversion' was the sign on the door as non smoking. We had to use our own clothes as pillows due to the smell of the room pillows. The sheets were clean, but the blanket between also smelled. The front desk had no other room to place us or spray to mask the smell. we only stayed because it was paid for. It was the front desk agent that explained the stench."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Booked this hotel while traveling cross country. It was ok, I wouldnt book agsin. The bathtub squeeked and sounded like it wasnt installed correctly. No hairdryer, towels were small and well worn. Mustly smell in hall and flat pillows."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I don't really like to complain, but our stay here was terrible. When we walked in the lobby, it didn't look too bad, and we could tell it had been recently updated a bit. When we got in the room, and were setting down our things, I noticed a hair on the bed. I don't really tolerate hair in a clean hotel room, but I threw it away and let it go. When I was helping my daughter wash her hands soon after, the soap dispenser on the wall fell, and then I could tell the bathroom counter and sink were not cleaned, and there was more hair in the sink. The kids were excited to swim, so we ignored this mess and went to the pool. The pool was fine, but the hot tub was very murky. After swimming, we went back to the room and when I pulled the covers down in the bed, there were 2 more hairs. It was late, and we were tired, so I cleaned them up. In the morning, when I opened the shower curtain to take a shower, there was hair hanging from the shower faucet, and then from the towels! I couldn't handle anymore grossness, and we packed up and left. No one in my family got ready that morning, and there was no one one at the front desk to talk to. We skipped breakfast, because we were leary of how anything was really cleaned. I am extremely disappointed in this stay, as hair everywhere is not OK, not excusable. We will not be staying here, or probably any America's Best's, again."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Not a very nice hotel, old furniture and bath. Disappointed in the price we paid in hotel.com and the price the hotel would have given us for the room."
Americas Best Value Inn,Cheap hotel.
Americas Best Value Inn,Our stay was comfortable and the housekeeping staff was fabulous.
Americas Best Value Inn,My rate tells everything
Americas Best Value Inn,"Great value! SUper friendly, super comfortable, super clean! Totally worth the price :"
Americas Best Value Inn,Hotel was clean but needs updates.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Needs updating: A/C top lid broke, bathroom light cover missing, no sink stopper, smelled smokey, noisy with hearing neighbors walking around hall/room, not impressed with breakfast, long black hair in shower from previous guests. Will not return."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room was nice, the but the air conditioning was not that good!"
Americas Best Value Inn,This location was budget friendly. Breakfast was ok. Beds so-so. Hotel staff was friendly. Super easy access to downtown as well as access to the interstate.
Americas Best Value Inn,It's not modern. The couch was broke. Musty smell. Just not worth the money in my opinion.
Americas Best Value Inn,Our stay was pleasant. The Staff was helpful. Motel was clean but facilities were older. Bathrooms were old style but clean. Breakfast was above a continental. It was fine for one night. Convenient to the highway.
Americas Best Value Inn,Not enough wash clothes. Bathtub drain dirty. Only one chair to sit down. Bed fairly comfortable.
Americas Best Value Inn,Ok just ok close To train tracks so noisy
Americas Best Value Inn,"First room looked like someone had already used the bed, but the gentleman at the front desk was very apologetic and moved us to a upgraded room."
Americas Best Value Inn,After a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old son I was ready to just sleep. We walk in the room and right when you walk in it smells like marijuana and cigarettes. I was instantly disgusted. There were burn marks on the sink and an ash tray in a non smoking room. I go down to the lobby and ask for lysol or something and I spray it in the room still doesn't help. I go back to take lysol and I tell them I'm not paying for this room. It smells horendous. They tell me they'really sorry and will give me 10 discount and at first that's all they could do and I told him the only reason I'm still staying here is because we drove 15-16 hours and we're all exhausted. So he gives us a queen room and a roll-away bed. I go to the bathroom and have to go to the bathroom with the door open because THE LIGHT WOULDN'T TURN ON! The food was alright. Pretty basic. Then when we checked out we didn't even get the 10 discount!!!! I'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't be called America's best it should be called American horror.
Americas Best Value Inn,The hotel is newly remodeled but done cheaply. It looked clean until you started looking too closely. My sheets were no longer white (white being there original color) and there were holes in the fitted sheet. The hotel staff was very nice but definitely understaffed.
Americas Best Value Inn,A nice inexpensive place to stay...Good breakfast as well..
Americas Best Value Inn,"The reception staff was friendly and willing to help us haul all our luggage up the stairs since there wasn't an elevator. The room and the hallway had a really funky smell that made us gag a bit. Not sure what that was! The room also seemed to be tilted a bit and lacked a bit on cleanliness. The AC didn't work and we had to sleep with the window open. Situated between the freeway and train tracks, made for a noisy night. Friendly staff was the only positive."
Americas Best Value Inn,EASY ON AND OFF HWY 70
Americas Best Value Inn,"Needs upkeep, several things broke. Staff could be friendlier."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The staff were very polite, and accomodating. Very pleased. Do not let the look of outside of the hotel fool you, the inside was comfortable, clean, and quiet."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel was clean. No coffee pot, soaps, or laundry bag in room. Shampoo dispenser in shower. Breakfast missing butter."
Americas Best Value Inn,Staff was not friendly.
Americas Best Value Inn,Used this motel because was close to the highway we needed
Americas Best Value Inn,Overall good value for your money Wifi didn't work pretty well
Americas Best Value Inn,Nice motel the only thing I don't understand is why they had the doors to outside made so they wouldn't latch
Americas Best Value Inn,Same as above
Americas Best Value Inn,"No frills, clean hotel. Nice breakfast. Would stay here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Only problem was the train across the road but the windows block 98 of the noise I would stay again for sure
Americas Best Value Inn,"Traveling from Okc, Ok to Rawlins, Wy . Good stopping point. Very easy to get to, clean, comfortable , pet friendly"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Large clean rooms, comfy beds, friendly staff. Great for a quick, affordable stay when passing through."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room was clean but very cheap. Hotel is in desperate need of updating, especially for the price. Not really worth the 100 we paid for one night. Have stayed in much nicer spots for the same price. It was clean and serviceable, staff was great."
Americas Best Value Inn,"This hotel offered us exactly what we needed for a quick stop-over in Cheyenne, WY. Easy access, affordable nightly rate, clean room and comfortable bed, indoor pool and Jacuzzi to refresh. We would definitely stay here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Hotel was smelly. Had no luggage carrier or elevator. Not for elderly. Rooms were clean.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Loud,poor breakfast"
Americas Best Value Inn,this hotel gave my family room for 6 away and told me that hotels.com canceled it. so I had had to 2 rent rooms for almost twice the money. the rooms smelled like a pet toilet. it was the worst hotel I've stayed in. also something not in the fine print the train goes by every half an hour all night long.
Americas Best Value Inn,It's a bargain hotel for a reason. The free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out anyway. The room was clean. The beds were comfy. Flat plastic pillows. The AC is either freezing or roasting. No elevator. Stayed 5 nights our key cards stopped working at least twice. only have us new towels once and that was the day after checking in. Staff was helpful with the key card problem
Americas Best Value Inn,Enjoyed our stay very much. Very restful. Would like to see items like bagels for your continental breakfast.
Americas Best Value Inn,Rooms werent great and breakfast was so-so.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Old coke bottle and flat plate under the bed. Internet iffy at times. Iron and board available at front desk. No workout room. I need those things, others might not."
Americas Best Value Inn,Had problems with our reservation but the clerk was very nice. Room was nice. The only complaint is there is no elevator
Americas Best Value Inn,"Motel entry area smelled but room was comfortable. Went to town for dinner... town was a dive, luckily found an Outback, next to Home Depot, behind the motel. Only decent place we saw to eat. Staff was courteous and eager to please. Offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us afraid of continental breakfasts..."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was a good deal for what I paid. I would stay again.
Americas Best Value Inn,Stayed overnight while traveling on I-25.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We needed a place to stay for one night. We were worried when we saw the run down location but the inside was very pleasant. The staff were very nice and the rooms were fine. nice furnishings and bedding.I read a lot of reviews that mentioned the close proximity to the interstate and train tracks, and whileven you could hear them both, it was. otherwise as bad as some people described"
Americas Best Value Inn,"We checked in late as planned. when we went to our room, we found someone already in the room we were assigned to. There were no deadbolts or safety locks on the doors, so we were able to just walk in. They did give us another room,and went along to make sure the new room was an empty room."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Very good, reserved our room at 9:00 pm and they got us in a room when we got there at 11:00 pm"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Richard at the desk was amazing - friendly, helpful, and patient"
Americas Best Value Inn,This hotel was nice but next to the train tracks so you heard trains all night long. You might want to ask for a room away from the tracks. There is a lot of interstate construction so some exits are closed and you had to drive around town to make connections. There won't always be construction so don't let that keep you from staying here. There is an Outback Restaurant two doors down so food is available in the area. The WY State Capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and currently under renovation as well but the downtown area is very easy to walk and there are a lot of little shops and restaurants to spend time in. The management staff was very helpful and full of information about the area. It was nice to talk to someone who knew so much about the local area and was so friendly. It makes you feel like your not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff.
Americas Best Value Inn,OK but don't think I would stay there again.
Americas Best Value Inn,"What a great stay for a small price. The room was super spacious, very clean, had a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, ironing board, iron. The beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom was wonderful and huge! Log cabin feeling you will love. The casino, food and service were wonderful as well."
Americas Best Value Inn,A good basic motel with all the essential ammenities. Would definitely stay here again
Americas Best Value Inn,After paying through hotels.com they required a separate deposit on my cc. Room was facing railroad tracks and highway but the worst part was the beds!!! Cheap foam with some kind of rubber bag around them so it crinkled with every movement. One thin sheet and cheap blanket and no comforter!! It's winter outside!!
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room was fine but needs updating. You can tell they've tried to spruce it up some, but it needs things like more outlets and some USB plugs. Employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was pretty boring. The bed was pretty comfy. Nice TV."
Americas Best Value Inn,The bathroom sink was loose and bath door handle slide off
Americas Best Value Inn,"Just a one-night stay passing through Cheyenne, great location close to the Interstate, nice hotel"
Americas Best Value Inn,"The only thing in this room that was remodeled is the flat screen tv. The shower had no water pressure, the bathroom fan was very loud. The bed was sort of comportable. The bathroom sink was low to the ground and the faucet was spitting water everywhere."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The guest service was very rude at check-in, and then kicked all the guests out of the pool just because he can. The hallway on the second floor stunk of smoke and made our eyes tear up. Also our room A/C could not keep the room properly conditioned. The shower was not cleaned either."
Americas Best Value Inn,This hotel was awful.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Main issue with this room: You can only connect one wi-fi device at one time. When you have several people with phones, iPads and a laptop, this was a challenge. Otherwise, enjoyed my stay."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was very impressive to stay in a budget priced hotel that has such quality features.
Americas Best Value Inn,I was glad to soak in the hot tub. I had to make many phone calls in the morning before I could get on the road. They were patient for my check out time after explaining that a truck had taken my side mirror off of the Uhaul that I was driving and needed to get it replaced.
Americas Best Value Inn,a good value
Americas Best Value Inn,"Staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was okay. I'm GF so I just had yogurt and a banana but they had some good options. Rooms have been partially remodeled. New beds, bed linens and furniture (including tv). The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. Bathrooms are still old fixtures but were clean. No blow dryers in rooms ladies. Only soap and shampoo dispensers, no individual bottles. Bottom line, for about 60 it was a good value. You're not getting nicer ammenities but your not paying for them either. If you need a quick overnight stay, it's a good option."
Americas Best Value Inn,This place was disgusting with a nasty bathroom and stained sheets. I did not stay at this location and left immediately after seeing the room. When I try to get my refund from Expedia the hotel manager tried to tell them I stay there. I did not and will not recommend it to anyone. Don't book this hotel.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I looked at over 15 different motels in Cheyene, Kimball and Sidney looking for a good motel. This was a home rune hit. It had ok reviews and a reasonable price. When we arrived I was surprised how clean and nice it really was. We had stayed at another American Best a week earlier which was a 3 so this was a great surprise. Staff was polite and professional. I will stay here again"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Good service and great breakfast. Area is not appealing, but it seemed safe."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel was clean, comfortable and good continental breakfast"
Americas Best Value Inn,The guy who checked us in was very helpful. The room was large and well maintained and the breakfast was good.
Americas Best Value Inn,Non smoking room smelled like smoke. Not good.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, however, if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs! You can hear the slamming doors and people talking out in the hall."
Americas Best Value Inn,Was disappointing that the times of checkout and pool times were wrong on the website. Hot tub wasn't very hot. No coffee pot in the room. Other than that it was ok.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Tv remote didn't work, got a second floor room but no elevator, had to carry luggage up two flutes of stairs. Not impressed."
Americas Best Value Inn,The staff is excellent but they could not get the noisy and running children to quiet down after four hrs and multiple requests to be quiet and stop running and making excessive noise.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Quick stop on my way thru. Helpful, friendly desk staff for a late check in and check out. Hotel is a little tired, but serviceable for a quick rest stop."
Americas Best Value Inn,Looks can be deceiving. Doesn't look that great pulling up but it's pretty descent on the inside. Very nice pool. Clean room and bathroom. Nice staff. Even though recently updated it still looks a little dated.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I actually stayed at this same hotel at this same time last year. They have done a lot to improve it since then and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay this time. It wasn't horrible last time but given a year's time, I could see the improvements they have made. The beds are VERY comfortable and the WiFi is good. Looks like they've done painting, etc. as well. Staff is still friendly and welcoming and efficient. Really enjoyed the stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,Average hotel offering a good nights sleep.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The towels are really rough, the pool/spa had way to much chlorine. Marie was wonderful at the front desk! There was another lady who was VERY unprofessional, rude and stood talking on a personal phone call while I waited to be check out. I can't remember her name or I'd pass it forward. The breakfast was puke. The juices tasted partially fermented and the coffee burnt....we stayed there 3 days and it was like this every morning. I will never stay here again"
Americas Best Value Inn,"From the moment we pulled into the hotel, I knew it was not going to be a pleasant stay. The man who checked us in was not friendly at all, didn't greet us and acted like we were interrupting his day by being there. Our room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it hadn't been updated since 1990. Internet didn't work and when I asked if there was something that could be done, the girl at the desk said no, they were having issues and WiFi was out, no apology, no explanation or compensation for the inconvenience. Location of hotel was terrible, very noisy and the outside door was broken so it was a major pain to get in and out of hotel (and with a dog, this made things very difficult to take him out). I would never stay here again, do yourself a favor and book another hotel"
Americas Best Value Inn,"The newly refurbished rooms don't seem to be refurbished as much as painted. The shower leaked and didn't have a plunger for baths. The bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible. The staff was fairly friendly, though. I won't be staying here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel was a basic room, good for a one-night stopover on a trip. It could use some refreshing - its getting kind of tired and run down."
Americas Best Value Inn,Economical and convenient for overnight stay on our way.
Americas Best Value Inn,was good hot bfast and very nice staff. water didn't smell like bleach. train track across from street and highway too but we knew that going in.
Americas Best Value Inn,No elevator - be in shape.. No luggage carts - pack light. South room face railroad tracks - light sleepers take note. Limited places to plug in your laptop - bring an extension cord.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was very nice, but both a ending machine and the laundry facilities were out of order. Also, the area outside the hotel should be cleaned up to make it more attractive."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Really decent ABVI! I've had a mix of experiences across the country with this chain, and this location is somewhere above the median. Really clean, affordable, easy to access, well staffed, quiet, wifi was decent (had some trouble moments mid-evening when everyone around me was on it), and service dog friendly."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was nice, clean,. Beds were comfortable, nice view and very easy access. Good breakfast. Staff was friendly and attentive"
Americas Best Value Inn,"In town for a conference at Little America. This is a half mile away. Rooms only a little smaller, but almost half the price. Room was perfectly fine. Halls smelled a little funny, as in many hotels, but room was fine. I was in the Little America rooms and was happy we weren't staying there. Even though that's more high quality, supposedly, the value for my money was far higher at this place."
Americas Best Value Inn,"WiFi could not even download an audio book overnight that normally takes minutes. Not sure what it looked like before renovation. The day desk staff was busy on his cell phone so we checked ourselves out. The bathroom smelled like sewer but the tub enclosure was clean. There was a 1/4 gap around the door letting in most sound from the hall. Finally, it was twice the price it was worth."
Americas Best Value Inn,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
Americas Best Value Inn,"Stayed 3 night, enjoyed the pool, continental breakfast was good, and hotel was clean and in pretty good shape. Staff was friendly and helpful."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Not the nicest motel in the world, but it was clean. Towels were pretty scratchy. Breakfast came with biscuits and gravy but no eggs. Shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion are in wall pump dispensers... so good for the environment but really cheap product inside. It was a decent stop over on our way out west."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I stayed for 4 nights the room and service from the hotel staff was more than adequate for the location, cost was the deciding factor it was very reasonable and the access in and out of the facility in relation to business and roads was very good."
Americas Best Value Inn,Staff was accommodating and polite. Light was out over the table.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Budget place to spend several nights. Big rooms, comfortable beds."
Americas Best Value Inn,Easy check in and the people was pleasant. They did everything they could to help. And to answer any questions.
Americas Best Value Inn,Run down need paint and repair getting Brett bad even for a cheep place
Americas Best Value Inn,"This was a horrible stay. I check out a day early and upgraded to the Motel 6 next door. After a 9 hour drive my husband, 9 month old son and I arrived at this dump and were shocked to learn the motel had no record of our reservation. After phone calls to Hotels.com by both the desk clerk and my husband, showing the confirmation email with confirmation number on his phone and showing the credit card used to book the room with my ID the clerk finally realized it would be very bad to turn away a paying guest including me a woman who uses a wheelchair fulltime to look for a room late in the evening before Thanksgiving. He finally came to his senses and gave us a single key to a room. The clerk was proud to point out that he upgraded to a room with 2 queen size beds because 2 beds is better than one when everyone sleeps in the same bed. He did suggest our son could sleep on the bed alone! There's no way we're going to risk his safety by letting him sleep alone, above a dirty floor that is hard as concrete. The one thing we asked for and didn't get was a wheelchair accessible bathroom. However we did get a dirty bathroom, a toilet I had to ask my husband for help getting on and off of, a dresser with broken drawers, a missing smoke detector and a TV with 3 remote controls and ONE channel. The night clerk pointed out to another guest that this motel had more TV channels than the Motel 6 next door. Our stay at the Motel 6 next door proved this was not the case."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Overall ok experience for the price, the room was obviously not cleaned ( the toilet was dirty and a couple towels had a couple wet/dirty spots) thank goodness I brought my own!"
Americas Best Value Inn,The room was OK...TV was old and in need of repair....No safe....AC needed service and repair.
Americas Best Value Inn,"the motel was clean. Very basic, no hair dryer in the room, had to go to the front desk and ask to use the one they kept in the office. The breakfast was very basic, cereal, bread,english muffins and waffles. Cranberry juice was really water down. Folks running the front desk were friendly. Nice big bath tub, however. Small refrigerator and microwave in the room. Seemed like an older motel, no real new updates. Like the breakfast the motel was basic. You get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive motel."
Americas Best Value Inn,When we got their we immediately had to switch rooms because the TV modem was not working in room 223. The next room didn't have a clock on the center nightstand like the other but did have a mini fridge. The second room had a ant problem around the sink area. The beds were firm. The door deadbolt didn't work on room 227. FYI
Americas Best Value Inn,Fine
Americas Best Value Inn,"Room in bad shape, not clean. NO hot water during cold Xmas weekend. Don't stay there!"
Americas Best Value Inn,The worst room i have ever stayed in..room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go buy lysol and spray everything. Sheets were dirty and one had a blood stain..room parking was next to a broken down car someone appeared to be living in..if we had had any other option we would have left..will never stay there again!
Americas Best Value Inn,We have stayed here twice now and both times there was a problem with the tub...the first time it didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there...the cleaning and bed making were minimal.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We booked here on a holiday weekend thinking we would be traveling with our two dogs. Pet friendly and reasonably priced. Changed our plans and did not have dogs with us, but all the other hotels were booked up and jacked up their prices because of the holiday. Arrived and the front office lady was very nice and reminded me we had a smoking room (all that they had left at booking) and no non-smoking rooms had opened up. I said I knew and we would deal with it. She said she hated cigarette smoke and that the room would smell. She had an odd look on her face and said do you want to go see the room first My husband and I looked at each other and decided maybe we needed to do that. We opened the door and I almost cried. He wouldn't even walk inside. It was soooooo filthy and the smell was so strong we knew we would not be able to stay there. We went back to the desk and told here we couldn't stay and she said she understood and there would be no charge for late cancellation. We asked her if she knew of any other places that might have a vacancy. She told us to try the Super 8. I am grateful to the lady here (I think her name was Mindy) who was so nice and honest. We did get a non-smoking room at Super 8 and all was well."
Americas Best Value Inn,"A previous stay at an ABMI in a different location was very satisfactory, therefore I decided to try this location. I was very disappointed with the housekeeping even after I told the manager my concerns."
Americas Best Value Inn,"This hotel was a switch from Motel 6 next door, as they messed up our reservation. The room was nice. Comfortable and good beds. The only negative I would state is that the carpets need cleaning badly. Every time I got in the shower I left dirty footprints, and, due to diabetic foot problems, I do not walk outside bare footed. The only place the soil could have come from was within the room."
Americas Best Value Inn,Very cheap hotel.... if your only sleeping its ok but not of quality
Americas Best Value Inn,Overall good stay but the pool is very very small...
Americas Best Value Inn,Tub slow to drain. Calf deep
Americas Best Value Inn,"We were in town for a memorial service and needed an inexpensive place to stay for a couple of nights. They -advertised a continental breakfast, microwave and refrigerator and sounded just right for our needs. In reality, there was a micro with the door broken off, so as long as you could pry the door open you were in business! As for the continental breakfast, well, it supposedly went from 7-10, but when we came in at 8:30 the bins with some little rolls and english muffins were almost empty and I watched as the lady ahead of me grabbed the last one and no refills were coming. there was one kind of cereal and a couple packets of oatmeal and milk plus coffee and some juice. If everything was about gone at 8:30, imagine coming in an hour later...The hotel didn't seem to be all that busy either. All in all, the hotel was certainly tolerable, but not quite what they lead you to believe."
Americas Best Value Inn,Cheap and place to sleep. Great for overnight.
Americas Best Value Inn,It was safe
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was disappointing, and changed to another which was okay realizing the quality when we got there!"
Americas Best Value Inn,It was a okay. It wasn't that bad or that good. It was comfortable.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The TV is this motel is old and no cable, there's only one channel, but there is wifi. Breakfast is ok waffles, oatmeal, bread and English muffin. Coffee, tea and juice."
Americas Best Value Inn,"As usual expedia was able to set me up to exactly what I needed.. A quick one night stay, while I conducted my business."
Americas Best Value Inn,I checked in late in the night and the person at the reception was very rude. Other than that the stay was good.
Americas Best Value Inn,The mattress was too small for the frame so everytime I would get up or walk past the bed I hit my ankle on the bed frame. Room was clean.
Americas Best Value Inn,Our stay was pleasant. Staff was nice and accomodating. Had to go to office to get toilet paper. The room was pretty much clean. The location was great a short drive to Reno or Lake Tahoe. Down the road from the reilroad museum. I was kind of sceptical about staying there based on previous reviews but the reviews were worse than I expected. I would stay there again. If you are not looking for luxury and just need a place to stay I would recommend this place. Continental breakfast as well.
Americas Best Value Inn,An ok place to stay a night on a road trip but over priced for the condition of the room. Fairly clean but really run down for the price paid.
Americas Best Value Inn,"This hotel was rented for a friend that smokes. It was a pleasant surprise it was clean, friendly, and comfortable. Our guest said he would happily return on his next trip."
Americas Best Value Inn,"It's more like a 40 dollar a night room , but Us bikers we not picky rooms are in need of updating couple rooms down from us had mice running up and down the curtains so I'll give the rooms a 3 out of 10 this should be the last hotel you pick ... Over all on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd say it's a good 4"
Americas Best Value Inn,They dont wash blanket or bedsheet well. Hair found in bedsheet. Blanket is dirty and carpet is very dirty. It left black mark on the feet as it is so dirty. Everything is filthy in rooms. AC does not work
Americas Best Value Inn,Bathroom was filthy. Heater was not working.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Really dirty, but we weren't in the room very much so we lived with it. Will never go there again. Staff was somewhat helpful."
Americas Best Value Inn,Very convenient great staff
Americas Best Value Inn,"Decent room. Had fridge, microwave, and TV. Did not have a hair dryer. Tub drained very slowly, carpet was visibly dirty in routinely traveled corners, and the set of sheets for my second night had a small blood stain on them. Quiet though, so good enough place to crash."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Overnight stop on motorcycle trip. This place was easy to find, but there is not much around. There is a single diner-style restaurant an easy walk across the parking lot, but plenty of options if you're willing to drive. The breakfast was nothing special. Staff were nice. Totally adequate for a budget overnight stay."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Stayed at this motel while playing a softball tournament in north Tahoe upon arrival very easy check in the hotel is a old hotel but kept as well as it can be. Clean very quite nice people ,pool is very old but wAter is clean. No fridge and micro like they said and breakfast was horrible . Landry facilities are great and open all night which is great since we got back late and had softball uniforms to wash over all great place to stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Lobby employee was the rudest and most unprofessional person I've ever encountered at a motel. While paying, he was arguing with another guest and holding my credit card. I was so frightened by his aggressiveness, I went to car and found another location to stay at. I believe he was under the influence. Hotels.com employee, Mar, told me I would have to call motel manager, Nikki on Monday to get a refund. I will never use either company again."
Americas Best Value Inn,"great hotel staff,clean rooms,small but comfortable,,rates are the best in the area"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I checked in at 230am on 11/26 I apologized to the worker for waking him up to check in and receive my keys, but he was still pretty rude with me."
Americas Best Value Inn,I CANCELLED AND HAD TO PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL TWO ROOMS THIS PLACE WAS SO DIRTY I WOULD NOT ALLOW MY SISTER OR MOTHER STAY LOCATED A ROOM IN A NEARBY TOWN FOR THEM
Americas Best Value Inn,"Accommodations were fairly standard, but I was very impressed with the immaculate room. Totally neutral smelling with a functioning microwave and mini-fridge added to my comfort. Minor inconveniences: Hot/Cold were reverse in the shower, and TV remote would not adjust volume or on/off."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The staff is nice enough and the room cleanish but still sub par compared to the Motel 6 next door. It appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot. I can't fault this hotel for being crappy as the price was a bargain but I do fault Expedia for misrepresenting this as a 2+ star hotel (Mystery Hotel crappy hotel, buyer beware ). Expedia is the worst, I am so done with them."
Americas Best Value Inn,I slept most of my time. But otherwise had a good time.
Americas Best Value Inn,"room smells really bad, though it's a smoke room. air conditioner is very loud and it's filthy inside. price might be lower than others, you get what you pay for. i stayed also at topaz lodge, it's also a smoke room, but very clean, no smell at all. price is almost the same."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I wasn't expecting a 5 star stay, but wasn't prepared for the hole in the wall, no lock on the bathroom door, shower shooting all over, or the ants and ripped carpet. Or the carpet so dirty my kids feet were black. And walls so thin we couldn't sleep because our neighbors were having a good time till 4am. For 100 a night, I expected at least decent. Never again!"
Americas Best Value Inn,"You get what you pay for... rooms dated, somewhat dirty. Liked in-room coffee and location."
Americas Best Value Inn,I would not recommend this hotel at all it was very dirty to the point I cancelled the other rooms and had the other guest stay at another location
Americas Best Value Inn,I would not recommend this hotel.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Hotel is in terrible condition. Bathtub would not drain properly, toilet would not flush properly, toilet seat looked like WWII surplus. No electrical outlets for computer etc. This is the second worst hotel I have ever stayed in."
Americas Best Value Inn,This was a older motel with limited upgrading. It was OK.
Americas Best Value Inn,Comfortable and a good value.
Americas Best Value Inn,Just ok
Americas Best Value Inn,"I had a confirmed 2 rooms booking to this hotel through hotels.com. When I tried to checkin at the hotel, the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name. He squarely blamed it on hotels.com because of a computer glitch they had. I believe he double sold the rooms, as he was well aware of my name even before I told him mine. I would like you guys to double check and confirm your booking at this hotel"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Stayed at this motel while playing a softball tournament in north Tahoe upon arrival very easy check in the hotel is a old hotel but kept as well as it can be. Clean very quite nice people ,pool is very old but wAter is clean. No fridge and micro like they said and breakfast was horrible . Landry facilities are great and open all night which is great since we got back late and had softball uniforms to wash over all great place to stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel location is probably the only good thing about it. It is relatively close to the freeway and eateries, but everything else about it is one star at best. There was some kind of brown food splattered on the outside of the bathroom door. There was something brown crusted on the inside of the toilet ( not what you think). There was no soap or shampoo in the dispensers in the shower. There was a burn mark from where someone left an iron face down on the bench, next to the sink. The bathroom fan barely worked and was very loud. There was a dead moth in the AC. Our room was on the side opposite from the front desk, and we had really spotty WiFi. The free breakfast is pastries cut in half, frozen waffles, white bread, cheerios, and tiny apples, I ended up eating food that I had brought myself."
Americas Best Value Inn,Never again!!! Dirty and smelly
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel was disappointing. We did not receive room cleaning or replacing linens service during the two nights we stayed. Not worth the stay for the price. The only god point about the hotel was the very nice desk clerk at check-in. We arrived at 10:30pm exhausted from travel and the clerk was pleasant, helpful and willing to come to the room to show us how to operate the tv."
Americas Best Value Inn,"People for the breakfast, not friendly. Bagels still frozen."
Americas Best Value Inn,"pro: spacious, nice closet. cons: multiple light fixtures are either broken or without bulbs. wi-fi does not work. towels were used. toilet handle is broken. pubes in the shower and trash in the room."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Friday night in Monterey, nothing to be found. Nearest was Watsonville, so we found ourselves at the Best Value Inn. Close to the road, lots of traffic noise. Comfortable bed. Clean room, funky shower head. A bit pricy to be calling itself a best value."
Americas Best Value Inn,"We found ourselves in dire need of a place to stay when every place south of here to Monterey was full on an August Saturday night, so we didn't have time to research the amenities. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and courteous, but I guess I thought that we'd still get a coffee maker and kleenex... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"From the outside this hotel seems clean, the lobby is clean and the man behind the counter was nice. At a glance the room also seemed clean, it had a bit of a funky smell, but after removing the sanitized wrap from the toilet I was met with someone elses fecal matter on the toilet seat, and of course we had checked in very late so there was no one to come clean it, then when I was about to get into the shower I noticed several pieces of hair all over the walls and bottom of the shower. I would only recommend staying here if ALL other hotels are booked and you are faced with sleeping in your car, however choosing your car might be a more sanitary choice!"
Americas Best Value Inn,Nice double queen room. Very clean and bright. Nice quiet room. Great value for a holiday weekend when you have made no reservations anywhere! Most places wanted over 200 for one night - lots of run down places wanted more than that! This was fine for the price.
Americas Best Value Inn,Upon check-in the service was friendly. The room was very simple and plain and completely outdated. The bath tub had stains around the drain outlet. There is very little parking and not enough parking for everyone when the vacancy is full. We had to block in their laundry entrance since there was no partking available when we returned from the... More
Americas Best Value Inn,"I wasn't expecting a five star experience but overall I will say the staff was friendly, the room was clean, it did have a microwave and there was a free breakfast. Was there Egyptian cotton sheets No. Was there a wonderful view No. Was there an omelette chef at breakfast No, and asides from cereal and pastries that was it.... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I arrived late looking for a last minute room at 1am. The rude lady would not give me a discount . I paid a ridiculous amount for the disgusting room . It was dirty , tv remote didn't work , the promised microwave didn't exist , it was loud and when I called in the morning to request a later... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I have stayed at this chain before. However, This location was possibly the worst motel experience I have had in my life. My better half and myself were in town for a function and on a tight schedule. We wanted to get checked in get ready and go to the function. First off, we were given a tiny room. Smaller... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"You would be much better off paying an extra 20 to stay in a better location or better motel/hotel. I arrived at night, the street was was dark due to inadequate lighting. This place was not very easy to find as it was set back with very dark surroundings. It looked very run down from inside and out. My room... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,"Stayed here for one night whilst travelling around America, the room was very nice, no complaint's, the breakfast was very good, on the whole a pleasant night's stay, would stay again if in the area.."
Americas Best Value Inn,"This motel represents reasonable value for money but the area is not particularly attractive. The room was quite well furnished, clean and large enough. Breakfast was of limited quality and choice but adequate. There are several diners nearby."
Americas Best Value Inn,"lobby was locked, clerk was rude, room was old and in need of repair and it was very noisy."
Americas Best Value Inn,Stayed for one night. The room we got was a non smoking room walked in it smelled like smoke. Crack heads walking up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads. The bath room was dirty. The breakfast sucked. Don't recommend this place at all.
Americas Best Value Inn,"We had the room facing the street, and above the lobby at the top of the stairs. It was noisy, and our room smelled like it had not been used in many years, and like smoke. Twice during the night someone was using their card to try to get in to our room. The one guy said that he had been using the same room for a long time and then we resorted to telling him we were calling the police. Then he left us alone. The continental breakfast was a danish and an apple..I would not stay here again."
Americas Best Value Inn,Our complaints were met with an offer to move us to another room.....for 100.00 more. We were provided one towel for four people. We were disgusted.
Americas Best Value Inn,"When I checked in the guy in the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there. The room smelled moldy, and too many cigarette burns on the covers the list goes on mysterious bugs in the room nasty killed them without making a big deal to my family so they wouldn't freak but they were disgusting! That night I called to ask for 2 more additional towels and mins later we get a knock with only 1 towel in hand... Ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk and the guy there responded with adittude and said that the housekeeper was in our floor to go get towels from her... Ok not my job but ok no worries. So I go to the housekeepers cart and no towels. I call back and the guy rudely responded I'll try to get you towels what do you mean you'll try so he says 10-15 minute wait ok he hangs up..Next thing we hear a loud knock I'm thinking it's the towels and it was but the guy in front personally delivered them to yell at me asking me why didn't I fill out proper paperwork for how many guest where in the room and that we needed to do that before even staying I explained that the guy who checked me in did not ask me anything I only filled out the sheet of what kind of car I had..He was practically treating me like a child by the way he stood there scolding me about how many people where staying in the room and that why did we need so many towels by this time my fianc got up and told him about his bad customer service and closed the door in his fac"
Americas Best Value Inn,"The first night we stayed the t.v. was not working that well, killed 2 cockroachs. Then we needed to spend another night and the heater wasn't working so we called the front desk they said he had to go flip the breaker and give it 30 minutes it should start working. It didnt he said he called the manager and that she would give us a night free. We had some business to take care of early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room. We got back 2 hours after check out time thinking it was OK because we had a free night. Wrong the day manager said she couldn't do that and he could of moved us to a different room or gave us a heater. We had to run the hair dryer to keep the room some what comfortable. Had to pay for another night but was moved to a different room. The heater worked good and the t.v. was better. Will be calling America's best value Inn head quarters to complain about not only room conditions but not being comp for a free night. Not a good way to treat guests."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Good: someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk. They were nice enough to remember to give it to me when I checked in. Service people were nice and housekeeping did a good job. Bad: A/C kept cutting out after 10-30 minutes. Not having functional A/C in Chico in the middle of July is kind of important... The controls on the unit were relocated for your convenience to the wall near the bathroom. They also must have installed some sort of temperature or time limiter on it. Room got up to 83 before I went to the control unit and changed the fan from high to low in order to jump start the A/C unit again. Queen size bed was really a Full. Towels in bathroom were made for dwarves. Came late for breakfast, but all I saw were danishes, Fruit Loops, Captain Crunch, milk and apples. Better than nothing."
Americas Best Value Inn,Motel rooms are older but clean. Great water pressure and hot.
Americas Best Value Inn,There were people screaming until 4:00am. The door frame was coming apart from the wall. There were holes in the shower. There were people living in the hotel and digging through the trash in the morning. There was a smell of mildew in the room. People were smoking everywhere so i couldn't keep the window open for fresh air. This place is not safe for children or the elderly. They have to have armed security guards patrol regularly and they tell you so on a sticker in the window of the office. I would avoid this place at all costs.
Americas Best Value Inn,"The picture on the website didn't match the actual, the entrance door knob was upside down, after you swiped your key you had to lift the handle up instead of normally down to open the door a feature that would make you think your card isn't working. The bathtub wasn't seated it creaked every step you made in it while showering, and there was one towel on the rack, the drapes wouldn't completely close for privacy and there was one table for the continental breakfast. I thank God that it was a place to lay my head after a long day, I sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better."
Americas Best Value Inn,"When you open the door the smell was awful. Not sure what was causing the odor, but it was bad. My 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed, and I found someone's hair brush under the other bed. Needless to say they don't clean very well."
Americas Best Value Inn,You should not advertise cites like this. That is a cheap motel. Also your rate is extremely high for this type of places. While I was checking in. their standard rates is 40. I would not pay 25 for places like this. it is terrible!
Americas Best Value Inn,The room was dirty and outdated for 100 per night. Neighbors played loud music. The staff was rude.
Americas Best Value Inn,On a weekend when all downtown Chico hotels were booked out we knew smoking room would'nt be perfect before we arrived but even that did not prepare us for the stench in the room. Even my smoker husband thought the room reeked. We had to sleep with the window open. We've booked other smoking rooms last minute but this was the bottom of the barrel. The bedspreads smelled the worst and there were a few cigarette burn marks. The bathtub had a nasty brown stain in it and we're pretty sure the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. The sheets on the bed were clean however so that must be said. That alone saved us.
Americas Best Value Inn,It is not good experience to stay here. The room smells bad.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I was there for a concert at the Senator Theator, which was walking distance from this hotel. The neighborhood was quiet for a college town. And the hotel had everything I needed in it. (Mini fridge, microwave and iron) The staff was nice and worked with us when we had car troubles the next day. It's a nice little place."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Well now where do I start It wasn't the hypodermic needle in the parking lot, or the trash everywhere, or the disgusting trash cans with no liners, the phone not working at all, the boogers all over the bathroom ceiling, the broken showerhead, or the bloody sheets. It was the cops being there all night trying to get rid of the fighting permanent residents beating the walls, but hey at least we got to watch the cockroach races all night since we couldn't sleep. At least we had entertainment for the evening."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Location was nice to be within walking distance to Downtown Chico. A few of the occupants seemed to be long-term and sketchy. The continental breakfast did not meet normal standards. Overall, I might stay again, but will try another motel first."
Americas Best Value Inn,When I checked in I got a very uncomfortable feeling from the man that checked me in. I provided my credit card and license as asked. The next night I got a call from the fraud department of my bank stating there were multiple charges to my card when I had only used it one other time. I am still convinced it was the night clerk that did this. They gave me a double bed when I booked a queen size bed.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Have stayed here multiple times. Quiet everytime except last time. Some loud people talking outside in the middle of the night. Otherwise, convenient place to stay."
Americas Best Value Inn,"My son needed a room for his class reunion, so I booked this at the last minute. He ended up sleeping on a friends lawn chair instead because he couldn't tolerate the smell of the room."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Stayed 2 nights. Motel was clean and quiet. Wanted to use the pool, but it had just been shocked and was closed. Seemed strange to do it on a Sunday."
Americas Best Value Inn,"bathroom needed help, lots of damage, loud"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I think they are putting up drug addicts. Lots of people hanging out their doors was awakened at 4am by man beating a woman next door, was petrified that next gun shots would be coming.Would NeVER return."
Americas Best Value Inn,Just what we expected. Poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for the bike ride.
Americas Best Value Inn,"To see friends. Location was great. Hotel employees were great friendly. Physical building and room was a 2 on a 10 scale. Poor condition, shabby but clean. Tattered bed covers, broken bathroom tiles. Poor lighting. Poor conditions all around. Paid 105 per night worth 45 at best. Won't stay there again."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I do enjoy staying downtown, even though the hotels are all motels. But I like walking everyone and not having to drive. The problem is these rooms have thin walls and ceiling, so at all hours of the morning, I can hear people talking, laughing, sneezing, etc. The two worst times I've had downtown is the Alumni reunions. I happened to be there last year and again this year for an alumni reunion. But it's Chico -- just bring your ear plugs."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The room was mostly what we expected as we had stayed here before. The room was clean, but there was a tear in the carpet and the bedspread also had holes. We asked for a new bedspread and we were given one that was in better condition. The bathroom was clean and the shower was fantastic. There was a refrigerator in the room which was handy. There were good restaurants and shopping within walking distance as well as the Chico State campus. It was quiet and we slept well each night. It was a good choice for a bargain hotel."
Americas Best Value Inn,No tissue towels at all. Free continent breakfast was trouble. We checked in 1:00 am and just wanted to sleep few hrs.
Americas Best Value Inn,The office was wonderful and very helpful.
Americas Best Value Inn,No heat in the room. Scary gangster looking people hanging around. Torn sheets. Desk clerk acted surprise there was no heat in the room and gave us a space heater. How nice.
Americas Best Value Inn,"It was the worst stay I have ever had, lot of weird people on drugs hanging outside in parking lot. Hotel front staff was rude and unprofessional.front hotel restroom had number 2 stains in and on toilet,wouldn't recommend to anyone. Just disgusting!"
Americas Best Value Inn,A fast overnight stay
Americas Best Value Inn,Horrible!!!!
Americas Best Value Inn,It was so clean and the employees are very nice. Would stay there again
Americas Best Value Inn,"I loved Chico, and my stay at the Inn. Everything went well."
Americas Best Value Inn,It was good until I saw a roach crawling from the restroom to the bedroom
Americas Best Value Inn,REQUEST A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM ONLY OT BE TOLD AT CHECK IN NONE WERE AVAILABLE
Americas Best Value Inn,Floors soaked rude service twackers everywhere wont stay again
Americas Best Value Inn,"I by accident booked a smoking room, and wanted a non-smoking room. When I booked to a non-smoking room, all that was left was a king with a jacuzzi room, but I didn't want a jacuzzi room. Although I never booked a jacuzzi room originally, I was charged for a jacuzzi room."
Americas Best Value Inn,I believe they are putting up the homeless at this venue.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Besides a slight mix up at check-in, the room was great but there were very few working channels on the television."
Americas Best Value Inn,The hotel was dirty. The sheets and comforter has holes. I saw a cockroach in my room. The front desk lady had he daughter and was hanging out with two guys who smelled like bums and smoked outside the office. I would never stay here again.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I took a quick trip to Chico for my daughter's college orientation. Arrived at ABV later night the staff was courteous and quick check in. In the morning very simple complementary breakfast and again well assisted by the staff. The accommodations are reasonable and clean. You have what you've payed for. Quick in, quick out."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The first room I was placed in looked like something out of a horror movie. The window was broken in the open position... On the ground level facing the alley way. They placed me in a new room on the second floor that was better. I asked for a late check out ( which they said was no problem, but costs 10 per hour over). They forgot I was scheduled a late check out and called and started to berate me because I hadn't checked out yet... When I reminded them, they apologized and were nice. Only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we went through the same scenario."
Americas Best Value Inn,"The hotel is located at a major intersection of chico with a high amount of motorized and foot traffic. Hotel guests are constantly slamming doors and the room is functional, but nowhere near comfortable. Someone else's hair was already in the shower upon arrival. The toilet seat was broken. The bathroom and jacuzzi tub were way outdated and barely functional. This hotel is simply not worth any amount of your money!! Go somewhere else."
Americas Best Value Inn,This is the second time I stayed here. It was like a party atmosphere the first time so I shared that with the fella at the desk. Could I please have a quiet space in facility. I got the room beside the office and Ice Machine. Those machines make a lot of noise. Could hear TV all night in the next room and there was hair in my Bath Tub.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I chose this hotel because of the price, but I have stayed in nicer places for less in the past. The staff was pleasant at check-in and the parking seemed good. The room was small and needed to be updated. The tv was terrible and only about 18 channels were available. The shower floor needed new tile and the toilet had seen better days. The bed was ok, but 2 of the four light fixtures didn't work, and the two that did were barely holding together."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I booked on-line in order to visit Chico State. It was, as advertised, within walking distance. Positives: Price, location, friendly staff, free wi-fi, good coffee and decent continental breakfast. Negatives: so-so mattress, noisy nightlife (in the adjacent rooms - very thin walls, I could hear everything in neighboring rooms). I had to ask how to turn on the heat in the room. The TV had a selection of channels, but was missing the one I wanted to watch. (No guide to speak of)."
Americas Best Value Inn,AC wouldn't work - had to push to get a room change. It was 109* outside and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms.
Americas Best Value Inn,"I was booked paid in full for a room that was not available what so ever, staff threw me out. Was promised a partial reimbursement, and received a penny. Terrible experience"
Americas Best Value Inn,"I stay here because I like the location. It's walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants, as well as the college campus. I've stayed before and it was decent, but this time it looked like blue toothpaste was left in the sink and on sink counter, so I don't think the bathroom was cleaned before we arrived."
Americas Best Value Inn,"I reserved two rooms, one for my handicap sister and one for my husband and myself. We first check into my sisters room which was down in a dingy dark hallway and in the room the windows hardware would not work so the windows were stuck open, and the screens were bent, this was on the ground floor with an ally outside. It is astonishing that the hotel would rent a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women. Definitely not a safe place plus it is is the bad park of town.nohing"
Americas Best Value Inn,Old building. Very noisy. Needs to be rebuilt. You can't expect a 40 year old building to last forever.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Sadly the hotel needs several repairs, our bathroom had two large holes in the wall where the tissue holder was and a vent. The bathroom floor was severally cracked. The neighbors next door had a huge shouting match early in the morning and due to the fact that the walls are so thin, we heard every word and were awakened."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Carpet in room was filthy! Television was 20 years old and only had 10 chanels. Fruit at breakfast was bruised, old, and inedible."
Americas Best Value Inn,This is a standard traveler motel. Reasonably clean and comfortable for the price. The air conditioning was not working but it was promptly fixed and working when I returned. Great location in downtown. I would not hesitate to stay again.
Americas Best Value Inn,"Seems less crowded than nearby motels. Nothing fancy but the rooms have what you need: fridge, microwave, coffee maker. Definitely stay out of the smoking rooms unless you're a smoker. The smoke has thoroughly permeated everything in the rooms."
Americas Best Value Inn,"Rooms was old, carpets stained, room smelled like rotten milk, just gross, didn't wanna walk barefoot."
Americas Best Value Inn,"it was the worse place i have ever stayed at. The service was awful, I know everyone has a bad day, but when youwork with the public like that you should know when to be professional. The breakfast, there wasn't one."
Americas Best Value Inn,"TV was fuzzy, shower was messed up, sink didn't drain properly, hotel was half painted, room was in poor condition"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"No respetaron mi reservación, la habitacion en malas condiciones. Me dieron un cuarto de 1 cama y yo reserve de 2. NO LO RECOMIENDO"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"El olor es desagradable desde que entras a la habitaciónReservas para 3 personas y te dejan 2 toallas solamente y no tienen para darte cuando les pides. El tamaño de las toallas son para secarte las manos y no para un cuerpo.La tina de baño se ve sucia. Tienen que usar quimicos para quitar el zarro, sobre todo si si ya tomo un color diferente al blanco."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Al ver el nombre, Fiesta Inn, pensé que era de la cadena, pero no se como lograron utilizar ese nombre, las habitaciones esta horribles, parecen cuartos de hotel abandonado o casa de seguridad, huelen a cantina barata, y los muebles y paredes están viejos y desgastados y sucios. De hecho preferí no quedarme y perder mi dinero. No se dejen engañar, las fotos en internet nada que ver.Suerte"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Rentamos dos habitaciones y ambas estaban muy descuidadas huelen a humedad,los muebles están ya muy viejos, se están deshaciendo al igual que las paredes de madera. Tienen gatos de mascotas y se andan paseando por todos los pasillos del hotel incluso el área de la alberca.En general no es un lugar para disfrutar tu estancia."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The furniture in the room was old and dirty. The hair dryer on the bathroom was so dusty I hardly was able to use it. There was one day that they didn´t clean the room. The courtesy breakfast was awful. The morning staff in the hotel was kind of rude. I was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here again.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Muy malas condiciones del hotel,las camas quebradas.el refrigerador en malas condiciones y sucio. En sí toda la abitacion en mala condiciones"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Agradable, económico y con todos los servicios. Solo que en la cocineta había tecuejos (cucarachas pequeñitas) por lo que les recomendaría que fumigaran."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We tried to cancel our stay due to the room being so nasty! There were bus all over the bathroom, no sheets on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over! The lock to close the door didn't work so the door is basically open while you are sleeping and the neighborhood is terrible! That asked us for our car info at the front desk in case something happens to it! Everything was super nasty! Yes cheap, but not worth it because we had to pay for another hotel last minute anyway! STAY AWAY!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Las instalaciones están bastante viejas, sucias, las camas en mal estado, pedí habitación para no fumadores y me dieron una en donde todo estaba impregnado de un desagradable olor a tabaco añejo. (Argumentaron que ya no había más habitaciones).Por favor, no caigan en su publicidad engañosa."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Si pides mi opinión te aconsejo que te quedes en otro hotel.

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The conditions off my room was terrible a broken bed, the tv didn't have a remote control , old furniture"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Se requiere mantenimiento a los cuartos, una cama no estaba en buenas condiciones, la cortina de la recámara estaba caída, se reportó y no la arreglaron, los gabinetes de la cocineta no estaban bien, se requiere fumigación y se necesita que el personal de recepción hable español, pues son muchos los viajeros mexicanos que llegamos a ese hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"En los 3 días q estuvimos solo hicieron limpieza en 1 habitación de las 2 q ocupamos, no había cerraduras, estaban quebradas ,solo había la de la puerta, por lo tanto nos sentimos inseguros, parecía vecindario, pues ahí vivía gente, no eran solo huéspedes, NUNCA hubo desayunos !! y batallamos para q siquiera nos dieran toallas limpias de la habitación q NUNCA limpiaron, según dijeron el 3 piso lo asean solo 1 vez a la semana, el servicio malo, al principio nos dijeron q solo teníamos reservación de una habitación y no era de 2 camas como la necesitábamos, las habitaciones olían en exageración a tabaco, solo la ubicación del hotel era buena, pero en general DESASTROSO, NO VUELVO !!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Ha sifdo probablemente la peor experiencia de hotel en mi vida…, un hotel no sólo con las peores condiciones de higiene y limpieza, sino además con un pésimo mantenimiento"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,agradable y económica. Sugiero que se fumigue la suite.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"En muy malas condiciones, muy sucio, con pequeños insectos que me obligaron a irme a primera hora de la mañana siguiente y perder una noche porque ya estaban pagadas dos y únicamente estuve una."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,If it was really cold the heater is in LR by the front door. Would have to prop door of BR open for heat to reach that area. Asked 2 times for washcloth the second time at front desk. Didn't know what it was just gave me towels. They where so rough it good for scratching the back.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"DEPRIENTE , MALTRATADO, PUERTAS ROTAS, ALFOMBRA QUEMADA ETC.ETC....... BAÑO SI BASURERO"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Pague tres días de estancia y no ocupe la habitación por que esta sucio, huele mal, todo esta viejo y roto"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Hotel a 20 min fuera de la ciudad en carro, es viejo, sucio, en pésimas condiciones, tiene cucarachas andando por todo el cuarto, colchas sucias, cortinas, sillón y sabanas quemadas de cigarro, los cuartos huelen a cigarro, humedad y mugre no es opción para hospedarse pues es imposible dormir en esas condiciones ademas de que gastas mas en taxi para llegar a la ciudad. al rededor del hotel solo hay Walmart y restaurantes de comida que debes de caminar como 15 min para llegar a ellos. La alberca es un chapoteadero.Cero recomendable."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Es la verdad muy sucio y en pocas palabras pésimo hotel
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Imposible quedarse en un hotel de paso y con historial de inseguridad por crímenes ahí cometidos etc etc. Estoy en proceso de que Expedía me rembolse. Es una vergüenza para Expedía tener como opción este terrible hotel. Nos causó muchos gastos extras y contratiempos
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Yo reserve 1 hab para 4 personas y 1 para 3 personas obvio con 2 camas matrimonio y llegamos y los cuartos solo eran de 1 cama de matrimonio tuvimos q pagar 20 dlls mas x cada habitación, no había toallas, no hubo desayuno continental. Total un fraude"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"muy deteriorado, sin mantenimiento, de hecho estaban en reparaciones, pero necesita una remodelación total."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Hotellet är beläget i Little Rocks ""high crime zone"".Sönderplockade bilar på parkeringen och hemlösa på andra sidan gatan.Skicket på hotellet är under all kritik.Såg trevligt ut på bilderna men de måste vara väldigt gamla.Skulle inte rekommendera någon att bo här."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"NO RESPETARON MI RESERVACION A PESAR DE ESTAR PAGADA. SOLO CONTRATE PARA LLEGAR A DORMIR. LLEGO Y NO HABÍA HABITACIONES, ME IMPROVISARON UNA HORRIBLE CON UNA SOLA CAMA Y UN ASQUEROSO SOFA, ERAMOS 4. TUVIERON QUE DEVOLVERME EFVO. MUY MAL SERVICIO, PESIMA EXPERIENCIA. NUNCA MAS REGRESO."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Lo contrate una habitación con doble cama con desayuno a la hora de llegar nunca me respetaron la doble cama que ellos no manejaban dos camas ni mucho menos desayuno instalaciones sucias animales por doquier cucharas una televisión del año del caldo la cocineta toda oxidada quise poner a cargar mis te y no servían los contactos pésimo nada recomendable
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Horrible, la peor experiencia, no debería ni salir este hotel anunciado en la pagina..."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Bien por el costo. El cuarto muy comodo, la limpieza no es muy buena. Volvería."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"excelente servicio por parte de la administracion, todos fueron muy amables, la tarifa del hotel que consegui en expedia fue bastante economico y la relacion del valor con el precio estuvo de acuerdo, no esperaba mucho de las instalaciones, estan bien, las habitaciones estan limpias y el area de la alberca esta cuidada pero el hotel en general se ve que tiene sus años, el desayuno continental esta muy pobre y lleven sus toallas porque las de ahi estan muy pequeñas y parecen lijas :)"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,uma porcaria. hotel sujo e fedido. teias de aranha no quarto. péssimo. Não recomendo.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,El peor hotel que he visto e mi vida las habitaciones asquerosas con muchas cucarachas los muebles sucios cuartos destruidos otros cuartos con 20 tipos allí hospedados un asco lo peor no se como hotel.com tiene un hotel como ese en sus listas de hoteles que ofrecen
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No deberían tener este hotel en su portal un hotel caro para los servicios q presta. El edificio se esta cayendo además es sucio y las habitaciones no cuentan ni siquiera con papel higiénico
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Instalaciones muy viejas y deterioradas. Olía muy feo.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"una pesadilla en la primer noche de las que teníamos planeado a las 4 de la mañana nos levantaron a golpes en la puerta, eran los bomberos que teníamos que desalojar de inmediato por un incendió en el hotel, toda una pesadilla para mis hijos, súper sucio la habitación olía súper mal, no hicieron el aseo, etc. nunca volvería a ese lugar!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Mala e irrepetible
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Do not book at this Hotel! The hotel is dirty, run down, and falling apart! The pictures on line do not look anything like the rooms once you get there! The lock On our room did not even work right! We did not stay at all! We went to the Travel Lodge AT&T Center instead and had a wonderful stay!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Habitación muy sucia, con cucarachas, tina de baño manchada, huelen mal en general el cuarto. En recepción no hablan español, lo que dificulta las quejas para latino que no habla Ingles."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Me figuré que era algo mejor. Muy sucio el hotel. Lastimosamente uno online no se da cuenta de muchas cosas sobre la higiene del lugar y otras cosas...
Fiesta Inn and Suites,i had a great rest In a very clean and friendly place customer service was very helpful and would stay here again
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Its was horrible I will never go back. The day we left I paid for another night we ended up getting into a argument with them and they would not refund my money
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk...gave us 2 keys and asked us to go check rooms and see if we liked them!! WHAT!! okay, so we go and check the rooms!!! I was literally scared to even walk in the rooms! We saw 9 rooms total and ended up leaving anyway!! Roaches, ugly stench, OLD and HORRIBLE furniture, did i mention....ROACHES!!! Why is this hotel even on this page..arent they supposed to get audited or something. It was HORRIBLE!! I was there for approximately 15 min and it was the worst experience of my life!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Front desk dirty overall bad
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The worst hotel in my life..Horrible..The staff is friendly but the rooms are dirty, the bath dirty, kitchen is too old.Very small room, the housekeeper never clean our room, no towels, no bathroom paper towel.Was a very bad experience."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Had an awful experience. Rooms were not clean,floors were filthy, cockroaches in the room, no bath towels provided and even found bed bugs on our night clothing."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Bugs broken tiles broken tub missing towels missing light bulbs broken door
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Ive stayed in several small hotels but this one is the worst I should have listen to the negative reviews but I dint think it would be that bad. Live roachess on the wall bathroom was dirty, bed sheets dirty big holes on the conferter.old Tvs with to much color hey but the ac was great. This hotel is like the noise all around vehicles up and down. WOW .Anyway it seems they really dint care. stop having them on youre web site."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I pulled in at 1 am with two small children just wanting a bed to sleep in. This hotel was so gross, roach infested, dark,and quite scary. The hotel clerk knew the hotel was bad and asked me to view the rooms before I decided to stay. I viewed two rooms. And both looked horrific. Needless to say we did not stay at this hotel and I had to search for another one in the middle of the night. And I was not the only customer in there at that time viewing rooms and deciding not to stay. Do not stay at this hotel. It needs to be condemned!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Horrible and Scary!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"very dirty, old and run down. bathroom was very bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,We arrived late and all we saw on property was open doors full of people with tattoos and pants hanging down but we overlooked this fact. As I was getting my room key and went to check it.came the shock-honestly I dont know how its even aloud to keep this hotel running...or how expedia represent this kinda facility1. brown and red stains on walls and doors2.hair on the sheets3.burn marks/holes on sheets4.stains on sheets5.smell like cat litter6. and the top of it was death ticks and bugs under mattressthey showed me 4 rooms and all the same resultsNASTY
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Muy mal la habitaci��n estuvo en p��simas condiciones las almohadas ten��an cabellos al igual que las s��banas no tuve que pedir toallas y jabones pues no quisimos ba��arnos por lo sucio que estaba todo los pasillos y escaleras bajaban y sub��an algunas personas de muy mal aspecto en general me gustar��a que hoteles.com no lo pusiera en su cat��logo de hoteles porque en las fotos aparecen cosas muy diferentes a la realidad
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The motel is very old and run down. Holes in the walls, towel rack and TV bracket ripped out of the walls. It appeared to be a motel where people live there, not just stay overnight. I am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors. I will not stay there again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Rude and angry staff could not figure out how to use the computer.  He kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not have printouts from Expedia to prove we had a reservation.  I called help desk and then the clerk yelled at him for 5 minutes.  Then Expedia explained that they could not help me get a new hotel room until the clerk agreed to refund Expedia.  So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Clean and comfortable, and really a nice, caring staff, especially Punkjabi (spelling unsure of)"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room was nasty and smelly! I requested one queen bed and got two twins. nasty parking lot as well as a messy lobby!!!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Very filty and was stinking like there was a water damage and the house keepers dont clean the rooms. This hotel uses cheap toilet tissue and it leaves crumbs of tissue inside you. Make sure you take your own tissues towels because towels are like rags. The room size and setting is nice, but needs to be clean and maintain."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The first room they gave us was where old pimps go to die.It was in bad shape, couch was torn and dirty refrigerator looked like something died in it carpet was sticky and the room just smelled dirty.I told the lady at the desk that was not the room we were shown on the web site she was very nice about it and put us in a way nicer room that smelled clean and looked a lot better. The pool was refreshing and clean. After they put us in a better room we had nothing to complain about they did a great job fixing my only problem."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Don't stay here ! Checked in and 15 min later was on the phone looking for a decent hotel, an hour later I checked out. .The sign they had at the front desk said .....No Refunds... found out really fast why !!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was looking for a cheap hotel just for the night and came across this one thinking it wouldn't be that bad. Wrong! It's crackhead central. I worried that I was gonna end up getting hurt or that my car would be broken into. I've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one takes the cake. It was downright scary.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Unsafe, the complex is low income housing and the room is good only for death."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Roaches. The most uncomfortable beds you can think of. Nasty bathroom. Towels were more like wash rags. Nasty place overall. Can't beat that price though.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When I checked in I was given a key and asked to check room. I went and it smelled like gas from the stove. Went back got a key for another room this room had a used towel on the chair, bed was not made and shower was filthy. Went back again given a key to yet a third room and this room bed was not made again, no towels, ac was not working and looked like someone was partying in the room with drugs. I then called a,looked for another room nearby and left and received a refund."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Agradable, econ��mico y con todos los servicios. Solo que en la cocineta hab��a tecuejos (cucarachas peque��itas) por lo que les recomendar��a que fumigaran."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Bathrooms were filthy. Door did not shut correctly. No security - car was broken to.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The room in a very bad condition. The kitchenette had all cabinets destroyed and the refrigerator did not have a part!!!. The sofa was ripped and the TV remote control did not work. Only two towels and no trash can at all. Only half toilet paper. No hand or bath towel. The bat tub was very slippery. In general, the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk.."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,no good at all
Fiesta Inn and Suites,booked a 2 bed. got a single bed. room was complete garbage. not at all up to any code whatsoever. refused to shower in the shower. bed felt disgusting. luckily i was only there to sleep late at night and leave in the morning because this place is horrible.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"horrible nothing but drug dealers,pimp and hookers. besides that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,check in was a pain tv broke replaced in about 2 hours a few roaches in room and lots of nats couch bed had no bedding pool was clean bathroom is in bedroom neither has lock on door room had mini fridge sink and microwave no stove they let u see room before u check in
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The customer service is horrible, the staff is very rude and they lack customer service skills. The rooms looked decent online but once you enter the actual room it is a whole different experience. The room smelled of mildew, the stove, fridge, and shower were broken. The furniture is very old fashioned, the couch showed wear and tear, and the bed was very squeaky. I was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but I cut my stay short because I could not stand staying in this hotel any longer."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst hotel I've stayed at. The toilet paper was stained and only wires were sticking out where the fire alarm should have been.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Im 6yr and I had a great time staying there
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Cockroaches everywhere !!!!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst place I have ever been. That hotel should be demolished!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"You only receive 1 towel for your entire stay. Lucky they had an extra for a third person. Housekeeping is once a week. You have to update your key card everyday, sometimes more than once a day. Guests are responsible for emptying their own trash. This is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time. Barricaded the door the first night."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First of all, the front desk had a very unkept, shady atmosphere about it. I could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. The first room they offered me was one in which the front door did not bolt shut. The second room, bolted shut, but I was still leary since I could see the drill marks where this door had been repaired several times. The springs were shot in both beds, and they were not Queen Size as advertised. I saw a couple of roaches crawling in my kitchen. This hotel should not be listed in Expedia. It is a safety and health risk. The WiFi did not work."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"everything was so clean and they also have all the ""extras"" one needs when we pack in a hurry and forget knick knacks....the front desk clerk was courteous and friendly!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the only problem we had was ..when my granddaughter and I returned from an evening out, the kitchen counter was full of ROACHES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ugh!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This is by far the worse hotel I have ever seen. And I have stayed in hotels in Odessa, Texas and Rock Springs, Wyoming. It was such a bad hotel I left and found a Holiday Inn Express that I knew I would enjoy staying in."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The bedroom blanket felt greasy, room smelled like stagnant water was left for a while. Door lock looked their was forced entry, room wasn't swept, no toilet paper. Room looked nothing like it did on the advertisement, not even close."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room was decent with stove, fridge, and microwave. Bed was ok. For the price, i guess i can't complain too much. Overall, not a hotel that I will return to."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Arrived at 9:00 pm no towels door hinge screws were loose making it difficult to shut door cable was not working roach infested big advertisement of Continental Breakfast but in the morning no sign of any breakfast went to front desk again for towels they still didn't have available front desk receptionist more interested on visiting with friends that were at her work.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Booked travel pkg through Expedia, never again!. Would have left immediately, but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed in 3 nights smelled BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower head Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs! springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Bad hotel. I had no problems like the reveiws but the lady at front refused to give me the type of room I booked. Instead she gave a smaller cheaper room and was trying to get me to argue with her but I didn't. She seemed disappointed that I wouldn't argue and I think she just wanted to screw me out of my money that I had already paid. Also didn't get my wake up call she was to busy having a social hours with her friends in lobby
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When i saw the name Fiesta Inn o though that it Will be the famous hotel chain Of Fiesta Inn, but surprise, ugly hotel, noise, people fighting, smoking, vomit in the pool for 3 days nobody cleaned, gang type guys arround and The wifi never worked. I will never stay there again, Is not The fiesta Inn its something with The same name."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When we first saw our suite, we were not happy with the condition of the bathroom,the refrigerator, stove or mircowave! After I complained about the bathroom, it was cleaned immediately, that pleased us. I didn't mention the other things wrong(dirty)because we were not going to use them.The daily making the beds,cleaning the bathroom was done well.The staff was helpful,friendly in other words they are wonderful! I would stay there again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"it smelled very ugly, the room had extra fuirture like they were keeping it like a storage. Paint on the walls didn't match. The was not very comfortable at all. I will never pick this motel again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It wasn't like its post it on the website, its an old motel don't recommend it to no one"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Not that nice, asked for a non smoking and had to put some odor killers , the hall stinks , kind of old and need remodeling well i think i get what i paid for; next time ill spend few more bucks and sleep better."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Lo unico que nos gusto fue la alberca, todo lo demas en muy malas condiciones."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When we first checked in the receptionist was very rude, not only to us but others that were walking in. Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap. I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm. When we returned the bed was still broke. I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night. He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price. This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area. Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa. Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries. Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Plus my parents had a room there also and had roaches in their room, DISGUSTING!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Please don't stay here !!!! It is deceiving from the looks on the outside, the lobby and how the staff is. Once you step in the room you realize the illusion. OMG ! It was awful ! There are and never have been any renovations going on. The mattresses and sofa should have been on dump 20 years ago ! Pay 10 or 20 dollars more so you can feel good and sleep cause here it will have ypur skin crawling and staying up all night !"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Dirty, roaches, hole in wall, ripped bed, overflowing trash. Felt unsafe. Chose to sleep in car in a supermarket parking lot until we found another hotel. It was that bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"That was the worst nightmare in my life,roaches, dirts I even took pictures ,that was hell ,they make you sign a paper that they re not responsible for any lost belonging in your room , people trashy smoking by your window ,wifi doesn't work .i never recommend no one to stay there ,I was supposed to stay for 7 days ,I checked in at 11 pm and I checked out at Midnight and they kept my money"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the hotel lacks a lot of service.. no continental breakfast, no wifi, no housekeeping,"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The bedroom blanket felt greasy, room smelled like stagnant water was left for a while. Door lock looked their was forced entry, room wasn't swept, no toilet paper. Room looked nothing like it did on the advertisement, not even close."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Waste of time
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel does not deserve to be included in the Expedia hotel catalogue, it is a night mare, reservation were not done even than expedia fax where there, dirty and old rooms, feces in the parking lot , bed witout linning and pillow, the ones that have pillows there were staiins on it, there was a heavy odor of smoking of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Well, we didn't spend the day at the hotel. It was not in our plan. But at least we should enjoy sleeping. But, no, the state of the room did not allow that, with that kind of maintenance. It seems to be a guest house but not a hotel. We were not advised. That was the problemAnyway, we had to stick with it, it was secondary."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel overall rating is great. For the price, I could not ask for more. I do recommend it and of course will stay again if I ever need to. Pool looked great unfortunately did not get to use it, other users seem to enjoy themselves greatly. I only wish that the breakfast was served at a later time, It was served too early for me to enjoy. Maybe next time. Thank you."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No lo recomiendo. Insectos en las sabanas. La limpieza general de la habitacion dejaba mucho que desear. El desayuno incluido un desastre
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I booked a and room for my son's girlfriend who came in from out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me to another room, it was about the same. I would never stay here again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place sucks. Roaches,  broken beds , lights night working."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The hotel over booked to begin with. We had a suite with a fridge that only the freezer worked. Had a stove and over and no pans. A sink with no soap. Only got two towels no toilet paper. A baby crying all night. The beds were really old and worn. The dryers there took my money. The pictures on there are nothing what the hotel looks like. For the rate a paid I should have paid a little more for something a little nicer. Never going back to this hotel!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The office staff was incredible. The housekeepers are fast and clean. I enjoyed my stay.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The Fiesta Inn and Suites is not an INN nor SUITE. I will never ever stay in this place again! I walked up the stairs noticed alot of water on the ground & saw a leaking ice maker. Even though it was marked off it clearly has been an issue for some time due to waterstains around the ice maker. Finally got into room & noticed stained carpet & lack of lighting (one light bulb out & no lights in back area of room). The table & chairs appeared they were from a garage sale. We were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down. My wife had to go to the restroom & saw a cockaroach in the sink when she turned on the bathroom light. She did not tell me till the next morning (I had already fallen asleep). So after I woke up, I had to go to the restroom & turned on the light upon entering noticed a couple of cockaroaches around the sink area. After discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower & get ready for the day but lo & behold no bath towels. I go to Front Desk & informed that there are NO BATH TOWELS UNTIL 10AM WHEN HOUSEKEEPING ARRIVES. I was like are you serious? Front Desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no offer to reduce cost of room nor provide credit in any way. There was no way we were staying any longer so we gathered our stuff & left the property. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND TO HOTELS.COM TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR DATABASE."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Roaches, shower didn't work, used toilet paper roll, pillows way past expiration lol would never recommend this place Doesn't even deserve a star"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,We checked in at 8:00pm and when we got on the room we were shocked at the conditions . Door was broken and in poor repair the furniture had cigaret burns all over the pillows and covers were dirty and the straw that broke the camels back was the body hair under the covers . We checked out an hour later and drove 250 miles back home. Never again will I book there.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This hotel was uful could not sleep there where thousands of coucoraches and very sacary people never will stay again
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Unclean, no air conditioning, dirty bathroom, roaches, water on floor in kitchen. Staff could care less about renters. Unsafe area."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This was the most disgusting place I have ever walked into in my life. It looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub. The room reeked like old smoke. So thick you couldn't breathe. The kitchen was filthy. The walls were yellow and sticky from smoke. I was afraid to sit down in the place. I walked in and left 5 minutes later. We did not stay there! I will be requesting a refund as we had to find another hotel. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Ever!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The staff where very friendly but the place was horrible. We asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell right away no one abides by the rules. The room reeked of cigarettes and the bed, couch, and refrigerator where stained and in wore out conditions. If you are looking for a really expensive hotel and it is you last option than maybe this is your place but even for the price I expected better."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place is horrible! I took pics of roaches, blood on the wall, soiled sheets, and soiled chairs! They had no washcloths and only 2 towels! There were hookers and crack heads staying there and wandering in the parking lot. When I cancelled my other 2 nights they didn't even ask why! Plus they did not refund me the correct amount! And the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it! All the pics are not accurate that they have on the site."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room was nasty and smelly! I requested one queen bed and got two twins. nasty parking lot as well as a messy lobby!!!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,terrible for longer than a 1 night stay - ripped bedding - very dirty - eewwww - the only thing nice to say is it is very roomy -
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"For $35.00 a night I was happy, even has a pool."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the most filthy, cigarette smelling, mud tracks on the floor, roaches crawled on me in two minutes of laying down, on what seemed like a cardboard box for a mattress, no towels, toilet was poop smeared, only stayed twenty minutes and had to leave. never ever go to this place. drug den. I booked and pre-paid for three nights, stayed minutes. lost all my money, super baddest of the bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,There are a lot of permanent residence people living at this Motel. There not towels in the room and I basically had to sleep with pistol. I will let you figure the rest out.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This is by far the worse hotel I have ever seen.  And I have stayed in hotels in Odessa, Texas and Rock Springs, Wyoming.  It was such a bad hotel I left and found a Holiday Inn & Express that I knew I would enjoy staying in."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"es la peor experiencia, nada funcionaba, no habia atencion, no dieron la habitacion que reserve, habian cucarachas, no funcionaba el ba��o, todo estaba sucio, es un hotel muy deteriorado"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The ""suites"" are more of a place for people who need to stay for longer than just a tourist's visit and can't afford anything cleanner and in better condition."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I left because I felt unsafe in my room and it was a hotel I would be scared to stay in.  HORRIBLE..I LOST MY MONEY ON THIS ONE. I left and went to another hotel.  horrible
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Did not stay. Slept in car in a Walmart parking lot until we found a hotel the next day. Horrifying experience. Hotel would not even return money for first night even though I was told by clerk I would not be charged. Not a safe place to stay. Please don't be their next victim.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"AWFUL!!!! We didn't even stay, we had to go somewhere else.. Lots of roaches!!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Well, we didn't spend the day at the hotel. It was not in our plan. But at least we should enjoy sleeping. But, no, the state of the room did not allow that, with that kind of maintenance. It seems to be a guest house but not a hotel. We were not advised. That was the problem Anyway, we had to stick with it, it was secondary."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Everything went ok you get what you pay for.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This was the WORST hotel I have ever seen. The outside was full of people just working around. The parking lot was covered with trash and there were stray cats walking around. I knew I would never stay but I went to see my room anyways. The blinds were broken there was NASTY TRASH laying on the and dirty paper towels hanging in different areas of the room. The beds looked like they have not been WASHED in YEARS. It was soo dirty I could not even look at the rest of the room. The smell was out of this world someone should really close them down for good. I went last weekend and to this day ( almost a week later) I cant even close my eyes without seeing the images of that NASTY room. PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND SIGHT."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Dirty, roaches, smells musty. I had to clean entire suite after seeing 4 different suites, before choosing the one I actually remained in. The place needs to torn down or extensive renervation. Stairways are in Bad state of repair, doors have open spaces, filthy for renting."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Rooms weren't ready..... out of the three that i had check myself....they all had something wrong or nasty about them.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,We walked in the room and literally walked back out! So gross and ghetto.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We are satisfied with the overall performance of the hotel personal, we have stayed at thr former Travel Lodge several times and we are happy with the improvements which we witnessed and seen in progress, We would have liked to see more diversity in the breakfast presentation."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"OMG!!! Where do I start. First off let me start by saying DONT WAIST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on tgis place..No im not over exaggerating..Im speaking the honest truth..My suite door look like it had been kicked in before, one of my beds were literally half way on the ground, the rails were broken, my sheets on the other bed hadnt been washed and stains. The fridge look like they found it in the dumpster, the room phone had no buttons to dail out.. So I called the front desk to let them know I cant stay hete with my family.. This arrogant worker that works at night was telling me she had no more rooms available so I went dont to talk with her and explained that Im not gonna pay to sleep here..then all of a sudden she gave me 2 other rooms to look at, they werent any better. When I got back she stated.that.she.called.the manager and offered me a refund. .we end up getting half of.the money refunded and checked.in at Days Inn which I felt it was well worth the money....BUT this hotel couldnt offer me a 10 day stay for free....ITS THAT BAD..NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Arrived at 9:00 pm. Room door hard to close screws coming out. No Towels, front desk said wouldn't be any till morning. Cable didn't work but maintenance did fix and fix door to shut. Room had a bad odor infested by small roaches. Went to get towels in morning weren't ready. Had to escalate issue. No room service while we were out all day."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The front desk was very friendly but the cleanliness of room was horrible. Also , I was only allowed one pillow for two people!! I would never ever stay here again not even for low low price!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This hotel is out dated... nasty holes on the walls... roaches ants and spiders.... I honestly stayed somewhere else... never again...
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Wasn't allowed to check until 4:00 because rooms were not yet clean. Upon checking in, there was a half eaten burrito in the corridor outside my room, the bathroom sink had hair cuttings, paint chips were in the tub, the room had a strong odor, and the sheets were worn thin."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,early check in no available got to hotel at 4pm check like it said online and was told rooms were being cleaned i had to come back after 4 first room was given lock on door wouldnt open next room wasnt a suite like it said online finally i opted to stay in the third room i was showed but it didnt have a stove or a full size fridge it had a mini fridge sink and microwave it was a one bedroom no locks on the bedroom door or bathroom door only one towel and one hand towel in bathroom bathroom is in the bedroom living room sofa bed no sheets pool was nice and clean lots of traffic in hotel outside a few roaches and nats in room but it was ok for the price if your on a budget its ok for a few days dont expect too much from the staff the guy at night doesnt seem to understand english
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This motel's employees are incompetent. They checked me into a motel room only to re-rent it to someone else while I was gone. When I returned to my room the door was wide open and someone had gone through all of my luggage. I called the police, and they showed up in less than a minute because they were already at the property dealing with the same issue with someone else. On site manager didn't want to refund my money, but the police made them. Manage didn't even apologize for what happened and could careless if I was missing any personal items."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel has a lot of potential, but it's so broken down and dirty. The rooms are set up nicely, but it looked as if the room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart. I'm definitely never staying here again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Got a rsvr for a suite..smoke detectors were pulled off the wall in both living room area & bedroom..cigarette burns every where..a whole in the bed in living room ..big gap in entrance door...stove didnt work & maintence couldnt get it to work & cabinet drawers were missing..bad weekend stay..would not recommend to anyone
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"En los 3 d��as q estuvimos solo hicieron limpieza en 1 habitaci��n de las 2 q ocupamos, no hab��a cerraduras, estaban quebradas ,solo hab��a la de la puerta, por lo tanto nos sentimos inseguros, parec��a vecindario, pues ah�� viv��a gente, no eran solo hu��spedes, NUNCA hubo desayunos !! y batallamos para q siquiera nos dieran toallas limpias de la habitaci��n q NUNCA limpiaron, seg��n dijeron el 3 piso lo asean solo 1 vez a la semana, el servicio malo, al principio nos dijeron q solo ten��amos reservaci��n de una habitaci��n y no era de 2 camas como la necesit��bamos, las habitaciones ol��an en exageraci��n a tabaco, solo la ubicaci��n del hotel era buena, pero en general DESASTROSO, NO VUELVO !!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,When looking at pictures online the hotel looks nice but once you get there and get in your room it's two very different places.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The first room I was given had towels that had yellow stains and hair on them and the shower did not work. The mgr put me in another room. The second room was not much better but at least I could shower and the towels were cleaner. I ended up staying on a a friend's couch because I was afraid to see what I would find under the comforter. If this place were inspected there would be a high possibility of it being shut down.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Horrific - From the minute I entered, I was approached by another guest requesting to use my cellphone to call Mexico. I was informed by the front desk clerk that they rent the rooms on daily/weekly or extended long-term, which is her excuse as to why some rooms are cleaner than others. The walkways and stairwells to the rooms were littered with garbage on the ground, and dog feces. Waste cans were overfilled and stockpiled with empty beer cartons and bottles on the floor. Dogs and birds hanging out near the waste receptacles taking advantage of any food waste that was discarded and littered throughout the property."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Do not waste your time! Theres no way aNY living thing could stay here comfortably. Room was dirty smelled overwhelmingly like Raid cigarettes!! No towels, toliet paper or soap. Furniture was falling apart. The girl at the front desk was rude told me I'd be refunded for the days I had booked.. However, I was not."

The place needs to torn down  or extensive renervation. Stairways are in Bad state of repair, doors have open spaces, filthy for renting."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk...gave us 2 keys and asked us to go check rooms and see if we liked them!! WHAT??!! okay, so we go and check the rooms!!! I was literally scared to even walk in the rooms! We saw 9 rooms total and ended up leaving anyway!! Roaches, ugly stench, OLD and HORRIBLE furniture, did i mention....ROACHES!!! Why is this hotel even on this page..arent they supposed to get audited or something. It was HORRIBLE!! I was there for approximately 15 min and it was the worst experience of my life!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First room they had for us .smelled like it had a gas leak. The second room, had bugs everywhere, the desk person didn't try to help the situation at all,"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Water damage on ceiling, bedroom fan light didn't work, pool light laying out on the edge of pool with power cord dangling from it. Just your average outdated one bedroom efficiency apartment complex turned into a crappy motel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Do not recommend this hotel! it was not even up to a 2 star.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"es la 1era noche y fue fatal, la habitacion asquerosamente sucia"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Terrible front desk service, dirty and old rooms, will never style there again!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I booked a and room for my son's girlfriend who came in from out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me to another room, it was about the same. I would never stay here again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel is horrible. It's is dirty, it smells like cigarette when it was a non smoking room. I had to swtich at least three rooms before I actually checked into my own. And the only reason I choose that room was because I was tired of being disappointed by each single one. The lamps had no light bulbs, half of the outlets were not working. There were stains on the sheets pillos and carpet. I did not even want to take my shoes off. The cigarette smell got so penetrated on my clothes it was disgusting. I will never and I mean never stay at this hotel again even if the night was free."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It is an ok hotel, the bedroom is very small, the bathroom and closet combined were about the size of the bedroom. The living room was ok, it had an old television, and the remote did not work, it had a few roaches, though I killed them fast. This place would be great for families if you really need to save money, it had a kitchen which was great, I didn't know this till I checked in."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I didnt stay i called and talked to someone about my getting my money back and he told me they will send me a link so i can get my money back but they have not sent anything.. The hotel was gross.. Drug deals go on there and prostitution goes on there.. Zero stars
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Muy buena atencion gracias
Fiesta Inn and Suites,dirty
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room was decent with stove, fridge, and microwave. Bed was ok. For the price, i guess i can't complain too much. Overall, not a hotel that I will return to."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Un hotel con dos camas c��modas ba��os y todo bien lo ��nico que falto fumigar hab��a cucarachas porque la gente deja alimentos abiertos y ten��a cocineta esta bien para el precio esta excelente
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Called to switch due to the conditions, ur customer service was also dreadful. Non of the rooms match what was advertised on ur website or what was advertised on the check in counter."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Habitaci��n muy sucia, con cucarachas, tina de ba��o manchada, huelen mal en general el cuarto. En recepci��n no hablan espa��ol, lo que dificulta las quejas para latino que no habla Ingles."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was very uncomfortable. Had bugs everywhere.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When we first checked in the receptionist was very rude, not only to us but others that were walking in.  Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap.  I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm.  When we returned the bed was still broke.  I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night.  He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price.  This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area.  Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa.  Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries.  Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.  Plus my parents had a room there also and had roaches in their room, DISGUSTING!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Not a good place to stay at especially if you have children it is not clean and isn't comfortable either
Fiesta Inn and Suites,For the price it was great.The staff was very helpful and accomidating. I reccomend it to any family on a budget!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"From the outside the hotel looks pretty decent. But once u go into the office and u notice the change. The outside seems like the ghetto or projects. Makes u feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I reserved a family room with queen size beds and ended up getting a small room twice as small w 2 twin beds for the same price I wasn't offered a refund of any sort. The management is rude. Then you walk into the rooms, broken beds, non working rusted appliances, tv is nothing but static, the room was not maintained well n to top it off roaches everywhere! We were there for the whole weekend and I asked for extra towels and till today a week later after my trip am still waiting to get my towels. Didn't even bother cleaning the room for us. I can't rate this hotel any lower other wise I would! Stay away ppl worst hotel I've stayed at ever!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I was very pleased with the hotel staff, they were very helpful, friendly and courteous. The happy hour they advertise from 6:30-7:30 was very unorganized and chaotic. My wife and I were there the whole hour and it had not yet started. The continental breakfast was fresh and was set out in plenty of time."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This place was disgusting. I took one step inside the room and decided I could not stay. Nothing was clean. Everything was falling apart. I was afraid of catching an STD from the burnt comforter. The staff was ridiculously rude and the lobby reeked so badly of mold I had to hold my breath. I'm asking for my money back.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was a decent bed for a short notice trip, but I spent as much time away as possible after I killed a few roaches."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,It was worth all 29 bucks. Don't expect too much but definately worth all 29.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I needed a cheap place to stay for 3 nights to attend my son's graduation from basic training. This place satisfied that requirement.Pluses: Close to Lackland AFB (7 mi, 10-15 min during low traffic, 45 min during high traffic). Refrigerator in room. Close to restaurants and grocery store (Walmart Supercenter). There is a pool (I didn't use it) and on Fridays, they have a ""fiesta"" with free nachos and 2 free drinks. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful.Minuses: The elevator was very dirty (I was on the 2nd floor), and it stank when the humidity was high. My room stank when I checked in, but after running the A/C it got tolerable. The mattress was hard, but I can sleep anywhere.Additional info: There seemed to be a lot of families staying there for the same reason as me--cheap and close to base. The parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24/7. I saw kids playing in the pool, people looked happy. I did not feel unsafe, but some people might be scared off by the neighborhood (those used to more high-end places).There are places closer to base, but they were either booked up or more expensive (even the Motel 6 was considerably higher-priced than this place).I would stay here again if my needs were the same (cheap and close to base)."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Bathrooms were filthy.  Door did not shut correctly.  No security - car was broken to.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This is the worst hotel I ever been. It has roaches the carpet nasty the floors the whole room was filthy.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel had a lot of roaches, and everything looked dirty."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The first room I was assigned (#142) had the door broken in and was open. So I asked for a new room, so they gave me RM # 314. The room was very dirty.  The wall, curtains, carpet and bed linens were grossly dirty. The security Chain on the door was gone. There was hair in the bath tube and grime around the tube, toilet and sink. The kitchen was also filthy. There were no hangers in the closet. I asked the front desk for some, but they never arrived. Although I was staying there for 4 nights, there was one towel and no wash rags. No waste basket in the bathroom. NO BODY EVER CAME TO CLEAN THE ROOM OR MAKE THE BED OR CHANGE THE SHEETS. There was music and noise most of the night. I asked the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are. She said No. I asked the Security Guard on nights at the desk how often they get broken into, he said ""Not too many"". Yet I see that room 142 had a new door replaced the day after and that there were multiple new doors throughout the complex.I would never stay there or recommend this place to anyone."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I request a room with 2 beds and got one bed and a pull out couch that the mattress was dirty.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the customer services is unacceptable, very rude, the room full of roaches Ac broke on tx come on I can't beleive they don't have sense of cleanes .I don't have words I stay for 30 mints try to found some help and leave and stay at another hotel. The worst expierence on my life."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Well walked it to room smelling like gas and infested with roaches. Ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like what was advertised online. It was disgusting. I will not stay again
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Check in was easy but arrived after check in time few roaches in room pull out bed doesn't have sheet or blanket and the springs are missing so if u step on the end mattress falls through bedroom bed is very confterable and huge all four of us fit on it if we wanted to all sleep together
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I paid, I arrived, staff was nice,  went to room, door was hanging and would not close properly unless lifted and pushed in, door frame was broken. Inside lock was broken, carpet did not look or smell clean, restroom was acceptable.  Wall had several areas where repairs were made from damage. Bed was not comfortable.  Furniture was old and did not match.I did not stay as I did not feel safe."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Not a good place to stay at especially if you have children it is not clean and isn't comfortable either
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Lo contrate una habitaci��n con doble cama con desayuno a la hora de llegar nunca me respetaron la doble cama que ellos no manejaban dos camas ni mucho menos desayuno instalaciones sucias animales por doquier cucharas una televisi��n del a��o del caldo la cocineta toda oxidada quise poner a cargar mis te y no serv��an los contactos p��simo nada recomendable
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Wouldn't stay here again
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Did not stay,very unclean, smelly, roaches. Sorry but true"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Fatal... no pudimos ni hospedarnos... sucio, lleno de cucarachas...pedimos que nos regresaran el dinero...buscamos otro hotel"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place is not safe.the hotel was not clean,Do not stay here."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel was not my best experience! As soon as you walk into the lobby, there is an unpleasant smell. When you opened the door to your room there was an even worse smell! The control for the tv was missing. I was not able to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO NO ONE!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Don't stay here.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We cancelled as soon as we got there. Very old hotel, musty smell, bedding and rooms were not clean."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,It just gave us where to spend the night. Never again. There was a man sleeping outside on 2nd floor. Some men were outside our room being all loud till 4am. Others were leaning on our car. Check out time was at 11am. At 11:03am they were calling us to leave. We were on our way out. Not even on nice hotels they call to kick us out for a couple of minutes ):
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Dirty room dirty floor no towels and roaches everywhere
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I will never stay here again this is nasty and air dont work just over all ugly
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Las fotografias que se publican no tienen nada que ver con las condiciones del Hotel. Es un hotel muy sucio y viejo. NO RECOMENDABLE.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the rooms where dated, it smelled , one TV did not work , had to get changed , refer needed cleaning, bath fan did not work , but you get what you pay for, staff was very good , property needed help"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,this is the worse hotel i been on my life everything was broken and dirty
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Wish they had breakfast
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"From the outside the hotel looks pretty decent. But once u go into the office and u notice the change. The outside seems like the ghetto or projects.

Fiesta Inn and Suites,Pretty much the worst place I've stayed at. Condition of the place was TERRIBLE
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"i've stayed in some dodgy places, i have no problem with it. but this place made even ME uncomfortable. the sheets were DEFINITELY not clean, there was hair and lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down. during the night as we were going to sleep, my friend swatted a roach off of his arm that appeared to have crawled out of the pillow."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Well the bathroom sink foset was extremely loose, no utensils in the kitchen and no trash can in the kitchen, there was no alarm clock either."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Kind of a dive but for 40 bucks u get what u pay for.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,uma porcaria. hotel sujo e fedido. teias de aranha no quarto. p��ssimo. N��o recomendo.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,uma porcaria. hotel sujo e fedido. teias de aranha no quarto. p��ssimo. N��o recomendo.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It's filthy and needs a lot of TLC! Mold and mattress with wires sticking out!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Me figur�� que era algo mejor. Muy sucio el hotel. Lastimosamente uno online no se da cuenta de muchas cosas sobre la higiene del lugar y otras cosas...
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Room was kind of smelly odor and the bath had old style shower head paint was coming of wall and their was roaches
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Has a bad cigarette smell to it, cabinets dont even have doors, oven didnt work, fridge was disguisting. Room service failed to clean the room, neighbors are very loud to all hrs of the night. Its more like cheap housing appartments than a hotel, ppl actually like there (from the looks of it) and its a very small room, bed are full size not queen size, even though you booked queen size beds. I dont recommend this hotel to anyone."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Dirty, roaches, hole in wall, ripped bed, overflowing trash. Felt unsafe. Chose to sleep in car in a supermarket parking lot until we found another hotel. It was that bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Friendly employeesgreat price for the roomneeds upgrades all overit was perfect for my needs at the timeyou get what you pay formight want to bring your own sheets
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Filthy kitchen, filthy fridge, filthy oven, filthy living room, lumpy uneven beds, only one towel for a room with four guests and two beds, no continental breakfast (despite the sign outside saying so,) no batteries in the TV remote, no mat to wipe your feet save for a shredded up towel that was soaked through by the rain anyway. Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in. To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank. Meanwhile, never book this hotel. Any of you. Whole place should be closed down and sold to somebody who knows how to run a business."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"You definitely get what you pay for. There were stains all over the floor, the bathroom was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time. There was one towel in the bathroom and it was paper thin - I'm so glad we brought our own. The TV didn't work at all, and in the living room there were cables on the wall where a TV should be. The door wouldn't close unless you channeled your inner Hulk and slam it as hard as you can. The people in the room above us had a very impressive stereo system - we could hear them blasting music all night long. Kids are running around everywhere and there's shouting at night. So if sleeping at night really isn't your thing, this is the place for you. Then there's the roaches. They are everywhere, so if you're afraid of bugs (like me!) avoid this place. Ew. Gross."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,i brought my dog to the hotel and on the website for expedia it says pets accepted but there never said there was a fee. they let my dog stay for free. they were really nice there.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First of all it smelled and there were big piles of trash on every floor, then no elevator walked up to third floor which showed empty rooms with trashed furniture in it.... Dumpster had old p## stained mattresses dingy and dirty towels broken cabinets... But like they say You get what u pay for!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel was very run down, there were no towels in the room when we arrived and after requesting towels it took them almost 1 hour to bring them. Their response was they had no clean ones left and had to wash and dry before bringing. The floors/carpet were very dirty. The kitchenette was very old and moldy, plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool. I would not stay here again. And not easy to locate of the 410 loop, if you miss the exit that is more than a mile before the hotel you will end up traveling more than 5 miles round-about to get back. Very weirdly located. I think this was an old apartment complex and was made into a hotel/motel that needs alot of improvements inside and outside. The pictures that were used to describe the hotel must have been from another hotel, they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website. BEWARE"

Fiesta Inn and Suites,The hotel.com reservation said it was a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the kitchenette or the continental breakfast even though the hotel sign still said free continental breakfast. The rooms were clean but out of date and the bed not very comfortable. The outside side walks cigarette butts everywhere and questionable residents. I would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep.

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We picked this hotel as a last resource on a spontaneous trip we took to SA. We saw the low rating but we decided that for one night it really couldn't be that bad. Boy, were we wrong!! When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out. When we finally when to sleep we almost thought there was bedbugs because we saw all these black spots, it turned out to be cigarette droppings. Like really?! The management needs to get their act together and improve the quality of their rooms if they want to continue business in the future."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Pague tres d��as de estancia y no ocupe la habitaci��n por que esta sucio, huele mal, todo esta viejo y roto"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"dirty room, nice location, nice staffs, little bit noisy"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Refrigerator was barley cool. Iron would barley warm up. Phone wouldn't ring. Hair dryer was faulty. No wash cloths - only old, rough towels. No enforcement of pool rules. Spend the extra cash for a better place."

Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst experience in my life. I couldn't believe how dirty it was.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I could not imagine when I reached therethe AC does not work, the carpets were wet and dirty, the toilets were dirtythe bed and bedsheets were dirtythe shower curtains and window curtains looked as if they were there hanging there for centuries Please do not go to his motel everyou will regret your stayI paid 46 dollar but it was not even worthy 4 dollars."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Not as advertised.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"You only receive 1 towel for your entire stay. Lucky they had an extra for a third person. Housekeeping is once a week. You have to update your key card everyday, sometimes more than once a day. Guests are responsible for emptying their own trash. This is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time. Barricaded the door the first night."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"So bad experienced , it was soo dirt and had roches on the bed and all the room"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Es una porqueria de hotel nada queber con las fotos que ponen abia muchas cucarachas y super sucio yo no meqede en esa porqueria de hotel consegui otro mucho mejor nada qeber con esa porqueria

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"An older hotel but clean for what it was. Not much variety for the breakfast but at least it was something. They provided an assortment of cereals, bread for toasting, and make your own waffles. I didnt see any juices but they did have milk that was warm from being left out. A bit noisy if your room is by the pool since it was a gathering place. The front desk person was very nice. The AC in my room didn't work well. Overall, not a bad place to stay if your on a budget and don't mind an older hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room door was not secure (hole on bottom), bed sheets were VERY DIRTY!, bath tub was ALL yellow, cable on television was broken and I will not recommend anybody sorry."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Had an awful experience. Rooms were not clean,floors were filthy, cockroaches in the room, no bath towels provided and even found bed bugs on our night clothing."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"El olor es desagradable desde que entras a la habitaci��nReservas para 3 personas y te dejan 2 toallas solamente y no tienen para darte cuando les pides. El tama��o de las toallas son para secarte las manos y no para un cuerpo.La tina de ba��o se ve sucia. Tienen que usar quimicos para quitar el zarro, sobre todo si si ya tomo un color diferente al blanco."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"walked in the room and smelled gas. the oven pilot was lite with no flames. killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the door. went to the front desk and told them the gas was on and that i killed 4 cockroaches for them but would to turn on the AC so the whole hotel would not blow up. 15 minutes later a man knocked at the door saying he was with pest control, i gladly let him in and stepped outside. He left and an hour later i decided to turn the oven on to fix my dinner, a mouse ran out from under the oven and into a hole near the baseboard of the kitchen. I packed up and called another hotel and checked out within 2 hours upon arrival. the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on my uniform. on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my AC duct. Guess they were not happy with their last place of residence either and decided to travel along with me. Need i say they met with unfortunate disaster which resulted in their death."

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"So dirty and bad hotel, this hotel should not be in Expedia lists."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,the hotel was full of cockroaches. cockroaches were moving everywhere even over the bed. didnot like the stay from any perspective.

Fiesta Inn and Suites,We didn't even stay the night. The room had pretty hair all over it. There was dog feces at the entrance of the lobby and our room for.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This place is more like a Section 8 apartment complex than a hotel. People live here. That means they collect their mail here on a regular basis. It was the worst hotel room and hotel I've ever seen.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It wasn't so bad, but that was just my room. I mean it looked old and the facilities were meh. But I slept comfortably and didn't sweat. I guess it should be priced $30, though. Every time I went into the lobby, someone was complaining about something (one couple said their pillows had no casings (lol, good lord)). But I was expecting the worst, the ladies at the lobby were nice to me, and the location was a short drive from St. Mary's."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"That had to be the worst hotel I've stayed at since the Sahara in Daytona Beach FL, back in high school."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,hotel was not very nice. they only good thing about this was hotel.com was able to help use get our money back and mgrs of hotel was okay with it.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Not good just pay 25-30 more...it's bad..
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Nothing to say!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Don't know why Expedia would recommend this run down hotel, roach infested, bed broken falling down one side, shower stays running lights not working in bathroom.  Zero stars.Luckily they gave me my money back cause I chose not to stay there within 5 minutes of check-in after horrible conditions of rooms."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,we ended up not staying due to it mean under construction the rooms were horrible looking I don't recommend anybody to stay

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"arrive at the hotel and was told that the night was reserved earlier and who was the inernet to check my reservation in my e-mail and had to pay again, still no call to complain to hotels.com. and yet the hotel was awful"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was full of roaches and sheets had cigarette burns,  my front door was made out of wood literally!!!!! Worse ever after seeing the roaches every where I could not stay any longer"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel has a lot of people living there, was told by other chain hotel receptionist it had drug and crime issues and was the worst hotel choice in San Antonio, room I had was very poor quality but had a mini kitchen. Spend a few dollars more a night and go elsewhere, trust me, I cut my losses and left before the evening was over."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"LEFT AND GOT A DIFFERENT ROOM AT THE QUALITY INN. MAY HAVE PAID MORE BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. FIESTA INN NEEDS TO BE CONDEMNED. THEY HAVE BUGS, UNFRIENDLY STAFF, ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THE PARKING LOT, ROACHES, AND DON'T SHOW ALL THE MOTELS POLICIES BEFORE YOU GET THERE. I RESERVED THE ROOM FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE IS PREGNANT AND HAS A 3 YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL. SHE SHOWED UP AT 7:30PM TO CHECK-IN AND THE GUY AT THE COUNTER TELLS HER SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO CHECK IN AT 4PM. SECOND SHE DID NOT HAVE THE CREDIT CARD WITH HER THAT I MADE THE RESERVATION WITH. WHICH THIS ROOM WAS A RESERVE NOW PARTY AT HOTEL OPTION. SO HE WOULD NOT LET HER PAY FOR HER ROOM. SHE CALLS ME AND I CALL FIESTA. TOOK ME AT LEAST 10 MINUTES TO GET THE COUNTER PERSON ON THE PHONE. THE HE ARGUES WITH ME ABOUT ALL THIS AND I TELL HIM THAT NOWHERE ON THIS RESERVATION DOES IT STATE ANY OF THIS THAT HE IS CLAIMING COMPANY POLICY. SO I IN TURN CALL HOTELS. COM. VERY HELPFUL BUT THE WAY. THEY CALLED FIESTA AND THEN MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO CHECK-IN AND USE HER CARD TO PAY. 20 MINUTES LATER SHE IS GETTING A REFUND AND MOVING TO A DIFFERENT HOTEL. ENOUGH SAID. IF YOU ENJOY SLEEPING WITH THE TRASH THEN THIS HOTEL IS FOR YOU. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.THEY NEED TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This place was disgusting. I took one step inside the room and decided I could not stay. Nothing was clean. Everything was falling apart. I was afraid of catching an STD from the burnt comforter. The staff was ridiculously rude and the lobby reeked so badly of mold I had to hold my breath. I'm asking for my money back.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We checked into the hotel and I should have known we were in trouble when the clerk asked me to go look at the room to say it was ok before he checked us in.  The room was small, and shabby, but it was almost midnight and the area that the hotel was in did not look bad, I said OK to the room.  They only gave us one towel, and no washcloth, my husband went to ask for more and they only had one to give us.  The sheets were wrinkled and gray, and I saw a cockroach in the bathtub.  There also were very poor patch jobs done on the walls where someone had knocked a hole in the wall, and the next door neighbor had what sounded liked a big and vicious dog.  On the second night there, we saw 7 cop cars when we got back from our evening activities, and about 1:00 a.m. there was a knock on our door.  We did not answer it and someone knocked again.  This time my husband said ""who is it?"" and there was a bit of a commotion outside the door and no one answered.  I called the front desk and told them what was going on and the person who answered the phone said ""It might have been the SWAT team, there is a bit of a situation going on here, they may want you to evacuate and come to the front office.""  Then he put me on hold and came back to the phone and said ""no you are in a different part of the hotel, just stay put and call me if anyone comes to your door again.""  We later heard what sounded like gun shots, about 5 times.  Then all was quiet.  Needless to say the next morning we checked ou"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room never got cleaned there was roaches, only one towel they gave us and they never changed our sheets would ask for stuff and they said no one was here to get it..Front desk guy was always on the phone..It was just bad wouldn't stay again there at all..."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The place was filthy!!! Had to always go for clean towels!! TV missing off the wall no microwave and just looked totally run down . no breakfast in the morning. I feel Expedia should not even have this in their lists of places so prdtty disappointed with them too!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Imposible quedarse en un hotel de paso y con historial de inseguridad por cr��menes ah�� cometidos etc etc. Estoy en proceso de que Exped��a me rembolse. Es una verg��enza para Exped��a tener como opci��n este terrible hotel. Nos caus�� muchos gastos extras y contratiempos
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Real dump there is nothing to add theplace is not fit to stay in
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel rooms were ok because it had a full size fridge, small stove, microwave, etc. The rooms were very old looking and only had 1 really old TV that was faded. It was cool in the living room but hot in the bedroom since it only had an area AC unit. The water pressure in the shower was a joke...and they kept 3 small towels in stock. We had to ask for extra towels each night. I was really upset when I went to take a shower and all that went down. I did like the swimming area and the employees were pleasant."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Ceiling fan almost caught fire, no towels two days in a row. No coffee pot nothing that they advertise."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,It was very discussing they delayed our check in time because they said they were getting the rooms cleaned. When we finally got to our room the floor was all dirty you could tell they had not cleaned at all there were brown and black stains on our restroom and the room was nothing like the picture My sister also got a room and was delayed her check in time as well when we went to go look at her room it had not been cleaned either the two queen beds were like an inch apart from each other and the beds were more like full size not queen And there were two dirty diapers left on the floor in her room Also when we go to our rooms the cleaning lady was on the second floor gathering sheets from the rooms and throwing them off of the balcony onto the dirty parking lot so she could wash them all while smoking a cigarette going from room to room which were non smoking rooms I would never ever think about staying here a motel 6 is better than this place
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"very dirty, old and run down. bathroom was very bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Esta super llena de cucarachas!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Door broken, spider webs in corners, no toilet paper in restroom went to front desk and they just said..we dont have any. I had to go get some at the gas station. Beds are old loud squeaking when rolling over. Only 5 channels on tv. Definitely will not go back or recommended to anyone!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Absolutely Horrible!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Horrible and nasty . not for humans. i did not stay had to leave. this place needs to be closed
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Stayed there for the first time a month ago, wasn't horrible.Tried another stay, this time I couldn't wait to check out, I would have found another place but I was too tired to even look.There was a heavy odor of mold in the room, my sheets were stained with something that was yellow, brown, and red, cigarette burns on the sheets, no pillow cases on on my pillows or at the front desk. I didn't even use the bathroom because I didn't want to catch any diseases.This place looks nothing like what was advertised on any website.I will not be staying there again no matter how inexpensive the rooms are.Avoid this place as much as possible."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Booked travel  pkg through Expedia, never again!. Would have left immediately, but everywhere else  booked for this event  and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The stay was awful, staff was rude and lazy. They had me go and check the room to see if it was ready and available. The access to my room from the parking was not accommodating. There were roaches crawling around the room. My shower was broken, I had to hold the metal bar in to keep the water running from the shower head. And the room had a nauseating odor. Not staying here again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Las instalaciones est��n bastante viejas, sucias, las camas en mal estado, ped�� habitaci��n para no fumadores y me dieron una en donde todo estaba impregnado de un desagradable olor a tabaco a��ejo. (Argumentaron que ya no hab��a m��s habitaciones).Por favor, no caigan en su publicidad enga��osa."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Bien por el costo. El cuarto muy comodo, la limpieza no es muy buena. Volver��a."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"terrible, police came twice during the night due to disturbances on it. It is very bad place to stay, too dirty, and evrything is rootten. Additionally they charge us duoble of its regular price due to the season, it's better to be closed."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The staff is great especially Monique and Jillian. Maintenance is fast and know what they are actually doing. I enjoyed my stay and I always will
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This hotel sucks it stinks like if something died the pictures are not the same as the real thing don't recommend for anyone it was a very bad experience me and my family didn't even stay I recommend the quality Inn down the street $50 more but way better
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"A mi en lo personal me gusto el trato las habitaciones, no tengo queja alguna"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Lobby was modern, staff was super friendly. However...room was low standard. Fire Alarm was laying on the counter. AC was set at 72 and the suite bedroom was unbearably hot. We set it to 60 and left for 2 hours...still hot but tolerable with the ceiling fan. Not enough towels or wash rags. Loud screaming young kids in the pool until 10;15pm on Thursday night. Room needed updated 5-10 years ago. Breakfast was average. Super staff, though."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"i would have cancelled the reservation but it was non refundable. would have been nice to know that the hotel was under construction with planks to walk on over the second floor. in cases like this, HOTELS.COM should take them off their list rather than subject clients to such conditions."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Terrible false advertising, my husband got attacked with bed bugs,overall bad. Never agaun will I book a hotel online. Refund Please!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"There was a big sign when I checked in saying no refunds, when I saw the room and all the kids playing I know why they put it there. Horrible experience you should not even suggest that hotel its actually an apartment where all the locals who can't rent stay. Absolutely disgusting did not stay, lost my phone and money but was not going back there. Do not suggest this place to someones dog."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room was stinking.The bathroom was in bad state.All of the stuffs are too old.Even the experience with customer care was not good.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Overall I was satisfied with my stay at the Fiesta Inn & Suites because they accomodated me and my dogs at a very fair price. The place is rundown but the rooms are spacious and the AC keeps it cool. Convenient drive to SeaWorld and downtown San Antonio. Lots of restaurants, movies, shopping in the immediate area. Drawbacks: beds are just ok, only got 1 roll of tp and had to ask for more at the front desk (annoying), only got 2 towels and never got more despite asking several times, never made the ""complimentary breakfast"". They had coffee out but I didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free. It was a bit loud Thursday night with people walking back and forth and hanging out at the pool, but surprisingly Fri was quieter. People at this motel tend to hang out outside and were often just outside our door area in a nonthreatening way."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Disapointed at all.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Malas condiciones de cuartos
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Le pongo la ��ltima opci��n ya que no hay menos... cuando la calificaci��n del hotel es nefasta la zona es lo de menos, comet�� la equivocaci��n de pagar desde antes del viaje"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"A big nasty dump didn't stayed, lost my money, will question Expedia next time looking for saving but not that way!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,confortable y tranquila
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Rentamos dos habitaciones y ambas estaban muy descuidadas huelen a humedad,los muebles est��n ya muy viejos, se est��n deshaciendo al igual que las paredes de madera. Tienen gatos de mascotas y se andan paseando por todos los pasillos del hotel incluso el ��rea de la alberca.En general no es un lugar para disfrutar tu estancia."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Yo reserve 1 hab para 4 personas y 1 para 3 personas obvio con 2 camas matrimonio y llegamos y los cuartos solo eran de 1 cama de matrimonio tuvimos q pagar 20 dlls mas x cada habitaci��n, no hab��a toallas, no hubo desayuno continental. Total un fraude"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The staff was friendly. The room had a not pleasant smell. Location was good. The beds were not comfortable. Didn't like the way the sheets looked, dingy didn't appear very clean. It was a place to stay, if you need a cheap place. :)"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Unsafe, the complex is low income housing and the room is good only for death."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"MALISIMO CREO QUE USTEDES DEBERIAN DE QUITAR ESTE MOTEL DE SU LISTA, POR QUE LOS DESPRESTIGIA. MUY MALA LA ATENCION,CUCARACHAS,LAS SABANAS ROTAS Y MANCHADAS, LAS TOALLAS VIEJAS Y PERCUDIDAS, NO LO RECOMIENDO ."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the most filthy, cigarette smelling, mud tracks on the floor, roaches crawled on me in two minutes of laying down, on what seemed like a cardboard box for a mattress, no towels, toilet was poop smeared, only stayed twenty minutes and had to leave. never ever go to this place. drug den. I booked and pre-paid for three nights, stayed minutes. lost all my money, super baddest of the bad."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The stove in the room was not working and the restroom didn't have any toilet paper or trash can. The knobs were so old and rusted they fell off. Other than that my kids enjoyed the stay.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The bed sheets had a bad smell to it and hair was found on the sheets as well. The bathroom was horrifying. Mold in the grout and bad stains in the tub. The overall condition of the hotel was run down and worn out. We even seen cockroaches in the morning crawling on the walls. My experience of this hotel was not a good one at all. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,They didn't respect my reservation although the reservation was totally paid. They said that don't have hot water and the front desk wasn't kind.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The furniture in the room was old and dirty. The hair dryer on the bathroom was so dusty I hardly was able to use it. There was one day that they didn��t clean the room. The courtesy breakfast was awful. The morning staff in the hotel was kind of rude. I was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here again.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"excelente servicio por parte de la administracion, todos fueron muy amables, la tarifa del hotel que consegui en expedia fue bastante economico y la relacion del valor con el precio estuvo de acuerdo, no esperaba mucho de las instalaciones, estan bien, las habitaciones estan limpias y el area de la alberca esta cuidada pero el hotel en general se ve que tiene sus a��os, el desayuno continental esta muy pobre y lleven sus toallas porque las de ahi estan muy peque��as y parecen lijas :)"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Ok place if you are not looking for high class accomodations.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Where do I start the bath room sink drain real slow. False advertisement on the continental breakfast, the room had roaches and other insects. The room didn't have an iron. I had to put a $5.00 deposit to get the iron. I got my money back afterwards. All around I didn't enjoy my stay."

Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It may be cheap but not worth it. Theres is a lot of drug heads, prostitutes, permenant residents. You name it they got it all. Definitely dont take family. My car was broken into in the front of the office in daylight hours. When the police came he said there is a lot of trouble at this motel and dont like to come out there. The manager never even apoligized and was hearing the whole thing. Even their own maintenance room gets broken into all the time. The manager doesnt even try to make it safe anyone can do what ever they want . Oh and their breakfast is a joke you have to make your own waflles one at a time. lol."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This was the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced!! The room was dirty when we checked in. There was no towels in the bathroom and everyday we had to go to check in desk to get towels and have housekeeping clean the room. Thank God we stayed busy with my little brother's Air Force Graduation activities. The sheets we dirty on the bed. It was not even worth the price we paid for it. This hotel should be shut down and demolished!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room never got cleaned there was roaches, only one towel they gave us and they never changed our sheets would ask for stuff and they said no one was here to get it..Front desk guy was always on the phone..It was just bad wouldn't stay again there at all..."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Found old pizza in oven from last tennants... Full of roaches...i had to live with roaches and the stent of smoke in a non smoking room...got my vehicle broken into guys deinking all night noise and no toilet paper ...._at all....
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Never stat at this hotel the staff is horrible and the rooms are outdated with mold on the walls in the bathroom.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Worst experience ever. I booked two nights, I stayed 10 minutes. The walk way up to the room smelled like urine. The room itself smelled disgusting. I saw some things that I'm pretty sure... I guess I'll leave it at that. It's an unsafe place. I felt like I needed to be on high alert. From the beginning I was uncomfortable, unwelcomed. I do not recommend this hotel at all."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Turned around and walked out.  Could not subject my kids as well as myself to those conditions.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel is not in a good area, there are people that live there! It is not clean, the breakfast consist of cereal... and not even real bowls. The coffee was terrible. The room was very small and the air conditioning was in the living area, nd the bedroom area got NO circulation so it was VERY HOT!! I am not tall and myfeet hung off the bed, they were barley bigger than a twinand they considered hem a full.... Overall would NEVER go back again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We still had to pay for the first night but could not stay since the mold smell, the hole thru the bedroom door (from a fist I guess), the bathroom was terrible! The shower curtain rod (those half moon type) was hanging by both screws...barely! So sad to have to pay for that garbage What was portrayed by the hotel on here is false - do NOT stay there!!! The lady in front of me was doing the SAME THINGS!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Omg where do I begin. Holes in the wall, ripped up carpet, wood furniture had holes in it. There was mold on the shower curtain, the shower curtain would not close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of the curtain rod because the rod was not firmly connected to the wall. The water never got hot, very poor water pressure.The towels were stained. Very dimly lit. The staff would sit on their cell phone talking while I was standing there waiting to ask for a wash cloth. I was then told someone would be by in a moment to deliver one. Never came. The door had a wide gap, wide enough to let a cold breeze in."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Very dissatisfied. Too much noise and loud and noisy neighbors. More like an extended stay place. Requested towels were never delivered. Half used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"DISGUSTING! Very dirty, bed bugs, and nothing worked."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I defiantly got what I paid for. For $40 a night I got a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, bathroom and walk in closet. The room was clean but in bad condition. I had to ask for towels and the AC did not work well though it did keep my room slightly comfortable."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The ""suite"" was super small. The ""double"" beds were the size of twin beds (and very uncomfortable). You had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the bathroom. The linens on the bed would not stay on because they used a flat sheet as a fitted. The towels were paper towel thin (and we had to actually ask for them because there was none in the room) The pull out couch was not a pull out. They didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had. But you could ""purchase"" from their cafe. :( It is a very old, run down motel. The pool was nice size, but cloudy and dirty. The receptionist was great though. Would not be my choice of hotel if I come back to the area again.!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Not at all recommended
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Hotel was in horrible conditions.  Living room had no light.  It had no TV.  Carpet and restroom where dirty.  It smell horrible.  Wasn't  even able  spend the night there.  Do not recommend at all
Fiesta Inn and Suites,picture online was deceiving :( the kitchen appliances were in bad condition and the sofa was torn and old.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel stay was very pleasant, and I would stay again. If I had to change one thing, it would be that the bed was just a little harder then I like but that is it."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Unclean, no air conditioning, dirty bathroom, roaches, water on floor in kitchen.  Staff could care less about renters.  Unsafe area."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"DO NOT STAY HERE. It is the worst, most dangerous place I have been. The rooms were filthy and it seems that they must rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out of the place. I did not stay there because I was worried about my safety. I left the room the same day and did not return. The carpet is filthy and sticky, you cannot take off your shoes. The fridge was frosted over with ice and rusted. The toilet paper holder was the back of the toilet. There was no holder, just toilet paper sitting on back of the toilet. There was no phone in the room and after my second time asking for a phone, the person said she had to put in a work order, because people take phones out of the room and they don't know it's gone. It is not a safe place. I was told by a worker that the reason WIFI doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is that someone cut the power lines while trying to steal it. I would have more pictures to upload but my phone died since I spent about an hour on it trying to find a safer place to stay."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Great staff, polite and friendly. Facilities, well, no. Had to move from first room for unwanted insect guests everywhere, second room not much better though it had a great a/c, but other than that and good lot lighting, wouldn't recommend it"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I left. Room was dirty. Bed was very old. Cockroaches in the room.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst place ever!!!!!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Reserved a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids. Smelt of smoke BADLY and was so not clean. 2 towels, no hand towels or wash cloths. Oh and NO toilet paper in the room. Never again!!! Absolutely the WIRST hotel I have ever attempted to stay in."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was ok. Came with a small kitchen which I didn't ask for. More towels would have been nice. It's an older hotel, what can I say. It's ok to sleep and shower and get going."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"DEPRIENTE , MALTRATADO, PUERTAS ROTAS, ALFOMBRA QUEMADA ETC.ETC....... BA��O SI BASURERO"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The only clean things in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Wow, how this place is up and running. A very sad place. This motel has everything a bad motel needs to have to be a horror place to stay. Dirty floors, no bath towels, thugs, nasty tattoo hookers, and verbal fights at 3am. I'm so glad my son stayed with me parents and not to be here for this stay."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Se requiere mantenimiento a los cuartos, una cama no estaba en buenas condiciones, la cortina de la rec��mara estaba ca��da, se report�� y no la arreglaron, los gabinetes de la cocineta no estaban bien, se requiere fumigaci��n y se necesita que el personal de recepci��n hable espa��ol, pues son muchos los viajeros mexicanos que llegamos a ese hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First impression did not sway us to stay. We were given the room key to ""check out the room"" prior to the hotel staff checking us in. If they are not that confident in their room, you should not be either. We walked to the room, opened the door, took 2 steps in, and left. The smell, appearance, and condition of the room, made us turn away. I could not leave the room comfort blank, but we wound up not staying."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst place I have ever been. That hotel should be demolished!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"fillthy broken down hotel ! rented two days, was out the next morning!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The room was like a real life ""Silent Hill"" room....roaches, stains, stench!!!! Only missing the monsters. I didn't even stay, I decided to leave as soon as I lifted the covers from the bed and roaches were all over dead and alive. Too bad, the staff was friendly and the price was cheap, but not worth staying for."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We arrived late, and checked in. The front desk charged us twice when we already paid on here. Then when we got to the room, it was supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke. Faucets were leaking, curtains were falling, and the bed felt like a piece of cardboard. To top it off, we didn't feel safe. No housekeepers on duty either. So we immediately went back to the front desk, and canceled. It was horrible. Do not stay here at all."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When I went into the room I just cried. The beds were dirty had hair, dirt and stains all over. The bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower wasnt clean. The carpet had food, dirt, hair and trash on it. The couch and chair was ripped up and horribly stained. The door looked like it was kicked in. The heater/ac unit wouldn't push heat because it was clogged with food, gunk and kids little toys. The only cleanish area was in the closet. This was the worst hotel I've ever been in. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Was VERY disappointed. The rooms smelled, the carpets were very dirty...walking only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks, left feet or socks BLACK. The rooms are in much need of updating...small, dirty, some roaches moldy bathtubs, afraid to sit on sofa ( had stains that I did not want to guess from), could not sit on floor due to nastiness ...The Continental Breakfast was ONLY cereal, toast,waffles, coffee, milk, OJ. The fronts of cabinets in our suite with kitchenette were falling off. The Expedia description of the suites need to be updated so that others do not go expecting ""fully stocked kitchenette with pots/pans and everything needed"" ... NOT!!!!! That is exactly why we booked two suites there,,,to save money to take grandchildren to SeaWorld. The front Desk told me-show me where it says ""fully stocked"""
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel has a lot of guests: cockroachs, cats, etc."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Terrible hotel. Fridge did not work, tv got one station with no volume. The bottom of the door had a hole in it.The room smelled really bad. We felt really unsafe in this hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"this was one of the worst hotel I've ever checked in to when I got into the room and turn on lights was roaches crawling on the counters! Wires were hanging on the wall as if somebody pull the TV from it, missing  drawers in the kitchen cabinets. Light switches dirty as ulif someone with was working on a car. I have never fault so uncomfortable."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Arrived at 9:00 pm. Room door hard to close screws coming out. No Towels, front desk said wouldn't be any till morning. Cable didn't work but maintenance did fix and fix door to shut. Room had a bad odor infested by small roaches. Went to get towels in morning weren't ready. Had to escalate issue. No room service while we were out all day."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Do not waste your time or money . The place is nothing like the pics. U will be disappointed.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,There was no toilet paper in the room. The air conditioner did not make the bedroom cold. The bed was not made the comforter was only on top of the messy sheets.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Roaches galore!! Springs coming out of the mattress. Cigarette butts on the stove...you could see outside through our door and our AC unit. Tried to get a refund after the first night so we could stay somewhere else the second night but they wouldn't do it. It was the cheapest so I guess you get what you pay for.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I didn't even stay there because it disgusting... No tv in the room. The door looked like it had been kicked open.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,ESTA MUY SUCIO Y LLENO DE TODO TIPO DE ANIMALES NO LO RECOMIENDO ANADIE.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,They had to give me a refund..there where Roches. In the beds..makeup and hair the. Sheets wasnt clean..drug activity..very dirty. They. Should. Be closed down ..the staff. Is very nice. And kind but the hotel. Itself SUCKS
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk. She gave me a key so I can check the room before she can check me in?  I can tell already this is not going to be good. Got to the room it's filthy and bugs are crawling around. It was late I need a place to stay so I have to deal with it.And I will say never again in this motel.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Ive stayed in several small hotels but this one is the worstI should have listen to the negative reviews but I dint think it would be that bad. Live roachess on the wall bathroom was dirty, bed sheets dirty big holes on the conferter.old Tvs with to much color hey but the ac was great.This hotel is like the noise all around vehicles up and down. WOW .Anyway it seems they really dint care. stop having them on youre web site."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Awful experience,  very unclean and unsanitary. Didn't stay."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Very dirty rooms better off somwhere else !
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I pulled in at 1 am with two small children just wanting a bed to sleep in. This hotel was so gross, roach infested, dark,and quite scary. The hotel clerk knew the hotel was bad and asked me to view the rooms before I decided to stay. I viewed two rooms. And both looked horrific. Needless to say we did not stay at this hotel and I had to search for another one in the middle of the night. And I was not the only customer in there at that time viewing rooms and deciding not to stay. Do not stay at this hotel. It needs to be condemned!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff who are highly knowledgeable about San Antonio, the places to see and what to avoid. Having said that all the rest was downhill from the cleanliness especially in the kitchen.I can only imagine this was once a pretty recommendable establishment that maybe got overwhelmed with the amount of units to upkeep daily and with kitchenettes in the units comes the constant need to repair the appliances. In our case none of the kitchen appliances worked (fridge, stove, etc.)The location is reliant on a car if you want to see the sites in the city but there are plenty places to eat in the area if you don't mind walking."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Had holes in the wall and doors, stray animals all over and cat poop all over. Smelled of cat urine all over outside. Elevator looks like a death trap. The balconies are tilted down as if they're sinking and going to collapse. Bed wasn't very comfy and carpets had stains all over. Stay away from this hotel"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place is a dump. Our friends had items stolen out of their car. The room was filthy. The lawn chairs and tables were hazardous to sit in. The walk way on the third floor was uneven and hard to walk on while drunk. The coffee was extremely strong in the office. The one thing that worked well was the A/C, it kept the room nice and cool. I read the reviews before booking and thought it couldn't be that bad. Well, it was. Had it not been for a wedding and the party staying there, I would've gone somewhere else. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This place was an absolute dump. Walls look as if they have never been cleaned. Couch was dust and dirt so thick on it. There was no toilet seat on the toilet. How the heck does that work. I asked for a queen bed and said I had two dogs I made sure they knew. When I get there check in is at 4:00 they tell me I have to wait 30 minutes. What have they been doing all day check out is 11. They say oh we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room. This is where i get the nasty I cleaned room with two single beds and no toilet seat with filth all over it smelled horrible. I left after being in there for less than 30 minutes. I would rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer. I can not believe the filth in that hotel.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The place was in poor condition and dirty.The security lock on the door was broken too. I felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This place is horrible.  There were roaches in the beds and all over the room.  Bedding and sofa had large yellow stains.  There weren't any lightbulbs in the room which means there wasn't any light.  I had to use the flashlight in my phone to see.  I called the office about the light and they said I would have to wait until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man.  The rooms smell really bad.  There were holes in the walls and carpeting.  Bathroom was dirty.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Elevator was broken and I had to carry my luggage to the third floor.  Lock on door didn't work.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Al ver el nombre, Fiesta Inn, pens�� que era de la cadena, pero no se como lograron utilizar ese nombre, las habitaciones esta horribles, parecen cuartos de hotel abandonado o casa de seguridad, huelen a cantina barata, y los muebles y paredes est��n viejos y desgastados y sucios. De hecho prefer�� no quedarme y perder mi dinero. No se dejen enga��ar, las fotos en internet nada que ver.Suerte"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Last minute incident caused us to stay at this local hotel and since it was only going to be for one night and we are locals, I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a room. With that being said, the place was kind of eerie and the room was dirty. Floors were dirty, shower curtain was full of hair and mildew and room over all had a lingering smoke smell (room was non-smoking). We survived the night but I won't be going back to stay there and unfortunately, I can't say I would recommend this place either."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The room was very dirty. Let's start at the door the had big gaps at the top and bottom of the door where you could see outside. There was big hole in the wall that was patched and not painted over so it looked really bad because it was so big. Even though this was a non-smoking unit, all furniture had cigarette burns on them. The room had an odd smell to it. The carpet was very dirty with stains everywhere, I didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes on. The wasn't connected to the wall and the shower was very dirty. To make it worse the universal tv remote didn't work either. I would have asked for a refund if it wasn't to late. I wanted to sleep in my truck. There are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worse hotel of my life NEVER AGAIN they don't even deserve own a hotel worse mistake of my life . lesson learned . I don't not recommend anyone and I do mean ANYONE NOOOOOO DO NOT STAY THERE!!I recommend DAYS INN best service an free awesome great breakfast !!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"i went up to look at the room it smelled, everything was old, dirty, no light in the room, and a miss bulb in the night light. it wasn't what i expected!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The staff was incredibly nice and accomodating however, the hotel was less than pleasant. Only two of the lights worked, there were no trashcans, there was trash underneath of the bed, the bathroom was disgusting, there was a layer of what I'm hoping was just dust covering the entire ceiling, the door did not shut all of the way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience. The staff was great, like I said, and gave me no issues when I checked out early/cancelled the rest of my reservation. I would never stay here again or reccommend to a friend. The photos online were WAY better than the actual hotel itself."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Tyhere where holes in the wall broken closet door and,no towels or soap.Oh sheets where dirty too!!Gross!When I first checked in,I requested a lower floor room,stating I had surgery one week ago.They said I had no choice ,got 83rd floor ,NO ELEVATORS!STAIRS WHERE TRASHY And filthy!!!I WENT TO MY DAUGHTERS AIRFORCE BOOTCAMP,Sore and tired!!!THE MOST HORRIFIC,GROSS ,NIGHTMARISH h"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Extremely disappointed!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I will never stay here again it seemed like a crack motel. The room was out of date the bed not comfortable the shower was broken so u couldn't turn it on with the knob u had to turn it on with some kind of lever they riged up and had very little water pressure. The cleanliness was lacking I lifted the toilet seat and there was hair , the shower had someone else's hair in it I wouldn't even let my little girls walk on the floor without shoes or take a bath I didn't even want to lay in the bed this hotel is GROSS"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Horrible not kid friendly found drugs in drawers. Room looked like they had not cleaned in a while burned sheets ect. Staff very unprofessional.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Definitely nothing like the pictures. We were scared to sleep under the covers and instead slept fully clothed on top of the covers. The fridge had not been serviced in a while and had more ice than freezer room. We had to move and hook up the tv for ourselves. The tub was so worn that the bottom was completely black. It was definitely placed on our list of do not stay at again hotels.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"We were there for our daughters Air Force graduation and we found our room comfortable and clean the staff such as the housekeepers were friendly as was the maintenance guy, the night girl I believe her name was Monique she was just AWESOME ,polite and so helpful with that said the day shift girl was rude, unhelpful and LAZY!!!!!  that was only one of the many rude things she said to us during our 4 day stay!! Other than that would definatley return... super close to everything!! Thanks again night shift girl and other pleasant staff! The Erickson Family"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,check in was a pain tv broke replaced in about 2 hours a few roaches in room and lots of nats couch bed had no bedding pool was clean bathroom is in bedroom neither has lock on door room had mini fridge sink and microwave no stove they let u see room before u check in
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Room was small funiture was torn and worn out and lots of roaches.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,agradable y econ��mica. Sugiero que se fumigue la suite.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Please don't rent a room here!!!!you will be very disappointed.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This motel was dreadful. As soon as we walked in the room we saw a roach on the wall. There were only 2 towels. No washcloths footmats or handtowels and I called but they never brought any more. The toilet still had black filth under the rim. The air conditioner sounded like a lawn mower. The outside walls and doors had to be super thin because I heard several conversations during the night most contained wailing and cussing.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When I arrived everything looked good, upon further inspection I learned that there was no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels. We also noticed there was pot residue on the night stand by the bed."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel was horrible. The room was nasty, we could not take a shower because there was no knob to turn on the water not that I would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway. The floor and tables had burns all over them when I specifically asked for a non-smoking room. There were cats living all around the hotel and drug deals going on right outside our door! I had my two year old son with me, I was terrified I didn't even want to leave until morning because I was scared something would happen to us. This place needs to be shut down! I took pictures of the room I wish there was a way to post them on here so everyone could see the horrible conditions of this hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. My parent room had roaches in it. The beds are so small. The room had a strange odor. The bath room was not very clean. The tub was in terrible shape, it looked dirty, but it was not. I was tempted to shower with my shoes on. The shower leaked down the wall, causing water to pool out on the bathroom floor. The ceiling above the shower looked like it had mold on it from a leak from the bathroom above us. The hair dryer was filthy. We did not sleep well at all the night we stayed. We just did not feel safe. Only GOOD thing I can say about this MOTEL is that the water got hot. Stay far, far away from this place."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"During the beginning check in- everything looked very quaint and as if it had a decent amount of value. It appeared as if it were very clean. I went out and had dinner- came back- relaxed, all was well. I was enjoying an infrequent bit of quiet time away from my soon to be ex-wife. However, during my sleep, I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom. This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable to crazy at a hotel. The staff was very nice- extremely personable and friendly. However I don't believe there was anything they could have done at that point that would have made me comfortable. So I left."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"As I walk over to third floor where my room was, I noticed that the area was very dirty and unkempt; water was dripping on the stairs and looked unsafe. When I got to the door of the room I was given, I notice that the door was very, very dirty and sticky.  I gave it the benefit of a doubt that it was cleaner inside, since one should never judge a book by its cover, however when I open the door, I was meet by the moldy odor of the room.  That when thing really turn for the worst.  The AC was on, which made the foul smell worst, I went over to the standing AC, it was all corroded, the control panel cover was busted, there was no control knob.  So I had to turn off the AC, by turning on the metal piece.  The paint in the room was peeling off, the door frame was busted, the room was dirty, and the floor was dirty.  The room was just nasty."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The buildings are old and in disrepair. The furnishings are old, mismatched and worn out. I booked a room with 2 full-sized beds and a pull-out couch. They sent me to various rooms, none of which were what I booked. We ended up in a room that seemed to be a 1 bedroom suite that had the living room furniture removed and a bed added. Space was really tight and the whole thing seemed cramped. The description of the hotel claims that a restaurant is located in the building. The menu for it was taped on the door. We were informed that the restaurant had closed. They also claim to offer free wifi, but I was never able to access it. The microwave was broken. The best I can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water and the AC (only 1 unit, in the 1st bedroom) worked well. Luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to shower & sleep for 1 night. I cannot imagine staying there any longer than that."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The air condition very dirty the beds had bed bugs my daughter's got bitten by them. Told them about that and they just brought clean sheets. Never again will I book we that hotel again. They also have false advertising. They said they have breakfast and they don't. Only coffee.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,needs makeover
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"When I saw my room,  I canceled it. It was stressful for me because I was really tired."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,In my life stay there its terrible no clean nothing attention no servicesnever recommend these close!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The nice staff show me 3 different rooms neither of them could be considered a hotel room to stay. I cancel my stay and went to another hotel
Fiesta Inn and Suites,average
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Lots of holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Fiesta Inn and Suits should not be on Expedia list. Room was filthy, it is a crack house, checked in at 4:30 pm left inmediatly at 4:45pm . You could see the sale of drugs inside the hotel. They charged me $93.38 and refunded me $46.59 after 15 minutes that I checked in. They said they have to charge me because I already checked in. Left and whent to Howard Johnson hotel, problem solved. This Crack house is giving bad reputetion to Expedia. The San Antonio police department and health department should take care of this problem.Nothing"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"La regadera no serviaEl cuarto lo limpiaron a las 9 de la noche , nos pidieron que salieramos para limpiarloHay cucarachosEl desayuno es pan con mantequillaPara el precio es malo"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I GUES IT IT COULD BE INPROVED AS FAR AS CLENING IS CONCERND THERE IS AN UNPLEASENT ODOR IN THE ROMM AND INSIDE THE SHOWER THEY NEVER CLEANED IT AND THE GARBISH SOME TIMES IT WAS NEVER REMOVED SO ONE MORE THING ITS QUITE DIFICULT TO GO ACROSS FOR A NICE RESTAURANT SO EITHER YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR RESTAURANT OPEN OR HAVE A FRE RIDE ACROSS THE HIGWAY BECAUSE ITS TOO EXPENSIVE TO HIRE A TAXI JUST TO CROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE TO HAVE A NICE MEAL OR TO GO SHOPPING.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Horrible, la peor experiencia, no deber��a ni salir este hotel anunciado en la pagina..."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"No respetaron mi reservaci��n, la habitacion en malas condiciones. Me dieron un cuarto de 1 cama y yo reserve de 2. NO LO RECOMIENDO"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No hot water and very dirty.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel is definitely the worst hotel ever!!  the room smell was awful, bathroom was disgusting,  vanity faucet was loose, roaches crawling all over, shower/tub was super filthy,  we did not take a shower that nite, we went to walmart and bought the biggest thickest towels they had and put them on the bed to lay down on cause with all the roaches crawling around , we figured the bedspread was dirty.  didnt sleep all nite cause roaches were even crawling on the bed. we had bought some snacks but couldn't eat in there.   Got up early, turned in our key and went to McDonalds to wash up and eat breakfast. Worst experience i have had with a hotel!!!  I regret Not  remembering to take pictures of the room to share with others."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel looked good on the Expedia site, so I booked it. When I got there the rooms were in terrible shape, by far the worst hotel I have ever seen in my life. The room was filthy, cockroaches everywhere, the furniture looked worse than garbage picked up off the street. I am not kidding, every room was worse than the next, not what the picture shows.The service was even worse, no towels, no soap, no trash cans, my bed was literally broken in half, not one time in the 4 days did anyone come to clean my room."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Especial should not even be associated with this establishment. Dirty, wall lamps missing with wires hanging from walls in more than 1 place,  unsecured curtain rods, cigarette burns on the bed and throughout. Disgusting"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"tuve muy mala experiencia en ese hotel todo esta sucioy aunque la habitacion era no fumar aun asi olia mucho a cigarro,las recepcionistas en todo momento estuvieron en su telefono celular y era muy poca la atencion que pusieron"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Pros:I think I was unintentionally bumped up to a suite (or maybe all of their rooms have two beds)The beds are comfortableCleaner than I expected from a rating so low (two stars, I believe)Free wifiFriendly staffCons:Thin towelsStrange smell in the bathroom (not a bodily function smell)Terrible breakfast (pancake mix and cereal)"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and the experience is the same. The price is very good for a family on a small budget but with that comes good and bad. The bad never had towels the whole time we were there, the pool had alot of clorine and was still dirty along with the poolside it was covered in cigerette butts and bird poop. The room wasnt much better we found ourselves in a room when the ac worked periodically, the shower curtain was falling off, and there was a smell of smoke in a non-smoking room. The staff was great anytime I spoke with them they tried to take care of any need I may have had. We arrived on a Friday which is the day they have happy hour and they serve you drinks and food free of expense and added this time was live entertainment. We didnt spend alot of time at the hotel but if your looking for a place to rest your head thats in a great location I would recommend this place."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,horrible staff was rude door was broken in one of my rooms some doors had holes freezer was dirty
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"No sirven chapas, puertas en mal estado , pesimas camas, pesimo servicio , fue necesario cancelar el dia que llegue pague una noche sin quedarme"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Tv did not work and no towels in first room. Lady at front desk did not seem to want to change my room. Second room was moderately better.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Absolutely Horrible!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I was told over the phone I would be able to get my room early around 12 and had to wait till 4pm. The hotel isn't top of the line either, but it could use some renovation to make it look more presentable / appealing"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I don't recommend this to anyone.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The hotel is not upto US standards. The room is filthy & smelling. May be ok for young guys to come on trip; but definitely not for a family. Hotel has to make up on the rooms. It is very disappoining.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room I got was an efficiency with two rooms. The A/C was in one room an it was hot the bedroom. I just wasn't what I booked. The price was outrageous for what I got.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Filthy kitchen, filthy fridge, filthy oven, filthy living room, lumpy uneven beds, only one towel for a room with four guests and two beds, no continental breakfast (despite the sign outside saying so,) no batteries in the TV remote, no mat to wipe your feet save for a shredded up towel that was soaked through by the rain anyway.Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in.To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.)Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess.I'll be disputing this with my bank. Meanwhile, never book this hotel. Any of you. Whole place should be closed down and sold to somebody who knows how to run a business."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was surprised to see how dirty the stove top and bathtub were. I am sure both would have been cleaned quite nicely with a good scrub brush and some Soft Scrub. It made me wonder how clean everything else was. The couch we had to sit on was pathetic. The overall experience made me feel like we weren't in a clean room and that is just creepy. They do have a store that seems perfect for incidentals that are forgotten. The staff is friendly but clearly they could use an extra person. The requests I did make for service were delayed because the front desk people were too busy. The hotel is across the street from a discount store and a discount movie theater. It is also not too far from a major mall in San Antonio. These make the location acceptable.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel looks as if the owner has given up... The room was clean with the exception of ONE dirty towel in the bathroom. The Hotel itself was hot and the tiles were cracked and looked dirty... half the hotel is under renovation right now but not sure if its being renovated or just shut off... The hotel front desk is extremely nice and helpful to any needs or concerns, my one complaint on thier side would be the lack of knowledge of surrounding resturants and attractions. The Breakfast consisted of Brown food... Coffee, bread, creals (bran, frosted flakes, and maybe rasin bran) and waffles... The Stay was OK and because we only used the room to sleep we didn't have to many issues... One more thing you can tell the hotel is on an old water system bc when ANYONE flushes or uses water the shower goes hot and cold..."

Fiesta Inn and Suites,we had to leave because there was no a/c in the room and roaches crawling everywhere
Fiesta Inn and Suites,FIRST 4 PM CHECK IN TIME? WHAT'S WITH THAT. SECOND WALKED INTO ROOM AND IT SMELLED LIKE IT HAD BEEN SMOKED IN AND VERY VERY MUSTY. THIRD THE BED HAD A SINK HOLE. WHEN YOU LAY DOWN YOU WOULD ROLL TO THE MIDDLE AND ONCE THERE THE SIDES WERE HIGHER. VERY HARD TO GET UP OUT OF. THEN THIS WAS THE WORST.... NO WASH CLOTHES. NO BATHROOM MATS.. I EVEN ASKED AT THE FRONT DESK AND WAS TOLD NO THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY.. UNBELIVEABLE.ALSO THE DOOR TO THE ROOM HAD STRIPS OF WOOD MISSING NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR. WALLS HAD REPAIRS THAT WERENT DO VERY WELL AND THE ROOM WAS JUST PLAIN UGLY.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Terrible room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the first room that they gave us had only one bed. i had ask for two. i let them know so they send me to another room with two beds. the beds and the rooms were not clean at all. the air conditioner was not working at all. when my wife went to tell the clerk, she said that all rooms were like that. we ask for our money back. they are suppose to give us credit in three days. hopefully its true."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,A little paint and new mattresses would do wonders....also exterminating.....I wish I had taken pictures
Fiesta Inn and Suites,lights did not work in one room and smoke detectors and some switches were hanging out of the walls. other than that friendly staff and maintenence was working around the clock to improve the hotel. for the price it was prettu good!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Instalaciones muy viejas y deterioradas. Ol��a muy feo.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,One of the worst hotels I have ever been in! Upon check in the clerk asked if I wanted to inspect my room because she would not be able to change it after approval...1st hint. I checked out the first room...gap in the door frame so large that anyone could easily break in. i asked for another room...got a mini suite. Refrigerator was frosted up so no cold air in the fridge. AC was barely able to cool the room. Room was old and dated. After one night in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom I had had enough. I took a shower and I noticed that my feet were leaving dirty footprints in the bathroom floor! I immediately called Expedia and got the room refunded and went somewhere else. AVOID THIS DEAL!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Not only did I not feel safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty. Floors not swept. Shower covered in scum, stove never cleaned. Duck taped front door. Nasty and dirty let alone the cockroaches.. Then to top it all off they didn't even supply us any towels. No wash clothes, no hand towels, no bathing towels. I had to go to the store to buy bleach and towels just to be able to shower.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. EVER no matter how cheap it is."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I was too far from who I came to see. It was roaches, uncomfortable beds, no real tv channels,and the furniture raggedy."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Inexpensive so value for the money. But some items that ensure it is the lower tier of motels. No shampoo, leaking toilet, no running water in sink. Shower OK and that's what was needed anyway. Window AC, Old CRT TV. Nice aspects of separate bedroom and living are with full kitchen - fridge, stove, Microwave"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First thing I saw when I walked into my room was that the TV was plugged into an outlet on the other side of the room with an extension cord draped across the middle of the floor. Next, it seems as though the ""maintenance person"" had been trying to snake a clog from the toilet because they left the snake IN the toilet along with a brown sludge.I went and asked for another room. The hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly, so I went back AGAIN and had then reprogrammed. The next room looked as though the door had been busted down MULTIPLE times as the lock was barely hanging on to the wood and there were holes in the frame where it looks like it had been kicked down. There were a lot of strange people around who appeared to live there as well. I'm assuming the cockroach on the kitchen counter also lived there.The room had no trash receptacles whatsoever and the heater did not work which made for a rather cold sleep as it was between 40 and 50 degrees out that night. I had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early. I slept on a couch in the airport the next night waiting for my morning flight and was much more comfortable and felt much more safe than I did at this hotel.Absolutely would tell everyone to steer clear of this hotel at ALL costs."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Let me start by saying it was my fault for hastily booking a room and not reading the reviews. We simply wanted somewhere to rest for the night before we headed back home. When i pulled up I was so disappointed. The outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour. The inside of the room was terrible. Water did not work properly, there were no towels, there were stains on the couch, chair and floor. It was so bad I didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture. This was supposed to be a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke. There were also cigarette burns on the wall. The shower didn't work and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced. We didn't bother to stay. After 20 minutes we packed our bags and left. The front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back and gave us the run around about the room being used therefore no refund. I even called the owner and Expedia and they both gave me the run around. This place should be shut down. No one should live here. This hotel should not even be listed on Expedia. Again i was in a rush and i didn't read the reviews so it is truly my fault. But a place like this should not be allowed to advertise."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Roaches. The most uncomfortable beds you can think of. Nasty bathroom. Towels were more like wash rags. Nasty place overall. Can't beat that price though.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was looking for a cheap hotel just for the night and came across this one thinking it wouldn't be that bad. Wrong! It's crackhead central. I worried that I was gonna end up getting hurt or that my car would be broken into. I've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one takes the cake. It was downright scary.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Roaches in room, Carpet soiled and worn. Tile in room greasy. Drapes falling off rods. Door jambs busted. Sheets uncleaned and stained. Hotel should be removed from Expedia site. Enough said, do not book this hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room was filthy and disgusting.  Roaches (MANY) running around...unknown substance smeared on walls...carpet was dingy and dirty...room smelled...Do not book here - you will regret it.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The hotel is centrally located and a good price, but would not recommend it to anyone. After arriving from a very long drive, walked in to find a huge hole in the wall, power outlets poking out of the wall, burns in the comforter, phone didn't work and no remote for our t.v.. The next day took the family sightseeing only to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned. The housekeepers never left clean towels that's when they did decide to clean our room. The pool was always filled with drunken people that left all their beer bottles and trash behind. I would never stay here again!!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,A/c not working and roches
Fiesta Inn and Suites,it was the worse hotel ever check out the same day we check in
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Holes in the wall....door jam busted....no lights...smell of urine.....roaches...not worth 5 bucks!! Need I say more.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room was not prepared well for one's visit. The cover sheet was stained. There were no tows to use initially.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The customer service is horrible, the staff is very rude and they lack customer service skills. The rooms looked decent online but once you enter the actual room it is a whole different experience. The room smelled of mildew, the stove, fridge, and shower were broken. The furniture is very old fashioned, the couch showed wear and tear, and the bed was very squeaky. I was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but I cut my stay short because I could not stand staying in this hotel any longer."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"During the beginning check in- everything looked very quaint and as if it had a decent amount of value. It appeared as if it were very clean. I went out and had dinner- came back- relaxed,  all was well.  I was enjoying an infrequent bit of quiet time away from my soon to be ex-wife.  However,  during my sleep,  I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom.  This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable  to crazy at a hotel.  The staff was very nice- extremely  personable and friendly.  However I don't believe there was anything they could have done at that point that would have made me comfortable. So I left."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Don't stay here even if it's free
Fiesta Inn and Suites,There was notmany toliets in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"So disgusting we didnt even spend the night!Pillows were stained and had no pillowcases!Room had a stench and it was just disgusting!Never again will i book at a ""no name"" place!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Ha sifdo probablemente la peor experiencia de hotel en mi vida���, un hotel no s��lo con las peores condiciones de higiene y limpieza, sino adem��s con un p��simo mantenimiento"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I paid for two nights but did not stay after I saw the room the whole hotel was nasty expedia should not even list a hotel like this
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"una pesadilla en la primer noche de las que ten��amos planeado a las 4 de la ma��ana nos levantaron a golpes en la puerta, eran los bomberos que ten��amos que desalojar de inmediato por un incendi�� en el hotel, toda una pesadilla para mis hijos, s��per sucio la habitaci��n ol��a s��per mal, no hicieron el aseo, etc. nunca volver��a a ese lugar!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The first room they put us in had not been totally cleaned and it was filthy. They put us in another room which was acceptable - kind of. There was a hotel party there that night and they had music playing all night long, along with kids screaming, dogs barking, and police sirens blaring until late in the night. Didn't get much sleep."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Never stay here! Staff very friendly, rooms are awful. Had to change rooms first day. At least the 2nd room was cleaner. The shower didn't work, reported it but they never fixed it."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Muy malas condiciones del hotel,las camas quebradas.el refrigerador en malas condiciones y sucio. En s�� toda la abitacion en mala condiciones"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Hotel is a converted apartment complex. ""Suites"" are actually apartment units. Lots of trashy people LIVE there. Broken curtains on all windows. Beds with broken frames, filthy matresses, and dirty bedding. Freezer and hair dryer out of order. Worst hotel I've ever visited."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First night too tired to fix problem.  Sheets were stained and dirty so slept on top of them.  I told Hotel Desk Clerk the next morning about it an that I didn't have soap or even a washcloth, and to change sheets and dirty pillow cases.  That evening, I still didn't have clean linen, I slept on top of them again.   I had soap, and towel and washcloth.  The next morning  after I used the new towel, I discovered I had been given a dirty towel that had been used by a woman with red lipstick and long black hair.  I was by myself.  I was never so happy to check out of a hotel."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Noisy and dirty place do go for it any more
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"I asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds for 4 people and They gave me a two bedroom super small suite and one of the bedroom had no airconditioning only ceiling fan and you had to leave the light on in order to work, so we had to leave the door between both bedrooms open and lower the air condition in order for the other room to get a little bit cold so we where freezing in the first bedroom. The outside door did not closed properly no continental breakfast only coffee. super dirty stairs Never, Never will stay there again. Very expensive. We were two families staying in this ""hotel"" and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave. staying."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"el trato es muy amable por recepcion , y pacientes ya que yo no hablo ingles, nos gusto el servicio y la tranquilidad, definitivamente lo recomiendo."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Room was not ready at check in .. no heat then switched to another that had roaches,  smelled like gas , no remotes for tv"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Wrost hotel ever
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Wrost hotel ever
Fiesta Inn and Suites,restroom dirty and their was roaches going into the fire detor
Fiesta Inn and Suites,It was clean. Liked the tv/living room. Kitchen was a plus but I couldn't buy any groceries to cook because there wasn't any provided pots or pans. But for a small place for a cheap price it wasn't too bad. And the food was a good snack if u didnt feel like driving anywhere.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was very uncomfortable. Had bugs everywhere.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The blow dryer did not work properly it will turn on for a few secounds and then off for like 5 min I was not happy.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"From first sight, it looks old & beaten up. But I still decided to take a chance. Walked into the lobby to check in & there was a lot of strangers walking in & out. Once I got my key & went into the room, the room smelled like someone had died in there. There was dead bugs on the floor, the TV cables were cut open, no door to the restroom, the restroom smelled beyond disgusting & the windows were broken but taped. My husband and I were so mad, we went back to cancel and get out money back. DO NOT stay here. It's very shady and disgusting. Never again. They should be reported."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"While I write this, I am getting sick again thinkkng about he experience. I walked in the room and walked right back out.  I feel foolish for not reading the reviews first."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Nasty dirty rooms. Bathrooms were not clean and there where roaches all over.I do not recomend thisnoalce at all.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Worst experience ever... Everything was so nasty and dirty!! Would not recommend to anyone.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Hotel a 20 min fuera de la ciudad en carro, es viejo, sucio, en p��simas condiciones, tiene cucarachas andando por todo el cuarto, colchas sucias, cortinas, sill��n y sabanas quemadas de cigarro, los cuartos huelen a cigarro, humedad y mugre no es opci��n para hospedarse pues es imposible dormir en esas condiciones ademas de que gastas mas en taxi para llegar a la ciudad. al rededor del hotel solo hay Walmart y restaurantes de comida que debes de caminar como 15 min para llegar a ellos. La alberca es un chapoteadero.Cero recomendable."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This hotel should not be listed available on Expedia. The accommodations are reminiscent of a crack house. I checked in to another hotel within 10 mins of sitting on what was assumed to be a needle free couch.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The clerk at the check in was very sweet and kind. After traveling i just wanted to check in quickly and get to my room. The woman at the desk was very sweet and explain all details of the hotel. She even directed me to where my room was going to be. The rooms were very clean and had alot of space. Love the fact that the room came with a stove and fridge. The hotel is located in a very good location. Where it was easy to find places to eat and shop. Loved my stay here at the Fiesta Inn. Oh and the breakfast bar was wonderful!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Do not waste your time! Theres no way aNY living thing could stay here comfortably. Room was dirty & smelled overwhelmingly like Raid & cigarettes!! No towels, toliet paper or soap. Furniture was falling apart. The girl at the front desk was rude & told me I'd be refunded for the days I had booked.. However, I was not."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Two days to get towels. Carpet turned feet black. Had to light pilot light in stove and air out room. Bring raid with you. Beds very uncomfortable.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"well in fact all those pics on the website are not true, the building is in bad conditions, I order a room with 2 beds, so they put another bed in the area of the tv, well you get what you pay"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"dangerous. non-smoking room was not non-smoking. filthy. shower had mold and mildew and tiles were caving in. there weren't any trash cans in the room but there were empty coke cans with cigarette butts throughout the room, tv would not even come on, windows would not lock, microwave tray was covered in something disgusting and sticky. this hotel was so bad that I booked 2 nights - got there around 11 pm couldn't sleep or bring myself to ""bathe"" in the filth, left at 7 and did not come back for the 2nd night. worst hotel experience of my life."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,it was good but the bed was nosey and there was people fighting in the other room they should have security
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This could have been an awesome experience but the rooms were not very clean. We had only 2 towels no hand towels no wash cloths. No cups. No ice. No extra pillows or blankets.There we no Trash cans in the rooms. We have booked rooms through Expedia on several occasions,  but this was by far the worst experience. I can assure you that if we book through Expedia again and we draw this motel we will cancel our reservation and go else where. This was quite a disappointment after our past experiences be so completely opposite."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The room was crawling with roaches, the furniture was stained, And the bathtub was not clean. I had to find the cart to get soap and towels.  She was out of soap so was substituted shampoo for hand soap."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I really enjoyed staying at the Fiesta Inn! I loved the kitchenette and the pool was great!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The only problem I had was that there was only 1 a/c for the suite & the other room was hot, while 1 room was freezing. Also the showers in 1 room did't work, I was quickly changed from rooms, but that room the water never regulated. It went from hot to cold to freezing, to scolding hot. Overall it was what I paid for. I would not stay there again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Es la verdad muy sucio y en pocas palabras p��simo hotel
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"There were roaches, only two towels, Dealers and women who sell themselves living here. Blood on the walls and soiled sheets and chairs. Not a place for a family!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This was the most disgusting place I have ever walked into in my life. It looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub. The room reeked like old smoke. So thick you couldn't breathe. The kitchen was filthy. The walls were yellow and sticky from smoke. I was afraid to sit down in the place. I walked in and left 5 minutes later. We did not stay there! I will be requesting a refund as we had to find another hotel. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Ever!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Terrible, the whole place stinks like a bar, the room itself is in poor condition, sheets are filthy, and ceiling tiles are falling down and moldy, place all around is filthy. I give hotels.com 1 star dissatisfied for having such low standards for having this place on the list"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No deber��an tener este hotel en su portal un hotel caro para los servicios q presta. El edificio se esta cayendo adem��s es sucio y las habitaciones no cuentan ni siquiera con papel higi��nico
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"En muy malas condiciones, muy sucio, con peque��os insectos que me obligaron a irme a primera hora de la ma��ana siguiente y perder una noche porque ya estaban pagadas dos y ��nicamente estuve una."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,roach motel
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"the hotel owners do not care about the hotel or the people staying there. the building needs a lot of work. the room is dingy, dirty and all the items inside are old and/broken. the room they gave us had a decent lock design, but the frame and door did not match so there was a large gap around the door. the AC unit was coming out of the wall, the appliances are old and dirty(no light in the fridge, frost in about 1/5 of the freezer, blow dryer didn't work due to a bad plug), bulb missing from the lamp in the living area and the ice machine in the hall doesn't work. the cleaning and maintenance crew consisted of older people who did enough to get by. we never received fresh towels or someone to come clean out the room. when the lights went out in the bathroom, it took 3 hours to get someone to come by. instead of bring a bulb, he came, took the burnt bulb and then came back again 10minutes later. Internet was pretty much nonexistence in the room. they kept saying that they have to reboot the router, but after a day of trying, they blamed it on time warner. the internet in the lobby area was great though, but that's not where i want to spend my time working. the pictures on Expedia are probably a few years old. we only used the room as a drop off point for our stuff as we were out most of the time, so if you don't plan on ""staying"" in the hotel, it's ok. still would have liked fresh towels. if i knew i could upload pictures on my review, i would have taken some."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Se les olvido hacer el aseo durante dos dias, tuvimos que sacar la basura por nuestra cuenta."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I couldn't get towels for my room.. Hotel was dirty..Couldn't check in till 4.. Would not recommend this place to nobody..
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was horrendous I would not recommend this hotel to anyone whatsoever, there was a lot of shady people hanging around in the middle of the night & there was a guest smoking marijuana on the staircase as we made our way up to our room."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The customer service represenative were nice. We didn't have any trash can in our room..and we were asked to come and pick it up at the front desk because they didn't have enough people on staff. I thought this is a bit rude.There were no towels in the bathroom. The queen bed had an hing that cause a cut on my husband's leg because it was poking out.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Did not stay,very unclean, smelly, roaches. Sorry but true"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,very poor a nightmare
Fiesta Inn and Suites,It was nasty and dirty it had rats and bugs on the bed
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Si pides mi opini��n te aconsejo que te quedes en otro hotel.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Do your self a favor and don't stay here. I had a hard believing previews reviews and this place isn't even worth a one star. Horrible customer service and the place was completely gross. Roaches everywhere and dishonest front desk staff. The place is completely trashed on the outside by what looks like looks who stay there.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No towels and the neighbors were loud. Front desk rep was rude.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"No Towels, broken locks, smells like smoke in a non smoking room."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Hotel was just filthy. It was in a great location, but so gross. I had reservations for 2 nights and left a day early. So dirty that I could not stand to sleep there."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Most disappointing stay so far for me in the US.Never faced such a pathetic experience.The hotel from outside looked dull but i thought the rooms would be good.I was given a room key , when i checked the room , it was very dirty , bed was dirty , a nasty smell was emanating. To put it in one sentence , ""it was terrible""."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"NO RESPETARON MI RESERVACION A PESAR DE ESTAR PAGADA. SOLO CONTRATE PARA LLEGAR A DORMIR. LLEGO Y NO HAB��A HABITACIONES, ME IMPROVISARON UNA HORRIBLE CON UNA SOLA CAMA Y UN ASQUEROSO SOFA, ERAMOS 4. TUVIERON QUE DEVOLVERME EFVO. MUY MAL SERVICIO, PESIMA EXPERIENCIA. NUNCA MAS REGRESO."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Omg!! People, just don't do it! So unplesant!! Creeps, thiefs, crackheads & prostitues surrounding this place!Horrible smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"El desayuno..solo consiste en ceral con leche, pan tostado con mantequilla o mermelada y jugo...nada de fruta fresca, ni waffles, ni cafe..ni ninguna otra cosa...."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This hotel has a lot of potential, but it's so broken down and dirty. The rooms are set up nicely, but it looked as if the room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart. I'm definitely never staying here again."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Shower didn't drain. The rooms were dirty. The towels looked like car wash rags. I have never stayed anyplace this nasty. Wouldn't recommend for human shelter in event of natural disaster.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"hotel appeared rundown and old, fixtures were outdated and did not work. breakfast was lame, towels were old and thin. Very disappointed."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Mala e irrepetible
Fiesta Inn and Suites,The room are to dirty smell bad like tabaco not safe at all all
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Roaches, shower didn't work, used toilet paper roll, pillows way past expiration lol would never recommend this place Doesn't even deserve a star"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First off their website and sign outside the hotel said continental breakfast but when we got their they told us they didnt offer it anymore. Then the room was trashing one of the beds sank in the middle, the stove didnt work and they had to bring us a new one, they only cleaned our room once the whole week we were there, we had to beg for towels and then they would only give us 2 at a time even though it was a room for 4, we had to beg for toilet paper. The blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was a non smoking room. Then there were these weird guys who watched us the whole time we took our stuff into the room and and every time we would leave or come they would be watching us we told the people in the front and they said they had security to watch HA! never saw any security. then one of the men who was 26 yrs old tried talking to my 15 yr old daughter creep! they also kept asking if we wanted to buy drugs and all kinds of stuff it was very scarey!! All night long kids were running around back and forth to the pool because they never closed the pool. It was awful and I will never stay there again and dont recomend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Despite any notions of ""how bad can it be"", keep driving one block to Quality Inn or 2 blocks to Beaumont. Do not be taken in by room photos - they are of another room in some hotel in an alternative universe to that in which the Fiesta Inn exists."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"AWFUL!!!! We didn't even stay, we had to go somewhere else.. Lots of roaches!!!!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Well, where can I start. The hotel is disgusting. Roaches everywhere, half of the stuff in the rooms don't work. The shower was broken. The coffee pot did not work. I called front desk and they said they will replace the coffee pot, they never did, the refrigerator was leaking water. Roaches everywhere, front desk was not helpful. Above all the property itself is old and needs a overhaul. The pictures on the internet are very deceiving. Stay away from this hotel, if you are looking for a miserable stay for the weekend this is the place."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,wow where can I starta lot of little roachesvery bad moisty smell dirty stained bed sheets broken toilet I didn't even stay 2 hours I had to get out of that place. I can't believe this hotel was even listed in Expedia
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Would not recommend or stay here again. Room was nothing like the pictures on the website. Sheets were not clean. We could not open up the sofa bed because it was so close to the furniture. Overall cleanliness was not good.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Please consider another place for your stay. The management recommended that my companion and I go to the room first to check if any of the lights were out and to make sure the room is properly furnished before we pay for the room because there is a no refund policy. The first room we went in to check had no lights in the living room, the hair dryer was previous stolen, and the room smells like smoke. This hotel is horrible. The furniture, whatever is left of it is broken, dated, and unclean. The furniture smells, the floors will make your feet BLACK in 5 seconds. The bed is a super hard box spring with the thinnest possible bedding on top. The towels provided were so thin, you'd need two to do the job of one."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place used to be an apartment complex & the mail boxes are still there. Place is run down, old furniture & not a very clean place. I left my room at 9:30 am & when I arrived back at 10 pm my room was never made up. When I complain to the desk I was told to take it up with the manager in the morning.I had to ask for new towels and take my trash out myself.Only good about this place is they have gas stove."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"First of all, the front desk had a very unkept, shady atmosphere about it.  I could smell cigarette smoke everywhere.  The first room they offered me was one in which the front door did not bolt shut.  The second room, bolted shut, but I was still leary since I could see the drill marks where this door had been repaired several times.  The springs were shot in both beds, and they were not Queen Size as advertised.  I saw a couple of roaches crawling in my kitchen.  This hotel should not be listed in Expedia.  It is a safety and health risk.  The WiFi did not work."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The stay was good, great location, need inproventment on room service, never had towels, the motel was clean"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The staff is friendly and helpful, the kitchen was equipped with what we needed, there was always someone around property cleaning something, the rooms have ocean and bay views. The hotel is within easy walking distance to CVS, shopping, and dining. We were very pleased and we are making this hotel our home away from home when in South Padre Island."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was the filty,roach infested, the sheets had not been changed sence the last guest or more, there was mold every wher! HORRIBLE CONDITIONS!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Don't stay there please. Drug  activity and prostitution arround that place
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"Decided to not stay, very bad vibe when we got there. Asked for a refund right after we checked in. Get what you pay for"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Should change the name of the place to the shady crap stain inn
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place was Nasty. There were roaches crawling around. My room had no light in the front living room, no tv, had mattresses on the floor, the door to the bedroom looked like it was kicked in, the room had an odor...it was Nasty"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"For this establishment to give the name of FIesta Inn and Suites is a bad form of advertisement. The ONLY association they have with the Theme park is that it is not that far from there... Also in my opinion any 4-5 star reviews this hotel gets I believe were posted by staff/owner! Two words for this place is Gross! Gross! This hotel well if what we had was a suite then....I just don't have words because 2 weeks later and I am still stunned and finding it hard to believe I stayed there 1 night. Breakfast made me ill to my stomach. I did not feel like I was in clean hotel when it came to the room. The appliances in suite were from 1960 and fridge was leaking water from icebox. Stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not cook anything on it or in it. Plugs did not work through out and no AC in room...it is is living area so to get this AC air you have to sleep with door open. The bathrooms although for most part clean the tub was dingy, the sheets appear decades old (along with lumpy mattresses, flat pillows and decore from the 60's). This establishment is great for a budget minded person but I predict foul practices from not so savory citizens happen here (as evidenced by our room door having been kicked in on numerous occassions-it was hard to open and when you did get it open the door at bottom where frame and door meet was split). I was this close to sleeping in my car with my family instead. Never will I stay here again. Nice staff but not nice hotel!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"That was the worst nightmare in my life,roaches, dirts I even took pictures ,that was hell ,they make you sign a paper that they re not responsible for any lost belonging in your room , people trashy smoking by your window ,wifi doesn't work .i never recommend no one to stay there ,I was supposed to stay for 7 days ,I checked in at 11 pm and I checked out at Midnight and they kept my money"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"muy deteriorado, sin mantenimiento, de hecho estaban en reparaciones, pero necesita una remodelaci��n total."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"muy deteriorado, sin mantenimiento, de hecho estaban en reparaciones, pero necesita una remodelaci��n total."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"when we arrived a lady was complaining and comment not to even think about staying there. we move forward and got our room keys, as we walk up to the room, room door was open and the room had been use. we went ahead and gave it another try, went for another room key, disappointed to death; the 2nd room had no light and the smell of urine was awful. extremely disappointed."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk. She gave me a key so I can check the room before she can check me in I can tell already this is not going to be good. Got to the room it's filthy and bugs are crawling around. It was late I need a place to stay so I have to deal with it. And I will say never again in this motel.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,This is one step to close hotel. Room is stink. Bed is bad as sleeping floor. No room cleaning or bed making. Why am I stay? Just too tired to move. But you need rest do not go there.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,I was very unsafe in this place. Drug deals happing and very dirty. I am thank full to hotles.com for getting me a refund so I could move my family some place safe. This needs to place should be removed from your list.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,No COMMENT
Fiesta Inn and Suites,the hotel was full of cockroaches. cockroaches were moving everywhere even over the bed.didnot like the stay from any perspective.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"It was the filty,roach infested, the sheets had not been changed sence the last guest or more, there was mold every wher! HORRIBLE CONDITIONS!"
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The room was crawling with roaches, the furniture was stained, And the bathtub was not clean. I had to find the cart to get soap and towels. She was out of soap so was substituted shampoo for hand soap."
Fiesta Inn and Suites,Disappointing. I do not recommend this motel. Thanks.
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"This place was miserable. It took over 20 minutes to check in. There was only one towel in the room and its cleanliness was questionable. Upon requesting additional towels, we were promised more towels, but they never made it. Every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on it. There was no chair to sit on to work at the desk. The room smelled bad. There was no shower head. The security lock on the door was broken. We will pitch a tent on the side of the highway before we stay here again."

Fiesta Inn and Suites,Cockroaches everywhere !!!!!!!
Fiesta Inn and Suites,"The pictures are deceiving. Everything you can think of I can say something bad about. Lighting fixtures messed up, bed slumped, bathroom not well kept, the list goes on.... I do not recommend Fiesta Inn and Suites and would not return even if I was paid. Very disappointing."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Bed was hard and shower curtain had dirt on inside that look like mold. My stay was nice overall though.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,i hope services are better this time !!! lol ;)
Ip Casino Resort Spa,My stay was great except housekeeping did not do a good job cleaning the room.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Very friendly staff whos security doesn't oppressively tail you like one of the other casinos I stayed at to the point that it offended. Activities for the kids so that parents can do adult activities without kids in tow. Always my choice when traveling to Biloxi.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"crowded elevators, bad mattress, three dollars for a bottle of water"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,always great entertainment every night!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Nice property at a great price. Spacious and clean room, comfortable bed, free parking, nice rooftop pool. Close to dining options, Visitors Center and highway. Will stay again if back in the area."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"beautiful rooms and pool(when open)! the floor isn't as player friendly as it once was, and you really have to work foe it now!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We had a great time! Enjoyed the Pool and food. Fun for the whole family
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Beautiful room. Nice hotel large bathrooms with granite counter tops. The only cons were the trash cans were extremely small! I could barely fit anything in there. And there was no microwave.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"at a height of 335 ft (102 m), the ip's hotel tower is the second tallest building in mississippi and features windows on every floor."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The stay was overall good. The air condition in the rooms are motion-controlled or something. No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,IP is a beautiful hotel.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great stay. Definitely will be back!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,cabana is $40 for a half day. 10-2 or 2-6. includes 10 free non alcoholic drinks. such a deal.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Stay was disappointing. Had to start with the need to park the Motorhome more than three blocks away and had to walk in the heat. Just for stupid reason that the lot was going to be paved and would not hold the weight THere were nine of that came and stayed in the hotel-just needed a convenient place to park. Been coming for many years, but no more. We left Beau Rivage for same reason."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Very comfortable rooms. But parking garage is a long walk from check in and hotel elevators
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Everything was great, room service, the casino. the nightclub, the gift shops, I loved everything. Totally friendly staff."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Parking gridlock!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The Spa, the Restaurants, the Gaming Facilities, the pool, all top notch."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Outside of our hotel room which is great, the rest of the hotel needs a little updating. The kitchen staff serving breakfast seem tired and never smiled."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Room was a lot bigger than expected, we stayed in a room with 2 queens and there was still plenty of room. Sink didn't drain very well and the hotel sent someone up to fix it immediately. The only complaint was the temperature of the room. We tried adjusting it to make it cooler, but it didn't seem to matter."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Everything was good with the exception of Back Bay Buffet... The price of the buffet was not worth the poor selection of food...30 per person jst too much and not tasteful at all
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Dont go without mothballs
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The alarm going off continuously over a cigarette in an elevator and expecting people to run die 25 flights was ridiculous
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was for 1 day but we loved this resort
Ip Casino Resort Spa,My only complaint was valet parking upon check in and check out...I felt that it was very chaotic..
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I had booked a non smoking room. Unfortunately when we arrived we were booked in a smoking room. We thought it would be ok but it was actually gross and we hated it. We asked to be switched to a non smoking room and they told us they couldn't do it due to availability. By the time we departed, we all had sinus infections."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Pool side bar=awesome
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Enjoyed our stay can't wait to go again !! I would recommend the hotel designate smoking areas in the lobby area instead!! The lobby smells like smoke !!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Clean,quiet,comfortable and spacious room with a wonderful view.(also with a mini refrigerator).Casino setup is well laid out.The buffet (lunch) was excellent."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"the best soup and salad bar in all of the mississippi gulf coast, bar none!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Love it!! I will be coming back
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We had a very pleasant stay at the IP. Service and food were great. Stayed 3 days.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"We went to the IP for a quick getaway for our anniversary, the room we were placed in had dirty towels from previous guest on the shower curtain, the sheets had hair as well. They moved us to a second room and when my wife went to step in the shower , the shower door fell forward hitting her on the shoulder. They did rectify this by moving us to a suite and giving us dinner for free. However, it was a horrible start to our anniversary. The hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of other things to do at the site. That's a plus."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,looser slots - for sure!!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Awesome time. We loved the pool area also.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Nicest cocktail waitresses in town. Sometimes you don't even have to ask for another...
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The pool experience was great, a little crowded but great to relax and soak up the sun. The room needed more attention, stains on the wall and carpet and didnt like the fact that the A/C controlled by the hotel."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"excellent ,32 is excellent as well"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Beautiful hotel. I am a non smoker and even though we had a non smoking room the smell is in everything. It is s very nice place if you can deal with cigarette smoke
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Would not stay here again. When we arrived our room smelled of sewage. Had to be moved, took several hours of our trip time. Advertised as a family place but way too many people for comfort. And nothing screamed family. The arcade room was not well equipped."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Loved our overnight stay!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The hotel was beautiful and well maintained. It was within a mile to the beach and shopping.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Parking elevators too far from casino and room elevators for us old folks!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Horrible experience with lady checking us in. Very rude told her 4 times we wanted a king bed. After getting to room discovered she put us in room with 2 doubles anyway. Called front desk and they were more than happy to swap our room to what we wanted. Great staff aside from one perdon
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Was in Biloxi for business and got a good rate at IP. Like the restaurants and bars, too."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,nice clean rooms with great beds!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I enjoyed a quick trip with my 2 kids and we had a wonderful time. The beautiful pool and arcade entertained my kids and the food was excellent. We will definitely visit again.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Our 1st time at your casino. great place, food, staff rooms. great service from stephanie at front desk on check in check out. Hope to come back and spend more time at your facility. Great maid service House keeping when when we has speacial requests"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Looser slots - FOR SURE!!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"IP is a beautiful romantic type hotel! We stayed here on our wedding night and decided to come back for our one year anniversary, and it was awesome from valet to the staff! I live this Hotel!!!!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,people coming from other areas where there is no smoking in any common areas it was very difficult to walk through the lobby while people smoke. Also no HBO in room.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was good but they shut down pool at 9 and opens at 10 but u can gamble all nite. That upset people! How will they comment to that
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Rooms are great and the seafood buffet on Fridays is a must try.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"IP is my Biloxi choice I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING! At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too. The view from the room was of the ocean ... while yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :) The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :) Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. I will never stay anywhere else."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Our stay was nice. Casino wasn't the greatest. We didn't like the fact that they actually charged the 100 deposit to our card. Now we have to wait 5-7 days for a refund. None of the other hotels did that to us, including Beau Revage."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,have you considered eashing the windows?
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I will plan another trip there
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Everything was great! One thing: the water did not get hot enough for me. Maybe something small for someone else. But not for me. Aside from that, will stay again if I had to."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I checked out around 2am. Only one person was ahead of me but it took 25- 30 mind to check out. The front desk clerk was deeply engaged in a personal conversation with the guest who was checking in. Neither one of them was concerned about me waiting to check out.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Our stay was great until we received attitude from pool area staff because they kept asking if we needed something and when we would say no they started having attitudes toward us. Why would we need anything when we rented a cabana and received 10 free drinks to go in the mini fridge. The kids and I were there to enjoy the pool not buy food and drinks. Very disapointed with that service.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Stick with beer n shots. You know how much alcohol is in them.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,has a world series of poker circuit tour stop once a year.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Stay was awesome!! Check in and out process was streamless. The pictures were very accurate for hotel rooms, pool, casino, and buffet and amenities. Well recommend if stressing in Biloxi. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet were great!!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,nothing good to say
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was ok.some loud knocking not sure from where.the bed sheets didn't look like they have been washed had old hair an some dirt an the top blanket had some cigarette burn holes.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"There was clearly tension in the air. It's Biliox, Mississippi.... Racial tension was within everyone. :-( Time heals!!!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"They were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we came in. The room was impossible for a non-smoker to stay. When we complained, they put us in accessible room still was not smoke free. This is a terrible hotel for non-smokers"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,great place. wonderful bloody mary's and super friendly staff.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Horrible. Walked to smoked filled lobby. Air quality of this hotel was horrible. The fact that you had to walk through lobby and go on opposite elevators to get to pool was ridiculous. Definitely not a family atmosphere. Will never stay at this hotel again.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"At a height of 335 ft (102 m), the IP's hotel tower is the second tallest building in Mississippi and features windows on every floor."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"This was our first time to stay in a Casino Resort. We loved the hotel, the staff, and the amenities, even though we did not participate in the gaming. There are plenty of things to do that don't involve gambling. My husband and I had a wonderful time."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"My saty at IP... which started by the greeting of the valet attendant and as I walked into the door to check-in. Although my total experience, ranging from staff on the casino floor recognizing I had a lost look and asking if they could help to staff in the restaurants was excellent, one stood out - Ihave an inner-ear health issue that riding elevators can cause me to get sick or pass out, so I usually just use the stairs. At check-in, the lady at the front desk (I only know as Erin P.) had my 2nd floor room pull and ready. After I checked in, she told me finding the stairs can be difficult the first time and she took me to the stairs and made sure I found the correct door. I can assure you base on my experience from check-in services across the nation this was beyond the call of duty as most would see."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,When I booked my room I had booked nonsmoking. When I checked in all that was available was smoking. I wasn't happy !!! I had just travel from Texas. I didn't have time to look for another hotel. I guess it makes no sense to book a room here. They clearly don't care!!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great hotel
Ip Casino Resort Spa,New Non-Smoking area in 'The Cove'.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Valet parking sucks!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Had an excellent stay
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I only have one issue. The parking garage is very far from the rooms. We had to carry a lot of personals would have been nice to have a cart to put our things on.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"we stayed one night and loved it. perfect views from room, gambling was a blast. room was amazing.beach 5 minutes away if that."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Their shampoo is Awful. If you have hair and care about it not looking dirty and feeling gross bring your own.  Only complaint though, everything else was very nice!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We were there for anniversary. Could t comped even a buffet.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Had a great time! Valet was faster then parking in parking garage! Great service. Food at Tein was excellent!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Decided to go for our 6th anniversary. Went to the pool on day one and it was super crowded with kids, and saw lots of people with personal coolers and their own drinks. Day 2 decided to bring our small cooler with a couple of bottles of water. We got there early and there were no seats to be had, and kids EVERYWHERE, splashing-completely unregulated. :( We were yelled at by the pool staff as we were leaving for having the cooler/ drinks, when there were ton of other people there with the same thing. Very unprofessional on her part. She should have been stopping people at the front door, instead of yelling at guests while they were trying to relax. Other than that, our stay was very nice and the rest of the employees and hotel staff were very friendly."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Everything was positive about this hotel! Check in line was long but, moved along in a timely manner! We were even up graded to a better room which was awesome! We will definitely be staying at the IP again in the future and I will tell others about our pleasant experience!!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Check in was horrible. Took about an hour to get checked in. Check in staff was very slow. Check out staff was slow as well. Other than that had a great stay.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"fantastic place to stay, the rooms are fun & the staff was beyond helpful. can't wait for my next visit."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Don't pay full price for drinks!  Head to the ""torch"" bar in the casino.  Order whatever you want for free and tip the bartender a buck!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The casino allows smoking and some of the rooms were smoking. That smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at the IP again.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Enjoyed myself
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Holy crap it was smokey in that place!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great and easy access off of the highway
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I did not like the pool separated from the hotel. I did not like taking one elevator in the hotel, walk to another elevator to get to the pool above the parking garage."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was great. The room was nice and the hotel had everything we could possibly ask for. The only thing missing was a microwave in the rooms.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Two thumbs up
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"To compare IP Casino Resort Spa for free, you can check Ticketwood.com, the free comparison search engine. Read more"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Toilet overflowed in the am. Fight broke out outside our room. Had to call security. Room smelled of smoke even though non smoking room. Buffet line was an hour and a half. For 30 per person food was not good. Room was warm even though we lowered the thermostat.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Very nice room. Very comfortable and a beautiful sunrise every morning.Bathroom was amazing. Dining was very good. Pretty close to beach and shopping. Will stay there again.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,nicest cocktail waitresses in town. sometimes you don't even have to ask for another...
Ip Casino Resort Spa,not enough non-smoking areas in casino...coughed for 2 days because of all the smoke.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,very thin walls. heard children and adults screaming in the hallway all night long. lady at check in was rude and I was hit with another fee when I checked out. so I paid more than I had expected. the room was very nice and loved the view.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"This is a hopping hotel, but it was very hard to find and the counter staff was cranky! Also, many of the restaurants are in the casino and hard to get to. Don't bring kids under 21."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,do not order the pickles at high tides. disgusting!!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The stay was very good. We will stay there again. We think this is the best hotel/casino for your dollar in the area. However there were little things (with our room) that we did not report. 1) The toilet ran 2) one of the phones was broken 3) the black out curtain was not completely operable due to broken hooks(morning light seeped in) 4) the air conditioning did not work properly as the thermostat needed to be set on 65 to have the room comfortable. I am sure if we could obtained another room, but did not think too much of the issues until we realized there were many. We did not want to unsettle ourselves."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Hate i didnt come sooner
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"omg! had the best time at the america concert last nite& then had a fabulous meal @ costa cucina. ask for rosemary. the best server, ever!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Pool only open until 900
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"well i don't know who added the location to the imperial palace, but it is in Biloxi, MS not LA, there is no such place. Read more"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"This stay taught me to not stay at a casino resort again. The room was clean and comfortable, but to get questions answered or any service was a nightmare of getting passed from one person to the next to the next (for something as simple as where can I place outgoing mail). The restaurants and shops inside are convenient, but you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,i like spending money and this is a casino. i'm pretty happy.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Comfortable and fun..some of the staff was cordial, some were rude and the security staff was very helpful"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Very clean, well appointed rooms. No complaints at all! Hotel and casino are rather large. The bank of elevators for the casino and parking garage are quite a ways from the room tower elevators. We liked that because it forced us to get in more daily steps. There is a wonderful rooftop pool with a huge TV and fun bar. Family friendly, too!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The hotel was great. But the casino part had way too much smoke in the air. It was probably the worst I've been to.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Great room, food, and casino"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great hotel at great price. We really enjoyed it.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Front desk a little slow at checkin. More agents would have sped up the wait time(about 20 min) Hotel clean and personnel all very nice.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,pays out better that the other casinos
Ip Casino Resort Spa,32 is the best Resturant. Awesome food!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Terrible vibe in this hotel. People and staff were unfriendly, room was stuffy compared to others we stayed in during our trip for the same price. Bed was uncomfortable. Did not enjoy our stay."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Club is okay
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Nice clean rooms with great beds!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The room, location, and activities were great"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Me and my 2 grandchildren went. 1 st time here. The game room needs to be bigger and security needs to be in game room at all times. I rented a cabana that was very nice. The bathroom and bathtub needed to be bigger. A luxury bathtub would have been nice.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Try the Cheesecake Martini. It's absolutely fantastic!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was great but your slot machines were to darn tight.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,very enjoyable granddaughter loved the pool elevators were a little inconvenient but for a relaxing vacation it was great
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The room was clean and comfortable but I found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We stayed 5 nights. It was very clean the staff was awesome. There was plenty of things to do. The elevator situation was interesting. Sometimes there were so many people waiting it took a good half hour to reach your floor. Finally after being there a few days we would just get on one and eventually we would reach our destination.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I enjoyed my stay. I do think that there needs to be a few upgrades added in the rooms, such as renovations of tub and toilets, plus the addition of microwave."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great place. Wonderful bloody Mary's and super friendly staff.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Visited here mainly because it was one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening to go out. I had never been to a casino in MS and had been over 10 yrs for my husband. The food was great! We were extremely disappointed though that no one gave us any information about specials until after we had eaten. Turned out my husband could have gotten a free meal. The place was very nice but got little info on where we could find what we wanted and waited more then a half hour for the drinks we ordered.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,take care of your bartenders and cocktail waitress and i promise they will take care of you!!! best bar on the coast!!!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I thought that some of the staff were impatient and crude.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Awesome concert tonight.. Quiet Riot
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Melissa Etheridge concert was great, it was like the United Colors of Lesbians meeting,or someone stole the Olivia mailing list!  it was GREAT tho....."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"love the ip! great place to hang! great rooms, casino, food my favorite is the rooftop pool!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,not impressed with the rooms. the price you pay you would expect a little more
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"We usually stay at chain hotels, but IP provided a once in a while festive atmosphere, kids love it."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We enjoyed our stay. The room was good and the view was good. The casino was current and easy to maneuver.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Really hate the new point system.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,club is okay
Ip Casino Resort Spa,ladies drink free thursday nights at chill lounge.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great hotel for the price. Room air conditioner not adequate which made for a long night. The hallway was nice a cold.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,great wings @ storts bar
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We stayed at the IP on July 10th and 11th weekend. We chose to stay here as we had tickets to see ZZ TOP. The auditorium was an excellent venue to see any concert in. We fully enjoyed the concert. The staff at the IP are very friendly and we did not find anyone that was not. We did not like the Hotel Room as it was probably the worst Casino Hotel room I have ever stayed in. The entire place especially in the Hotel rooms has a musky smell. It could be a smoke smell but we had a Non smoking room. Casino was fine but I will never stay at this Hotel again as for the smell and the actual rooms were much less than desirable. Nice friendly place but the Hotel part just sucks. Go here and Enjoy but I seriously recommend staying somewhere else.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"As a couple who visited casinos all over, we know GREAT employess when we meet them. I.P. Casino is our favorite and michelle is the best, most efficient beverage server ever. Keeping her 'mt's picked up. She has an enormous ability to make old people feel young. Her smile and upbeat attitude is the bright spot in our saturdays."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great martini selection!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Wonderful hotel!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,place smells like smoke.. even in the non smoking places. yuck for us non smokers
Ip Casino Resort Spa,there is a hot tub in the pool area it's free and looks over the ocean. awesome view.  also in the rooms is a snack bar thing that if you open it and move an item you will be charged for it
Ip Casino Resort Spa,IT WAS THE BEST STAY THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE ENJOYED IN A LONG TIME.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,My stay was VERY COMFORTABLE. The staff are extremely accommodating. The ONLY negative thing I can think of was that it allows smoking in the casino lobby areas. I would come back again!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Great hotel, will stay here anytime we are in the area. Only negative, was the cold water faucet in the bathroom had very little water pressure."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Love going to the IP with boyfriend or friends from work! A great time every time!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"the spa, the restaurants, the gaming facilities, the pool, all top notch."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"We really enjoyed the seafood buffet and a wonderful dinner at the Italian restaurant. The wait to check-in was excessive and annoying, not very organized. Wait time for the elevators was also way too long."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I had a sprained ankle and asked for assistances with my bags, no one showed up. We waited 15 to 20 minutes. My air conditioner was not working properly, I also ask if they had a microwave to use and was told no, we don't have a microwave. I've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the reason I checked backed in this hotel. This time wasn't so great, I got a standard room. Valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming, they did a great job!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"For the money, you can not beat it!!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Quiet relaxing
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Eat at 32!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Room was very comfortable and the elevators were very efficient for getting everyone where they need to be. I have always like the soap and shampoo when I stay here too. It's on the bay and upper floors all have nice views.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Place smells like smoke.. Even in the non smoking places. Yuck for us non smokers
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"This was our annual Anniversary Trip Getaway. We had stayed at the IP on one other occasion and enjoyed it. This time it had the best rate available so I chose it. It has a nice rooftop pool, good restaurants, nice gaming floor layout, good live music, and is close to the beach. All in all it was perfect for our trip. I would definitely stay here again."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I really enjoyed my stay the food was awesome I will definetly be coming back.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Our stay with IP was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very well kept up. My only complaint is that IP is not walking distance to the other casinos.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"hotel casino resort is nice,but employees watch you like ur a criminal, they dont want u to bring ur own towels to pool an ur not allowed to take pool towels to room so its pain in the blah when u have kids an need to wrap them up to take them from pool to room wet,, then even tho i was with my kids the guards tried to make my kids show id to walk from hotel to pool or parkin lot,,kids arent old enough to have id yet. also the wall socket in room did not work an i asked the bellman about it but he couldnt help then noticed one bed did not have a blanket but when tryin to ask housekeeper she couldnt understand me an i realized she didnt know english..game room arcade needs a major upgrade needs to be non drinking and smoking since it is for the children also needs to be open later, we tried to enjoy the few games in it but had a wad of grown drunk men come in all loud an rough while they climbed on an wrestled on the games,,had to leave to prevent my kids from gettin hurt, those things aside this resort is nice"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Not impressed with the rooms. The price you pay you would expect a little more
Ip Casino Resort Spa,good slots
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Everything was perfect. They made the ballroom into a winter wonderland. Teresa helped me through the line to get me a plate of the delicious food and also made sure we had to go boxes to take with us afterward.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Hotel was good, but room we had, air din't cool as good as should. Would have helped considering it was 98 outside. Other than that a few small cleanliness issues in bathroom. But overall really good."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"We had a fun time in Biloxi, the hotel was exactly as advertised, the room in the pictures looked EXACTLY like the room we stayed in. The pool area was a little odd to get to as it was on the roof of the parking garage, but the pool is very nice. They absolutely will NOT let you leave the pool area with a pool towel which means you should bring your own unless you want to travel from the parking garage, all the way across the hotel while wet. The Italian restaurant on site is decent and priced well. We had two rooms on the trip, the TV did not work in our second room for two days. The only channel on the TV showed adult programming at night, which meant since their were kids in the room TV was not an option. To be fair, we called the desk about this once, then complained again the evening of the second day and they fixed it right away after the second complain so most likely they simply forgot about it, but this does not reflect well on the staff. The lowest rating I give the hotel is the staff, other than that its a great stay. The main thing that bothered me was telling a 4 year old who stood there shivering that they couldn't take a towel to the room."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I was blown away at how much I enjoyed my stay at IP, even though it was just for one day. I was traveling back home to San Antonio from Orlando, and decided to stop halfway through my trip to get some rest. Never having been to Mississippi, I did have some slight reservations, but when I got to the hotel, everything had changed. The front desk staff were more than friendly, very outgoing, and told me about signing up for a free players card in the casino to get a free buffet upstairs, which by the way was AMAZING. All the food and desserts were awesome, and my server was lovely. The room was extremely clean, bed was comfy, and shower was good. To sum it up, if I am ever to take another road trip through the south, I will stop at IP! Thank you so much for everything! :)"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great stay only problem was smoke smell All staff was great
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Craps tables on Friday nights!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Noisy neighbor. Called front desk twice with no answer :(
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"If I could give this place a negative 4 starts I would! They're rude!! From check in to coffee shop!! Rude!! The room was filty! Wifi and valet included Wrong! We were charged extra for everything! First they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid for! They then tacked on added fees! And couldn't explain why I would recommend you stay anywhere but here! If you want to gamble, stay at the Best Wersten and go to another Casnio! anythng good people say on here must be paid to say it, I saw nothing but rude staff and filth! And we paid to be treated like that!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Fun place to stay, good food, wonderful spa!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Room service is on point but I do not recommend the steak n eggs for breakfast
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Try the Chill lounge, nice."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Room was not properly cleaned we had another person's shoe in room and broken glass in room and bathroom. Housekeeping never showed up to clean room after we complained.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"ac units in the room suck.   you can turn it all the way down, but 74, maybe 72 is the best you'll be getting.  enjoy"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Very nice People People look like they are enjoying there job all the time and all ways willing to help and willing to get you anything you need

Ip Casino Resort Spa,"It wad very comfortable, we felt safe"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"This was our first stay at the IP and it definitely did not disappoint. The room was nice, great AC, and the blackout curtains were amazing!"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The staff was a little rude while checking in, other than that it was great."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Always ck to see what promo is offered at casino
Ip Casino Resort Spa,It was okay. Room could've a microwave and better view and better fridge for the price that we paid. I requested a king size bed but I arrived they gave me a queen bed. That was a big strike. Bed was uncomfortable.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,can't wait to see Jamie Foxx!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great pool!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"stayed for 1 night went to show at beau revenge app 1 mile straight down street everything went well had to ride around when we came back at 10:00 pm, parking lot was full but in 10 min found a spot!"

Ip Casino Resort Spa,Imperial Palace roof top pool is very cool
Ip Casino Resort Spa,The hotel was great. Restaurants were good and service was wonderful. The only downfall was that it badly rained the whole stay and we didn't get to use the pool

Ip Casino Resort Spa,I only stayed for one evening. The overall experience was fantastic. I recommend visiting the spa.

Ip Casino Resort Spa,Check out the buffet !! Yummy
Ip Casino Resort Spa,always ck to see what promo is offered at casino
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Always great entertainment every night!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"We wanted a king bed and was told we had a room with 2 queens. The desk rep was very condescending when she said the king was based on availability and since I had only made my reservation 12 days ago, I was probably on the bottom of the list. There was a long line to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32. There are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor the entire time. Poor planning to only have 2 available at check in. To get to the pool, you have to either walk all across the lobby or through part of the casino to get to the elevator. Pool area was dirty with cigarette butts."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,they have a non smoking section upstairs!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,this grey goose martini is tremendous
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Beautiful rooms and pool(when open)! The floor isn't as player friendly as it once was, and you really have to work foe it now!"

Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I love that there is so much to do without having to leave the hotel. The casino, a bar, multiple resturaunts, and an amazing pool and hot tub that also has a bar. Tien has amazing food if you are interested in chinese, veitnamese, etc. The pool had multiple on pool lounge spots perfect to just relax away from the heat but not be completely submerged in water. Also the beach is only minutes away if you'd like to enjoy the sun, sand, and gulf."

Ip Casino Resort Spa,My fiance and his brother and I came to boloxi for cancer surgery. Upon checkin I was asked the purpose of our stay and when I told Thomas he stepped away and came back and told us that the IP was upgrading us to a king suite for his pleasure before surgery.

Ip Casino Resort Spa,valet parking sucks!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Sink wouldn't drain, no microwave, beds uncomfortable, no free breakfast. Discount for food offered to everyone which I think should be for hotel guests. I expected more from this location especially since I paid 1k for one week."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"The room was very nice, however the walls were very thin. We heard everything that was going on in the room beside us... I called the front desk were I was told that they would look into it but nothing was done. I received no sleep at all and we were there for relaxation. This was not a very good first impression."

Ip Casino Resort Spa,Love love love this hotel stay here every time I come to town.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,play the dollar sizzling 7 machines after dinner..seem to run through a pay cycle around 7:30 that last about 45 mins
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Good: bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept it! Bad: Valet service was terrible when entering. Not enough attendendants at peek times. Attendendants didn't want to direct traffic if it entailed getting in the sun to eplain where entering cars had to go. They preferred to to stay under the canopy and the entering guess we're left unattended in the drive. Poor service there. Enter for check in and line was long, that's expected. But only 6 agents to handle the crowd is why there was a back up. IP is a nice place. Great pool area. Resort fees for a hotel in Mississippi(it's just a hotel in Mississippi) I was there for a concert, the room was prepaid. Then the hotel changed the date of the concert and charged me more to change the date of my stay. That I'd say was poor judgment on their part. I explained when changing the reservation that it was IP's fault that the dates changed. That didn't matter to them. They gladly charged me another 33 dollars per night. Plus resort fees. Fool me once."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,great place to lose your money!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,rooms are great and the seafood buffet on fridays is a must try.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,bring a laptop/ipod... they have free wi-fi! [:

Ip Casino Resort Spa,nice room. comfy bed.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Relaxing
Ip Casino Resort Spa,pool side bar=awesome
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I felt the room was dated and cheaply appointed. The TV was small. The Mini fridge was not turned on and warm. There was no coffee pot thus no way to make coffee. And the biggest annoyance was there was no Water in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3.00 a bottle water. Really. Charging for drinking water and NOTHING available in the room. Absolute worst on room amenities for a Casino Hotel. I stayed one night.......dropped a few hundred in the Casino and you couldn't provide drinking water in my room. I probably wouldn't return, as I was unimpressed."

Ip Casino Resort Spa,Great place to lose your money!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,My stay was a weekend girls trip and this was my first time staying at the IP. The rooms were very clean and food and bar service very good. Elevators were SLOW and the valet staff was not friendly. Sometimes not even a Hi or Good Morning. Will stay here again though.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"the wife and i was on our 2nd honeymoon and it was awesome.... we made a little money gambling and everything was just perfect.the pool , hot tub, casino, work out room ...we absolutely enjoyed and can't wait to come back. we want to stay longer so maybe we will get a chance to see boomtown and other places. the hotel was so exclusive we never left. great stay great hotel, thanks IP resort and casino"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Was very nice updated like the connection Between hotels Boyds places are great
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING! At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too. The view from the room was of the ocean ... while yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :) The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :) Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. I will never stay anywhere else."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,No hot water during our stay. The fire alarm kept going off on other floors and we would get closed in by the fire doors with no idea of what was going on until they would announce that we could go on with our normal activities. Coffee shop employees are very rude and obviously hate their job. Only plus to our trip was the pool staff and quench bar employees are wonderful.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"Room was spacious, clean. King bed was very comfortable. Wifi worked. No complaints. I would stay there again."
Ip Casino Resort Spa,Love the pool here and many upgrades have been made to the rooms! 32 is a must do for dinner! Great wine selection. Very good food at the sports bar and shows are great here. IP can handle any event! Read more
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We were there for the 2016 Classic Car Cruisin the Coast. IP Casino is a little away from the action but also away from the noise. Yet close enough for easy access to the activities. The swimming pool was outstanding.

Ip Casino Resort Spa,"hotel was not very accommodating to our needs. Had four people in our room and had to beg to get enough towels, etc. Very disappointed in housekeeping, left dirty cups, glasses, etc. Hotel also failed to give a 10 casino free play as promised by Hotels.com when I booked the room. Some hotel and casino employees were nice and easy to deal with while others were difficult. It may be a long time before I return"

Ip Casino Resort Spa,"OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS GREAT, WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK LOVE THE CITY OF BILOXI"
Ip Casino Resort Spa,We stayed at the IP on July 10th and 11th weekend. We chose to stay here as we had tickets to see ZZ TOP. The auditorium was an excellent venue to see any concert in. We fully enjoyed the concert. The staff at the IP are very friendly and we did not find anyone that was not. We did not like the Hotel Room as it was probably the worst Casino Hotel room I have ever stayed in. The entire place especially in the Ho... view moretel rooms has a musky smell. It could be a smoke smell but we had a Non smoking room. Casino was fine but I will never stay at this Hotel again as for the smell and the actual rooms were much less than desirable. Nice friendly place but the Hotel part just sucks. Go here and Enjoy but I seriously recommend staying somewhere else.
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I had a great stay and the casino food was excellent!!
Ip Casino Resort Spa,I had a good time. I requested a room with a king size bed but they gave me a room with

Ip Casino Resort Spa,We were disappointed with the bar options. Main bar didn't open until 5:30. We had to go
Ip Casino Resort Spa,"I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING!r r At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too.r r The view from the room was of the ocean ... wh... view moreile yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. r r We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. r I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. r r The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :)r r The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :)r r Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. r r I will never stay anywhere else."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Seeing as it's in the middle of Maine, you're not going to get a 5-star hotel. However, this is probably the best in the area. I've had WiFi issues here in the past, but this time I had the 3rd floor, and no issues at all. So, I'd suggest 3rd floor."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Overall a good place to stay. Restaurant served a great dinner although it was noisy ,because it was wing night, it attracted a lot of beer drinkers. Also the room heater/fan was noisy. The sit down service breakfast was excellent and had a good selection."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Adequate but nothing to recommend it.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the ""grand"" from the name."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Great service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!"

They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Hotel was very clean and staff very nice. Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy. Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Free breakfast was great dinner not so much. I don't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"It's a decent hotel for the price. They provide a solid breakfast, and the rooms are really nice. The only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in the back of the building."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The staff was fantastic. Nice room. Could have used more than 2 bath towels. It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter. I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim. It was a good stay and I would stay there again.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I've been in worse hotels, but not in a long time."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"It feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovations. However, I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations. I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel smelled musty and had to move rooms water in shower would not turn off did not fell or smell clear either room would not stay again
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This hotel was being remodled and should not have been renting rooms on the second floor where we were assigned,it was a total shambles including large holes in the curtains and debris laying everywhere. How could they expect anyone to stay in that kind of environment. We looked at the room and left and rented another hotel, we had already signed in and were werelocked into the contrac with our prebooking through expedia. We are disappointed with expedia on this one."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,One night layover. Hotel was good for that but wouldn't want to stay more than that
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.  The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable.  The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells. The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil. When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned ""Free Breakfast"" - what a joke. It's a voucher (1 person is allowed $7 off a breakfast of the menu, and $14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. It's really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"traveling with just myself and 2 small kids and the staff was helpful and kind,the food in the rest. was great and affordable."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"the hotel was great , clean etc. but that one desk lady was like not to helpful - and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer didn't have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions - except to say. yes, those computers didn't work right and that she knew you couldn't open any attachments and that staples was across the street."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Dejligt ophold Heldig med vejret s�� vi kunne sidde udenfor og spise aftensmad
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Very nice room.loved the pool. Could have been lower in price but would stay there again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Checked in unexepectedly at the last minute. Never spent enough time at the hotel to make any other fair comments. Everything was perfect for what we needed.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"OK hotell i utkanten av Waterville. Ganska lugnt l��ge. Hotellet har pool, restaurang och bar och ��ven tillg��ng till g��sttv��ttmaskiner + tummlare."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"No coffee in lobby, front desk suggested I but some at the hotel restaurant. Parking lot was icy and not plowed, even after several complaints. Did not comply with Platinum Status rules. Reservations didn't match room location. Front desk staff was not knowledgeable. Room was nice."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,its also a naborhood pool.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light, clearly caters to groups and sports teams. Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly.Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We enjoyed two great days away. They let us check in early and check out late for free. The hot tub was great, pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman. Wifi didn't work well with just one of our three devices. Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for. Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This hotel is showing its age. Although my room was clean, everything seemed a little run-down. The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it. The security latch was loose and missing at least one screw. I booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip. When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn. For some reason I didn't see these on the hotels.com website."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Excellent for short stay. Very comfortable bed for good night's sleep.Breakfast a bit disorganised and could cause a problem if on tight schedule.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Excellent free breakfast & friendly staff.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Good parking for vehicles w/ trailers.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Old and run down. Tried to eat at the restaurant in the hote for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out. I would not stay there again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room was very large, comfortable bed, very clean and most important it was very quiet. The breakfast was reasonably priced and very good!!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"staff were great ,rooms very clean, bed was comfortable and very close for all your shopping needs"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Room were clean, Bed was comfortable, bathroom was functional. Skip the breakfast the service is very, very slow and food is sub par, they overcooked the eggs Benedict I ordered, plus the cost of 4.25 for juice is expensive. I would recommend going across the street to the Governor's Restaurant Bakery. The front desk was very helpful and accommodating....Dear Lawrence S - Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to write this review. We're glad you enjoyed your room and our helpful staff! I apologize that you did not enjoy your breakfast at O'Brien's. We will pass along your comments to their management!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I've stayed here many times over the years while traveling through maine. Very friendly staff. Their pub has relatively tasty food too! Rooms are clean and the beds are so comfy! Rooms also have all the amenities you could need for your stay!
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nothing major to speak of however this hotel is quite comfortable
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until 6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Clean, comfortable. I really liked the shower and the shower curtain!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room.The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee? I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Room was good and very clean
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased. The hotel was recently updated. The bathrooms were beautiful. Our beds were comfy and clean. The pool and hot tub was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside. The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia. When I inquired, I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill. Breakfast was tasty but kind of pricy in the restaurant, the hotel did give us a credit but only for the registered adults. Not a free continental as advertised."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees hazardousworkingconditions
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We enjoyed ourselves. Loud at night in the hallway but it was a weekend night so it's to be expected.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon....overcooked circles of leathery meat.It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasn't worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel.There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"met or exceeded all of our expectations, breakfast was included and was fantastic."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The room was clean and comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was very good.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Perfectly fine stay off the interstate. Accessible to downtown with car.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Excellent free breakfast friendly staff.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Easy access off I 95. Extremely courteous desk staff. Clean room and common spaces. King -no smoking was indeed that with a very comfortable bed. Highway noise was minimal. Be sure to get your voucher for basic breakfast which is a hot, fresh breakfast for free! Great coffee. Plenty of parking and close to downtown Waterville for access to restaurants... More"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was comfortable. It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers. Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use. The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We were touring colleges for the week and this was my least favorite hotel. It just did not feel very can and up to date. The location is convenient to Colby.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Went up for a family visit. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Had a good meal in the restaurant. Convenient to stores of you forget anything.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Needed a convenient reasonably priced hotel for a college reunion.this hotel fit the bill.the room was clean, the staff courteous, and the breakfast buffet (included in the room cost) good."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,This was a nice place to stay.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Smell of freshly smoked marijuana in the halls on the way to the pool all day long. Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didn't appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. ""Free"" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Great location, easy access to the city"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,It's warm and normal....staff is diligent and polite. Price is a function in these parts and I appreciate the consistency of service.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs & cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I am in Waterville every year for fire department training and always go home disappointed about the local accommodations.  This year my hotel was clean, quiet and very comfortable.  Aside from a bartender who had no personality the stay was perfect."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly's next door where it was cleaner.I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Easy to access from I-95, close to restaurants, shopping, nice little town."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We only stayed one night but this is a good place to stay. Newly updated it shows with better mattresses and new decor. The hotel is clean and well laid out. It is centrally located with many places to eat. The only negatives were the wifi which seems to become very slow once the hotel filled up and one tv... More
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. We were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of being completed, and hopefully will continue. The rooms are dated, but clean. We had dinner in the bar area and breakfast in the dining room. Both were excellent with generous portions! If the need arises, we would definitely stay at this property again."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,This is one of the friendliest hotels that I have stayed in. All of the staff was very helpful with anything that I needed during my stay. The hotel was clean and well decorated. I will be staying here again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"No problems, except that it would be good if you would provide tea bags for the people, like me, who do not drink coffee. Also, you should use larger type for your questionnaire, for those, like me, whose vision is not all that good."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Check in was quick. The room was comfortable.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I booked 2 separate days for my stay. Upon checking in they told me that I had one stay booked. It was annoying however we were able to straighten things out
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice hotel for the price. Great for a short stay. Breakfast discount a nice touch. One of the best inclusive breakfast I have had!
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Gave me excellent directions to my n ext destination
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,it was very good
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We travel and shop in Maine once or sometimes twice a month ever year and normally we stay in Bangor, sometimes we would even travel a little more south to Augusta and drive right by Waterville. Now this isn't the first time we stayed here, maybe half a dozen times, but this is my first review. We realized that inflated...Dear Wayne Jean - We're so happy you enjoyed your stay! Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel! Look forward to your next stay with us, and truly hope to see you again soon."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Even though I booked/payed through Expedia, when they swiped my credit card for incidentals they somehow charged another room to my card.  Two days later, still waiting for the charge to be removed from my card."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel is just off Interstate and easy to get to anywhere U need to go!!
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,excellent place to stay and food was super...great breakfast and friendly staff
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"WiFi didn't work at all for my entire stay. Drain in bathtub very slow, takes a long time to get hot water."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Rooms fairly small and bathroom really needs updating. Bed was a nice size! Not very good value for money and little to do within a walking distance.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I had a nice time at the Best Western Hotel. It was clean and the staff was friendly. the work out area and pool was a good size and the hot tub was relaxing. the restaurant was resealable, but the only thing there I didn't like was getting a water with dinner that came in a plastic cup. Over all it was a nice stay."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"They should clean the rugs around the elevators, The room was very clean"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Breakfast was included, but only for half of the people in the room - unknown at time of reservation."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I was in room 216, on the 2nd floor. I found it very convenient that each floor had a close-by drink vending machine and ice machine. We were able to do laundry for cheap up on the third floor. The pool area was nice, relaxing hot tub. I have a disability where I have a hard time walking so I...Dear erincorbo - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review!

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,was promised an executive suite...got jammed into a small room with a micro wave and fridge and they called that executive.carpet was not clean ..no other trooms available when concerns were voiced
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"First time at a BW Plus and we were pleasantly surprised. Very clean, very comfortable, staff amazing and best breakfast ever. To be truthful, there was no downside including the price, which was very fair"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Needed to leave a day sooner than expected, knew this at check in and told them so. But since I had booked thru Expedia, they stated that I had to get approval thru them, which I did. Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that. But the next day, my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay. In calling the front desk, I got form letter like answers. I will never use this Best Western hotel or Expedia again."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,All of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of nooks and crannies to the hallways of this hotel.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Great hotel to stay ,,Was there for my niece to see Unity college"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit. The unit made odd snapping noises periodically, had to be set on the lowest setting to not overheat the room (58 degree setting made it about 70). The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been ""patched"" with aluminum foil."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a 14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice! Friendly! Quiet good breakfast nice stall free newspaper
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Wonderful stay, Staff was so helpful"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel was clean and decent.. Service staff were friendly and helpful.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Staff was very nice rooms could have been I little bigger over all it was good
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel had all the amenities and the included breakfast which was fantastic. Best of any hotel I ever stayed at. Ordered off the menu for a minimal extra charge. Room was clean and roomy.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Mes enfants ont ador�� la piscine surtout pour la temp��rature de l'eau sal��e et de l'air ambiante. Surtout apr��s une sortie de ski de fond le matin (�� 5 km) et du magasinage en apr��s-midi. Les journ��es ��taient bien remplies.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming.My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The house keeping staff was kind, but when I asked for things for the room they would tell me to get them myself. The restaurant was not good and the service was worse. One waitress told off another in front of everyone and another waiter ignored our table after taking our order."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees #hazardousworkingconditions
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room was very spacious. It had a good size fridge, decent microwave and coffee pot.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area. Instead it was in between the hotel and connected function facility.Pros: The room was clean & comfortable. Check out is at NoonCons: The door would not close by itself & the water in the shower backed up.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Went up for a family visit. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Had a good meal in the restaurant. Convenient to stores of you forget anything.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,our stay was great.my grandson really enjoyed the pool.My son & wife took advantage of the fitness center.would have liked to see the menu with prices otherwise great
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Overall, happy with the hotel. Good Value here. Here's a quick tip for weary travelers - grab a hot and ready 5$ pizza from the Little Caesars that is two doors down."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Delightful stay, nice room, good workout facility and pool, handy to Colby, but slooow service in the restaurant."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"the property is ageing and shows it how ever they are remodeling a little at a time. The staff was the best of the best . a great Irish pub and Restaurant. unfortunately no entertainment not even a Juke Box. The staff here was Fabulous. the pool, Hot tub and Exercise room were top shelf."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Awesome hotel, we brought our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved the saltwater pool it actually helped his dry skin he had on his back. We took turns trying the hot tub which was amazing as well. Had a beer in the bar and ordered dinner to bring back to the room, the bar tender was very friendly and food was good too. Overall our stay was an A+!!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,good
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room was clean and in good condition. The walls thin, so heard people in the halls and the fridge was noisy. The staff was excellent from check-in to the restaurant. Food was good and a good value. The Pool area was ok, However the Hot Tub was broken and in poor working condition."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Enjoyed staying
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel is OK. We stay there because of the big, warm, indoor salt water pool. Service could be better - concierge didn't give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Overall not bad
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I thought the place was great. IMy only problem was that they didn't have the hot tub that Hotels.com had listed. Otherwise, the place was clean, modern and convenient. The beds were really comfortable. The food in the restaurant not so much. We got a coupon for $7 off per person for breakfast but we waited over 40 minutes for our breakfast and when it did arrive it was cold."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,hotel room clean - beds comfy - advertised free wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi and when I went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked. Free breakfast was really bad.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The pool and hot tub area was wonderful!    The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them.  The fitness room was big and spacious.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,slept like a baby!!! :)
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We only stayed 2 nights to visit people we know in the area
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,This hotel was extremely clean and staff was excellent and friendly. Would highly recommend friends to stay here. Plan on returning. Hope it stays as is. There is nothing to improve. Even let your four-legged friends stay. Wonderful hotel and state!!!
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We only spent a night - got there late and left early morning. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. AC unit was very noisy.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We were spending only 1 night to help out with my Dad. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, Our room was on the first floor, which I normally do not like, was very spacious (desk, sitting chair, refrigerator, large TV King Bed). The bathroom had been refurbished with a nice vanity and new surround for tub and shower... More"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This hotel is great. My only negative review would be the comfort of the bed. I was very firm, so much that I couldn't get comfortable. Just not my preference. Pool us great, food in the restaurant is good. Staff is very friendly."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Staff very friendly.  Some areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not.  Room was clean but halls looked dated and worn.  I have not stayed in other hotels in area so I don'the have a basis for comparison.  Convenient to highway.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The pool and hot tub area was wonderful! The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them. The fitness room was big and spacious.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a $7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Great breakfast, clean room! Nice staff, friendly and helpful. Large, comfortable room."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Just a bad experience. Convenience is the only item this Hotel offers.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The hotel is great for a three star - best thing about it really is the staff - very helpful
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I'm from the city and found it to be comfortable and quiet-- my friend is from the country and was bothered by the lights from the outside and the late-night chatter of guests next door.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was fine overall, but when I grabbed the last bath towel I found it to be of rag quality. It was literally frayed on the end and you could see thin patches when the towel was held up. For $100 per night, I would expect better quality. The hotel room was neat and clean and staff was friendly. I would stay again, but check the towels before I needed to use one! Nice pool and hot tub area."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We have stayed here on two different occasions and could not be happier. Very clean !!! Staff pleasant and helpful. Includes a real breakfast at a real restaurant on site. We love that! And husband with back issues really likes the salt water pool and hot tub. I go for the treadmill. Overall we look forward to staying at Best...Dear E5985FNmarye - Thank you for the taking the time to write this awesome review! We're happy you enjoyed your time with us, and look forward to having you back to rest and relax with us again soon!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until @6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,staff very nice. clean place.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Very loud rowdy customers staff would not do anything about the frat like partying.  Pool was good, hot tub was disgusting.  I really do not have anything good to say about this hotel.  I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Excellent hotel. I was there for a conference and found it to be in a good central location. The room was very comfortable, clean and was the perfect spot to stay. I also enoyed having the restaurant/bar right in the hotel. I would happily stay here again."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The hotel was as good as it was advertised to be.  The attached restaurant was better than expected; the food was reasonably priced and of excellent quality.  Everyone was friendly and very helpful.  We would most definately stay here again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.  I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim.It was a good stay and I would stay there again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"overall an 8, breakfast was acceptable (better last few times before) upgraded cable service would make stay much better. matress on both double beds on third floor way too soft but had no problems with 1st ir second floors at earlier stays."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"There puddles located throughout the hotel that should have been vacuumed up but weren't. The pub furniture had seen better days. The restuarant had no heat one morning for breakfast. Nothing seemed to be working. This hotel needs a complete makeover. The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting. The vegitables were so mushy you couldn't pick them up with your fork. I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We will not be staying at this hotel again. Our room had no heat, the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was not very clean. We tried to go to the pool/hot tub but it was packed. There was a birthday party at the pool at 7:30 at night for a pre-teen boy. It was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible. Then to top it all off the bed was horribly uncomfortable."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get if from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / business's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - that's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy . Not a bad place.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We were in Waterville for our Colby reunion. Hotel was fine. Service was pretty slow in the hotel restaurant where we had our breakfast, but luckily we were not in a rush. Breakfast was fine, waitstaff pleasant."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The food at breakfast was good but we had to wait 40 minutes to get it because there was only one cook working.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing it's wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue.  As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno.  Would probably stay there again."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Typical, but clean and dog friendly room. Food and service at O'Brien's Restaurant and Pub was top notch! Sarah was a most pleasant and dedicated bar tender and server. Enjoyed our evening of food and conversation.Dear Sandbar16 - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We hope you'll be back with us again in the future. We'll be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at O'Brien's."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The Best Western Plus brand is consistently decent, and this hotel did not disappoint. It was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room- a huge plus!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The hotel was right off the highway but not so close as to experience traffic noises. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best. Great bed. Slept like a log and woke refreshed. We ate at the in hotel resteraunt and were extreemly pleased. overall A++

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,HVAC was a problem that cause not a good sleep Restaurant service was slow not attending properly (not good service for businessman )
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Room was really dry. And I got a rash from the salt water pool.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,goed
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We had a good time, restuarant inside the hotel is kind of pricey but besides that it was a good time."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Uninspiring and tired looking...I should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaper...and next to a Starbucks....
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We found this motel to be pleasant, clean and affordable. Very helpful staff. Attached Irish bar/restaurant we great. The breakfast voucher for the restaurant was a delightful surprise for a real breakfast. I would highly recommend this Best Western"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Ok place, needs some paint and new clean carpet. Stains on bed cover."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was under renovations when we got there, that would have been nice to know prior to booking, it just didn't look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also. Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating, it was convenient to have a full restaurant/pub in the hotel, for different optionsat breakfast, not just a continental breakfast bar. The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me (obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel) and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen, find and return them to me before I left (not an easy task to find one knife). All in all it was a nice stay, and I wouldn't mind returning, I would like to see the improvements."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"very convenient for over night stay right off the I 95. restaurant & pub in hotel, gas station across street and other fast food restaurant up the road and a few shopping stores."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice rooms. Very clean. Front staff was polite and courteous.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice and friendly staff
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel is in close proximity to Colby College Museum of Art (great collection of regional and international artists).

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,This hotel is used for Winter Romp each year . The cost is not too expensive . The room is a good size . There was two beds in the room. It is in good condition for the price we pay . There is lots of parking . Breakfast was included which was great . Will return again to thus...
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Hotel was good. Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm. Great job! However, I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurant...HORRIBLE service, so/so food quality. With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldn't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish. Pasta over cooked, chicken rubbery, even my 4 yr old wouldn't eat it. Good stay, but eat elsewhere."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Conveniently located, very efficient staff, reasonably priced."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown (by car) to Waterville. The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock. This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property. Terrible experience!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The hotel was okay the hotel was fine I must put a bunch of words in here to tell you simply that the hotel was okay.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Halls reeked of marijuana. Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental. They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay, the rooms were VERY clean, the staff courteous and the hospitality OUTSTANDING. Please post these comments, thanks. Joe"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night. Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable. The restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only people that ate there that evening (there seemed to be quite a few people in the bar end though), the waiter was very helpful, the food was average (burgers, sandwiches and fries). NB breakfast is not... More"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Excellent value, nice clean room , quiet, had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly.

Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in the area.Dear T2359WMstephenb - Thanks so much for the kind words! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area :)"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I had a wonderful time at the best Western. My kids loved the pool and jetted spa. The staff where friendly and helpful.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are ok, the facilities are ok, the staff is terrific. The staff is very friendly and service oriented, they are what keep us coming back. There is a pool and work out area. The restaurant could use some updating. The rooms were clean."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We had business to attend to in Waterville
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely disgusting! You could not pay me to stay here again. We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didn't get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didn't work..it was just bad all the way around!! I wasn't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top (third) floor. We enjoyed our breakfast and the allowance (14) given to cover breakfast. I definitely would consider staying at the Best Western Plus if I was staying in Waterville again.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"My family stayed at this hotel and had a great weekend. The pool was huge and my kids loved it. The restaurant gives you a hot breakfast, not a microwaved one and the rooms were very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I want to thank the staff for a fun weekend away!!!"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,I enjoyed having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the $14.00 breakfast voucher
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"Room, Pool and Restaurant were better than expected for a Best Western."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room was great! Lots of space, good full-length mirrors, and an excellent bed. The closet could have been better. It was very shallow and needed to be deeper for clothes to hang properly."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Hotel Room was clean and comfortable.  We would recommend. We stayed because we were visiting Thomas College.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in.  The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean.  Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services.  They said the housekeepers had all gone home.  The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day.  Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered.  We got our own flatware and coffee.  The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry.  I am allergic.  Had to send it back.  I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called.  Called corporate and they wanted to give me points.  Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.  The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Grand. It was an older hotel buy very comfortable, and the pool and the hot tub were clean.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice stop over hotel near some shops.   The hotel had a pool and hot tub but these could do with some work.   Had a nice friendly bar to relax in.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The room was very small, the cable was fuzzy and not HD, and all the doors stuck or were not properly fitted for the opening. This was a $90 room, not at $150 room. Way over priced for location and condition. Not what I would expect from Best Western."

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was adequate and met my basic needs. It met my expectations for this type of hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The TV was difficult to use - you couldn't get directly to a specific channel and it didn't have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldn't really call it a continental breakfast."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Great place to stay when visiting your child at Colby! The hotel is convenient to campus. Rooms are good - beds are comfortable. Breakfast is good. Fitness center looks decent. We will stay there again when visiting Colby.
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"This place was right off the highway, but not too noisy. The rooms were spacious and clean. There was a pool and exercise room.

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"one handicap parking spot per entrance , broken bed, not handicap friendly. internet never worked over two days. Told front desk I couldn't walk far so I need something close to the exit they put me as far away as they could,"
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service.  Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet.  The internet speed was good as well."
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Nice and friendly staff

Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,It ws just an over night but very good accommodations
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,We have stayed at this Best Western several times. The rooms are clean. The staff is courteous and helpful and the breakfast is decent. It is very close to the highway but we never heard the traffic. Worth the money
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,"The hotel was excellent in all aspects. Lobby was warm and friendly, staff was knowledgeable. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. My one night stay was outstanding. The location of this best western was right off the interstate highway with plenty of restaurants to choose from. It also had it's own restaurant."

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Our stay was very short-only one night. Overall it was a good experience. The staff was friendly and it was nice to have breakfast before hitting the road again. Only downside was the pool renovation.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Wish the pool was a little bigger. It was always too full for us to enjoy it.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"would have wanted a comfortable chair to watch tv,etc"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,First of all the noise( very loud bass ) at night from other rooms and and management said the room had right to have music loud after 10:00 PM. I had attitude The best thing about the hotel was the views from my room of the ocean. And the convenience of parking my vehicle.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I came to meet a friend I've worked with for years via telecommunications. The staff were friendly and cooperative and courteous. The hotel was immaculate. The parking lot well lit. My room overlooking the ocean was perfect.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Stayed during the Christmas holiday. We had 80 degree, sunny gorgeous weather. Great location - oceanfront on the north end of the boardwalk.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Room was clean it served its purpose. I expected better for the price in comfort. The bed wasn't very comfy and needed 10 pillows to feel comfy.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Breakfast was a nightmare, all three days. Came down around 7:30am the first morning and there was nothing left and waited around 20 minutes for more food but got tired of waiting and had to eat out. Second day came down at 6:30am and again same situation. I asked the personnel but had an attitude so third morning decided not even to try it and went straight to the restaurant where ate the previous two mornings."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The hotel was nice and clean. The breakfast was ok but it was free. It was a great location for restaurants, shops and the convention center. I would stay here again."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We stayed here for Shamrock Marathon weekend. Location was perfect to finish line and view was amazing. Breakfast is free and delicious, be sure to say hi to Linda in the breakfast area-super sweet nice lady! Staff was helpful and accommodating. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Plan to stay here again next year!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Morning staff at breakfast were not very social except for Lynda. She worked one morning we were there and an absolute blessing to us! Need more like her. would be nice if motels would give you a discount for beach umbrella/chair rentals. And if there were more walkways to the beach off the Boardwalk so you didn't have to walk so far in the sand ! Think we saw only 4. Would make it easier especially w/ handicap child that has trouble walking. Very friendly staff and helpful. Great location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,If we have a choice we always choose Hampton Inn. We like the consistency and standard.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Went to Hampton Inn to celebrate our 50th anniversary but didn't plan on the weather being so bad. The restaurant had great food. Hope to return in the future and hope weather is better.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My wife and i stayed at Hampton Inn- Va Beach for our anniversary. It was very comfortable, had everything you could ask for and was nearby everything."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We stayed from October 10 to October 16. Great staff very helpful. Nice room. The vent in the bathroom didn't work well at all. Sticky stuff under the tv stand and on drawer handles. Guests in the next room kept me from sleeping one night. After a couple calls to the front desk the guests finally got quiet. Great breakfast with eggs,sausage,waffles, plenty to eat. Great location."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The noise level was out of this world and we were there for a quiet weekend. There were 2 big events going on in VA Beach that weekend and they both involved kids. They ran out of breakfast items in the mornings because they didn't properly prepare for the vast amount of kids.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"breakfast poor!. We stayed at the Hampton in Carlisle pa prior to this stay,YOU need to check out there breakfast! It was the best ever. front desk staff"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,my wife and i were very pleased with our stay the room was very clean and the free breakfast every day was great not just your typical continental breakfast. we definetely would stay at this hotel the next time we come here.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We enjoyed our stay here very much. Fantastic location, great views. Room very clean. Desk was accommodating with a late checkout. Linda, in the breakfast station is a ray of sunshine. Would definitely stay here again."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"This is an older property that is located on the boardwalk next to the 31st St. park near the statue of King Neptune.

The carpet could use a good steam cleaning (white... More"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"This hotel is in a pretty good location. If there is an event at Neptune Park and you don't like crowds, you might not be a happy camper.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Floor needed vacuuming and bed was awful.... so soft it basically collapsed when we laid down on it..... breakfast very mediocre. Not up to usual Hampton Inn standards....
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Really enjoyed the view! Lots of great restaurants nearby. The breakfast was great and always hot. The waffles were a hit with the kids! Linda made our morning! She was always attentive and made sure everyone was comfortable. The laundry facilities while convenient, need to be updated. Washer and dryers were old and rusty!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Everyone was so nice, I never saw so many smiles on a staff... I love the fact that the pool didn't close so I could swim as much as I wanted!!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Had many loud noises but maintenance was there working to correct it the next morning
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We had a lovely time. The breakfast was so wonderful due to Linda who appears to be there every morning... She was lovely
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We have stayed here few times before with good experience. Staff was great, the room was clean, hotel shows wear for age. There were some security issues this time as there were persons sleeping in the restaurant 2 mornings that had to be escorted out. We found the hallways to have debris that should have been cleaned up with housekeeping and was not. Few cars were double parked behind guests because they were using the beach access and nothing was done until end of day. There were no cameras and we saw people lingering in halls. We heard it was Beach week which sometimes has issues. Will not stay here again."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Pool was very dirty. Rooms weren't well vacuumed. Breakfast staff was excellent.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Hotel Staff was so welcoming and friendly. Any thing we needed it came to us quickly. The Hot Breakfast was great and really saved us time and money. My girls loved that the pool was open 24/7. They were able to swim even though we came back to the hotel so late. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,the breakfast is really bad!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Clean,comfortable,right sized to be friendly,centrally located. Great view of ocean,clean beach. Breakfast buffet was good with a variety. Convenient parking. Would stay again. Trip advisor should not require a minimum character number in this box."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The Hotel Staff were very helpful and cheerful and we were very happy with them. The only disappointment we had was with the Breakfast Buffet itself. We were late getting there the first morning and was told they weren't going to put out anymore food. But then we saw them put out more food for the employees to have breakfast. The second morning, there were no hasbrowns, bacon , or link sausage put on the buffet. We have stayed at this very hotel quite a few times and the buffet was always wonderful. I don't know if they have changed kitchen management but I was not happy with the changes or the kitchen managers attitude at all. I found it offensive. Since the breakfast buffet was the deciding factor in picking this hotel on this trip, I may have to rethink where we stay the next time."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Good place to stay. Wifi is sporadic and slow.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We've been staying here at this location for years. Not a bad thing to say about it. I dont need fancy but I need clean. Every time I need a get away either by myself or with my family I chose this location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Price ..see comments above Better price, paid 1330.00 for 3 nights ...way too much"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We were not happy with our stay at the Hampton Inn this trip. We were on the ground floor which is next to to Virginia Beaches Boardwalk instead of a higher floor. In addition it was were the room cleaning people set up in the mornings so carts voices were outside our door first thing in the morning. When we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we couldn't move because that is where YOUR organization put us. The hotel was not full when we were there.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Free breakfast was very good. Fantastic location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Fam vacation.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My second time staying,wish i had more time to stay. i would ly stay again. I 've looked at prices during warmer month. Seems a little pricey. My first stay was in Oct.2015 than this stay on 1/26 had beautiful weather both times. boardwalk full of people enjoying the weather."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Family of 5, stayed 2 nights. Great location. Great Free Breakfast. Good indoor heated pool. Clean facility and courteous/helpful staff"

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Very relaxing getaway, close to many restaurants and activities. Right on the beach and boardwalk. Lots of shopping within walking distance."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn. The hotel staff was very friendly during check-in and at the hot breakfast. Our room had a great view of the beach and the hotel was close to shops and restaurants.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"If you're coming to Virginia Beach to enjoy the sun and sand I would highly recommend The Hampton Inn! They are oceanfront and have fridges and microwaves in the room, along with an indoor pool and workout room. Definitely plan to eat the complimentary breakfast- I recommend the waffles!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Great location. Great atmosphere. Everyone nice and helpful. We had trouble with guests in the next room screaming and partying. After the third call to the front desk it finally stopped. I dropped my house key on a balcony below ours and staff retrieved my keys, very nice of them to do. Breakfast was nice and warm, eggs, sausage, bagels,... More"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The hotel room has a beautiful view of the ocean, and is very convenient to board-walk and eateries. However, we were not impressed with the condition of the hotel in general. It's a bit outdated and could use some remodeling work. Room was fairly clean whe we arrived other than forgetting to pick up the cup of cig buts left on the balcony. Room service was also less to be desired. The made the bed and provided towels.....no sweeping or collecting garbage. We would not stay here when we return. I'd rather pay a little more for a Marriot or Sheraton ."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"I Stayed two nights on business. Was pleased with the facility, my room, and the wonderful view, until it was time to go to bed. I pulled down the sheets, and found the bedding to be soiled with makeup, crumbs, and hair. Clean and fresh bedding are a basic expectation, and this hotel failed to deliver upon that. I called...

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I went for my nephew wedding and decided to stay here and I'm glad I did. My son and I loved it. The ocean view was fabulous and I plan to go again for pleasure. The breakfast was great.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Arrived with bad weather but the stay ended up delightfully. I wish I had asked for king bed.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Family vacation and it was wonderful.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Quiet, Clean, and pleasant to the eye and ears. Can hear the Ocean waves from inside the hotel with the balcony door opened or no sound with the balcony door closed. Great winter price for a small summer taste. I will highly consider coming back for the summer. Great 1st impression."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We wanted a get away that would provide the right combination of relaxation and options of events. We also wanted to stay at a beachfront hotel. This hotel was able to guarantee all rooms above the 4th floor would have wonderful views of the beach from the balcony. That was a true statement. Hampton Hotel's are the gold standard in... More
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Wonderful vacation and an Awesome location. We enjoyed watching the ocean from the balcony and the Holiday Festival of Lights. The front desk staff was super friendly and the continental breakfast provided a great start to our day. The hostess on duty and very friendly and made sure you felt welcomed.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Room was great, we needed extra bed and they brought us a rollaway right away which was very comfortable by rollaway standards! Breakfast was good, coffee bar open 24 hrs was convenient and good, my kids loved the indoor pool which is always open. Definitely going to be staying here on my next trip to Va Beach."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Great location, all rooms have an ocean view. Great breakfast all though breakfast can be chaotic when the mass shows up (makes it tough on staff). Only let down was that the windows were dirty and should be cleaned Mir regularly. I would definitely return to this hotel."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My wife and I stayed here one not to celebrate our 25th anniversary, and we usually stay at Hampton Inn when we travel, due to their consistency from location to location. We weren't disappointed here. Although this is a remodel of an older hotel, it was very nicely done. The only thing that could be improved is the bed, as... More"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Linda the breakfast lady is incredible. She makes you smile from the time you walk into the breakfast area. The free breakfast is very good.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Cpuple's long weekend getaway. Very relaxing.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Noisy aircon 11am check-out time selection of breakfast too limited. Location and friendliness of staff. Great sea view.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"All staff from kitchen to cleaning and reception were EXCELLENT. The only person I didn't like from the staff was the female bartender, she seemed to be having a bad couple of days. Wasn't friendly taking orders, NEVER smiled, was no attemptive. I just didn't want to keep on ordering at the bar because she looked like she didn't want to be there. I noticed she was like that with everyone no just with me and my wife. I felt I was no welcome at the bar so decided to leave instead. I really loved this place. It is very clean and central to everything. The staff is very professional and friendly. Their complimentary breakfast is great and the staff assisting with breakfast are AWESOME. Their breakfast is really good with a variety for everyone and very clean. No need for going out for breakfast. The views from their rooms are fantastic."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Staff are friendly. Tip Olivia who worked at the breakfast station since she was very nice and happy to help. Room was small but clean. Pool and hot tub need a good clean up. A very nice quiet stay with the Christmas lights right outside of the balcony. Would come back again and hopeful they will jazz up the pool area
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,really nice place. on the beach. breakfast is free and the staff are friendly. a notch up from your regular hampton inn.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Second time here off season. Great all around spot.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"another reason to stay at this hampton: at&t wi-fi is one of the many great amenities for guests. look for the stayconnected program. it���s free, fast and easy to connect."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I stay at Hampton Inn's all the time and this was the dirtiest Hampton Inn I have ever seen. Carpets were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning. The elevators appeared to have not been cleaned in a very long time including the metal doors. The fitness room had empty cups and dirty towels laying around. Water cooler was... More
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Staff were awesome!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The room was ready early which was exciting. However I noticed the patio window had not been cleaned. The towels appeared laundered but strands of hair was found in at least one of them. I decided not to use any. The room had a couple fruit flies. The desk attendant allowed a guest to bring pet (chihuahua) which was not a service dog.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We loved the location and the staff was very friendly and helpful!!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The room was very clean and the staff was amazing, they welcomed my husband home I thought that was very thoughtful of the staff! Very quiet and a beautiful view woke up the next morning to dolphins swimming in the ocean!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The staff is amazing as is the immediate proximity of the beach andthe Board Walk. Everything is spotless and pleaseant. Breakfast very good as well. Love the bar and restaurant right on the Board Walk.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Great. We want to return soon.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Although the rooms may have been a touch dated they were very clean. Every room has an oceanfront view which is why you come to the beach! Location is on the main strip so convenient for tourists. Free breakfast in the morning is perfect to start the day.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"First of all I have to say that two people made this visit extraordinary.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Great hotel and location. Perfect to spend a weekend with friends
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We booked in for a night while travelling the US... The place had a great feel and our room was spacious... 801.. Top floor with a balcony. The ladies at relation were extremely motherly and friendly. We loved the place and extended our stay for another night! Can highly recommend this hotel!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,This property was very nice and at a great part of Virginia Beach. The room was well appointed and comfortable. The heater was a bit noisy but not bad enough to keep us up. The location to shops and restaurants is perfect and I am sure that this property is a blast during the summer.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Location, the best! Definitely prefer north end of Atlantic Ave of VA Beach. Less crowded, good restaurants, quieter, view is terrific! Linda and breakfast staff are so polite, friendly and efficient. Front desk staff just OK, elevator extremely slow, AC/heat much to loud (like the jets flying over until 10 pm)"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Room was comfortable and clean, the staff was extremely friendly, breakfast was well done. Pool was a great break during the winter and a real treat for the grandkids. Excellent experience. Would definitely do it again."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Stayed here with the family one night on our way through town. All the staff was friendly and professional. Breakfast variety was good, and good quality. Indoor pool was small, but good for a late evening swim with the kids. Only issue we had was with the heat/AC unit in the room. Unit was a little loud for the light sleepers and thermostat took a couple hours of trial and error to get the room comfortable."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"This hotel was definitely the most expensive and the worst of our trip. We visited about 10 different hotels in various cities. In this hotel we felt we've come to a nursing home rather than to a resort hotel. Furniture outdated, neglected elevators, the bathroom feels like it was untouched for many years, a sense of neglect throughout the hotel. We expected it to be the best hotel because they asked us for the highest price and it was a huge disappointment. nice location."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Two nights stay for business reasons in the area became a total refresher for this tired traveler. Heavenly views from the private balcony, extremely friendly staff, and a hot breakfast better than the usual Hampton Inns, just cooked with more care. The perfect beach location. Will return for pleasure with family and friends, for sure!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The beds were comfortable. Staff were very friendly especially Linda who worked the breakfast shift. Hotel restaurant was delicious and service was exceptional. The pool and hot tub area was clean and always had plenty of towels. My only critique would be that more options of breakfast meat should be available daily. One day was turkey sausage next day was pork sausage. I think both should be served daily. My family and I would stay at this hotel again.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Second time staying here and not disappointed. Location wise the hotel cannot be faulted. The accommodation is good, the air conditioner was a little noise. Not enough to make a fuss over. The staff are a great bunch of people, always friendly and helpful."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The free WiFi didn't work very well. It was disappointing considering I have teens. The staff was very friendly. The location was perfect! We truly enjoyed our visit.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Nice hotel. Room was clean and staff were very helpful. Beautiful view of the lights along the beach. Boardwalk and bike path are closed to walkers during these hours.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The washing machine was too old and didn't feel clean the cloths.the carpet wasn't vacuum every day . I like the breakfast. Love the view. And it was easy check in and out.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The staff at this Hampton are the best that I've encountered in a long time...which is pretty amazing considering the fact that I mostly stay in Hamptons, Hiltons, and Doubletrees and I find that the staff in Hilton brand properties nearly always exceed my expectations.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Very friendly staff, helpful in all aspects. Ocean front great view"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Rooms not as sound proof as we would like- we heard a lot of doors slamming shut and people in hallway- light from hall shines in a all around the door at night. We loved our ocean front view! The ocean waves lull you to sleep- the beds were very comfortable with lots of fluffy pillows- bathroom spacious and everything was very clean. Beautifully decorated- staff courteous and we loved the breakfast! Healthy assortments of fruit, cereal, oatmeal, cheese omelet, sausage, yogurt, assorted Danishes, muffins, and bagels- you can also enjoy the beautiful ocean view while eating breakfast! Beach very clean- overall a fantastic short getaway- highly recommend the Hampton Inn! We hope to return again in the future, and will definately stay here!:-)"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We picked this hotel because it was our 4th time in VA and had always recieved great service. Well this was the last time we will stay here. They gave us a tiny room with no shower which I specifically needed accommodations for my son and was denyed because they claimed the hotel was completely booked all week (we booked in April). The on duty manager claimed she would keep us on a list even if no room became available, there was never an attempt to reach out and apologize or try to accommodate us in anyway. Her response was we can move you to a ground room at a higher rate... Really We didn't screw up you did. Our room was always cleaned after 3pm accept for one day where the house cleaner was amazing! Overall we were very disappointed and displeased with this stay. Over the years we have recommended and traveled with several families to this hotel..not anymore."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,My wife and I stayed here for several days and had a wonderful time. Room was clean and we had a very nice view of the ocean and beach.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Great hotel location, amenities and room! I would strongly recommend this hotel!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"I genuinely had no complaints while staying here, other than the young kids in the pool/spa area. The parents didn't really watch, and no staff were supervising the area to give reminders about horseplay, diving, etc, so adults were splashed and crowded at times. Everything! Breakfast was great, the beds were comfortable, and our room overlooked the beach (literally steps away). The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean. Despite being on the beach, there was no musty smell or sand in the rooms. Our balconies were great and gave us a free first class seat to the fireworks show just a few hundred yards from the hotel. Definitely recommend this place!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Very nice, clean room, bottle owone in room as asked. Price was great for January, only thing if your staying for a romantic getaway this one restaurant not the greatest for dinner but breakfast was great. So was the employees!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Had a great time. My fiance' and I stayed here New Years Eve. He proposed to me here. I love the view from the balcony, and the sounds of the water. Room was clean. I plan to go back soon! Great breakfast!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"I didn't like that the bed linens were all one piece and didn't tuck in. I felt like I was trying to stay covered all night. I feel like the thermostat had a motion detector on it and room seemed hot at night. Also, my son forgot his ipod and I called a couple of times to see if it was turned in and it would have been nice if someone would've offered to take my number and maybe give an extra look in the room for me. Made me feel hopeless. Mostly everything."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Great location, really friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was good as well, and parking very convenient. We will stay here again!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Room was spotless. Staff so professional. Right on the beach. Boardwalk right at the back of hotel. Ocean view. Balcony. Starbucks next door. Great breakfast. Coffee. Bar downstairs. Quiet.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Considering the current rating on TripAdvisor, we thought this Hampton would be more pristine. House Cleaning did kindly help us with a couple of issues. We have stayed in nicer Hampton's than this. However, considering the beachfront location, I'm sure it has a huge customer turnover. The value for a winter stay was fairly good considering that's it's right on... More"

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"There isn't much to say. Average free breakfast, room clean, great location and easy parking. Pool and spa working. Staff--except for one young fellow with a charming smile--just didn't seem all that friendly or welcoming. A first I've found with a Hampton."

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,no comfortable furniture in lobby to sit on to read when you wake up in the middle of the night and don't want to wake up the other person in your room! That it was clean and right on the beach! The restaurant in the hotel was actually pretty good. Would eat there again.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Everything was great except the pool. has always been my favorite pool in the area, but needs some attention. Was not very clean around the sides had some green mold. Also the sand should be cleaned out off and on, which was not done the entire week we were there. The pool should be closed at least twice a week for cleaning, it is open 24-7. The first day I reported to the desk some smiley stuff floating on the surface and they did seam to address that quickly and seamed better the next day however i am not sure i would use the pool again unless the cleanliness is addressed better."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"There was a pair of someone else's panties in the bed when we arrived, our reservation was not correct.

The noise level was low, the... More"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The room was not as clean as we remembered from a previous stay. We found someone else's cup left on the floor under the bathroom shelf. The windows hadn't been cleaned in months. The patio still had beach sand from the summer. Our stay was in December! Hope they can find a way to inspire housekeeping to do a better job or we will have to find another hotel to stay in. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Enjoyed the hot cider and cookies in the evening. Loved driving along the boardwalk to see the Christmas lights.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I had a very nice stay in Virginia Beach on a recent business trip. The hotel restaurant had a great dinner. The staff were all very friendly. Breakfast was a bit mediocre in comparison to the rest of the facility. Right smack on the beach!

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We always stay here on our way to NC. We also highly recommend the Terrapin restaurant 3102 Holly Road. Expensive but GREAT A great place to stay and relax in your travels, right on the boardwalk, super at Christmas time with the Holiday lights set up."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Unfortunately this was the dirtiest Hampton Inn we were in after 3 weeks of traveling. Very friendly staff. Hotel is located right at the beach and in the center of the Promenade. We had a beautiful view over the ocean from our room's balcony.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My family stays here every summer. It's always clean and the oceanfront view can not be beat. Breakfast is free, which is a treat. Hang out on your balcony or walk next door to the King Neptune sculpture to hear live music at King Neptune Park. There's even a playground for the kids."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't speak for the food or bar. The room was clean, adequate space, adequately appointed and stocked, everything worked, the staff was totally friendly and polite, helped whenever we asked. Couldn't ask for more. The decor is a bit dated, but just fine. Honestly it was a great deal. We stayed 3 nights over Valentine's Day weekend. Bed was comfy, plenty of pillows, nice duvet and an extra blanket in the closet. We were comfy and warm, in spite of record breaking cold outside. I had a delivery come for my husband and asked it be put in our room while we were out. I returned to it setting on the desk in the room. Well done Hampton Inn."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We didn't have a bad experience, but there were a few areas they could improve on. We had a balcony which the chairs were dirty and the railing was also. The windows were never cleaned which effected our view. In the morning when we had breakfast we had to listen to a worker who would sing very loud religious songs which was not appropriate. However over all we did enjoy our stay."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My husband and I have taken multiple weekend getaways to this hotel and absolutely love it. We splurge on the room with the jacuzzi tub. There are great views and it's always been a wonderfully relaxing experience! We recently moved away, but I know for sure that if/when we visit the area again, we'll be staying here!!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I really enjoyed our stay here up until check out. Great location friendly staff large room and bathroom. Unfortunately the hotel could only give us a late check out of noon after running in the morning Shamrock race and with the roads scheduled to be closed until 1pm.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The management- they did not speak very highly of Booking.com and blamed Booking.com for Hampton Inn's mistake in charging my credit card 2 times! I am a manager myself and have been in the hotel/travel industry for almost 20 years. This is NOT how you win travelers over! All rooms are oceanfront.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,So convient gas station and ice cram parlor across the street

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,It was very difficult to regulate the air in the room - it was either too cold or too hot as soon as the ac changes to auto. The location is excellent.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"I specifically requested a room for 5 adults, I was given a room that was nothing like the room I reviewed on line, except for the two queen beds. We didn't have enough room to unfold the folding bed, the hotel manager on duty did nothing to try and accommodate us, except to agree that the on line photos needed to be updated. This was our first time at Hampton inn and our last time. Hampton Inn did serve a good breakfast and the other hotel workers were courteous and customer friendly."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Had family vacationing at the Ocean Front so I did a staycation with them. Many of us local avoid the main sections of the strip in the summer because of the crowds.

I would definitely stay here again."

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Not bad but pricey. Enjoyed our stay due to its location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The rooms could use a little sprucing up here or there but nothing major. Maybe repaint some walls and upgrade some bathroom fixtures. The hallways and elevator were less air conditioned than the rooms. But honestly the pros outweighed all of thus. The free breakfast was great and helped us save money on the trip. The location was excellent. Close to everything and a spectacular view. The beds were comfortable. My husband has back problems abd they helped him to rest. The cleaning staff was great!

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The Hampton Inn ocean front north is a jewel. Prime location, excellent location, great view, Came down for an extended stay for medical treatment. Business center computers would not let me access my email. Will have to cut trip short because of this."

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Location of this hotel is great and as advertised is right on the beach.

Room was pretty much what you would expect, 2 queen beds, a nice... More"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"This hotel is in a great location. The inside pool was small and people used it to wash the sand off themselves and boogie boards from the beach. Pool was not heated. Staff was polite and rooms were clean and comfortable but for the price we paid, the hotel itself was disappointing. Plastic chairs and tables to eat on outside when other local hotels he beautiful outdoor furniture. Restaurant was very good and prices comparable. Would not stay here again as other hotels cost the same and are much nicer!!!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Stayed one night in November, and really enjoyed it. The staff at the front desk was friendly and very helpful.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Everything was wonderful. I only regret not getting a second night. I was so please that I wanted to add another room and another night to bring my children. The restaurant downstairs was ok but the beach lemon dessert with ice cream was really good!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Great stay at a great value. Too bad tha bar and restaurant were closed for winter but the breakfast was delicious as only Hampton Inn can provide. All rooms are ocean view and free parking was an added perk
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"the coffee didn't taste fresh at breakfast. Ms. Linda the breakfast attendant was amazing. She was always cleaning up after us and extremely friendly. Also the 5th floor housekeeping supervisor was excellent. Always checking to see if we needed anything for the room, clean towels, or our bedding changed."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Staff was great. Location to everything was very helpful. Access to beach, boardwalk and restaurants we liked was perfect. Even the teenagers had a great time."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Hotel a bit dated. Exercise room wasn't functional. Dining room experience very poor. Beds , linens and towels excessively worn. I realize it is a vacation destination and gets higher than normal wear and tear, but overall , it did not meet my prior experiences with the Hampton Brand."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Few fixes with frig having a little smell, the door sticking, the sheets had 2 or 3 stains on them (clean but old, washed stains). Service staff was kind and tentative. Location great."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,People in room adjacent to mine were out on pation all night talking loudly / partying- dispite repeated calls to front desk nothing was done to silence - I was unable to get any rest and had early morning meetings.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The free breakfast was not the best but there was more than enough to eat, it just didn't taste the best. Room was very clean and view of the ocean. I would stay here again"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Extremely clean rooms. Hotel staff very kind and accommodating. Excellent complimentary breakfast. Problems with Cable TV but fixed immediately after reported to front desk. Pool area was horrible due to children unsupervised and extreme noise level in that area.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The hallway could be at least vacuumed.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The room was very nice and the bed quite comfortable. The restaurant/bar had a limited menu and the food was not the best. There didn't seem to be enough wait staff, service was slow and non-attentive."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We stay here every year and participate in the Shamrock marathon events. The staff are amazing, the rooms are so clean and the location is perfect. The food in the restaurant is really good and reasonably priced. Which is important when you are too sore to go very far for food. The service was great. I definitely recommend."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Linda that worked breakfast was a delight!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Front desk wasn't that helpful. Price was high for such a late check-in time. Bar would not serve us anything until after 4pm. We were told there was a private party so we were not able to order anything until after 4pm. We didn't see a party going on. Location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The only thing I disliked was that the hallways and elevators were hot and muggy and I feel awful for the staff that have to endure that. We loved the staff, they were so nice and helpful.They had our room ready 2 hours before check-in. The breakfast was delicious, we especially liked that they changed it up daily. The room was nice, I liked the bathroom size and the shower. The beds are so comfortable."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,We had a relaxing time on the beach staying at the Hampton. Linda was a joy to see every morning in the breakfast area. Her friendly greeting and helpful nature made breakfast enjoyable. Thank you Linda! The access to the ocean and the boardwalk was amazing. Walking out the patio door every morning to watch the sunrise was wonderful. We would definitely stay here again!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Great beachfront hotel with great bar area and restaurant. Rodney in the bar with superior!! Breakfast was great. The room clean and bed very comfortable. Staff was helpful with suggestions for great seafood.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Need a little more work on the pancakes. The overall stay was good.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The room and amenities were much nicer than I expected! I typically stay at Hilton Gardens but my tennis team insisted on Hampton Inn. Great view too. I will not think twice about booking a room there when my daughter and her husband return to the nearby naval station.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,It was overall ok. The pros: The location was perfect right on the beach next to all the entertainment and restaurants. Free breakfast with a descent selection. . The cons: The only pool this hotel had was indoor! It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel. We figured we had the beach so the pool was not a factor. But we went with kids and the beach can be exhausting! Also the elevator and hallways were so hot no AC in those areas.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Great location right next to the King Neptune statue and Park. Hotel staff was great and even was able to accommodate an early check in. Food was reasonably priced and great drink specials. This was a very desirable north side location.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We stay at this conveniently located hotel several times a year. The experience is always consistently good. We enjoy the location to great restaurants, grocery stores, and the beach! The facility is clean, the people are friendly, and the breakfast is always good."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,No dislikes! The friendliness of the staff!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,For our family of 5 it turned out to be good. The only thing that I wise was different was the fact that we needed to have a roll-a-way bed and it made the room very snug. But the hotel did accommodate us for this added bed.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"I arranged for my family to visit me in VB for the Thanksgiving Holiday. The Hotel and Staff was excellent. The Breakfast Buffet was horrible. As a HILTON honors member over the years, my family and I have enjoyed the food at every HILTON PROPERTY that offered meals. The breakfast food at this location was the worst.

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"We usually stay at the Hilton next door but couldn't get an oceanfront room, so we tried the Hampton.

It had a kitchenette area, and we used... More"

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"See above More hangers in closet , we were three adults Good selection at breakfast No night housekeeping. Room next to elevator had food trash out in hall way from early evening until next day... Not very pleasant to see every time we used elevator"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The bed and pillows were terrible. The property was old and didn't feel clean at all. We tried the Hot Tube one evening and it was so hot we couldn't even get in and hardly had any jet action anyway. No one at the front desk seemed concerned about this. It was right on the beach and we had free parking.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Price We loved everything about the hampton inn. Just wish it didn't cost so much per night or we would have stayed longer. I had read about Linda the breakfast lady and so glad we had a chance to meet her. She is a gem and brings a smile to all she meets every morning. She should have a raise whatever she makes for sure. People like that are worth their weight in gold!

Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Lobby, hallways, and elevators were very warm and humid. Fortunately our room was not. Our key card did not work for the pool. We were able to get in, but this problem was never fixed. Also, we were locked out of our room on our last day before check out time. Luckily there was a maid nearby to let us back in. Not horrible, but certainly annoying. Breakfast was good, wonderful view, great location. Overall, a good experience."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"the breakfast is free and just your normal hampton inn breakfast. i don't know what the others were expecting, but don't skip it! there's something for everyone."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,My husband and I wanted an overnight get away to recharge. The hotel was nice. Our room was clean and spacious. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant.

Pool water temp. ws perfect but pool could have been cleaned overnight to remove sand etc...for early a.m. users Meals were all good Staff ws helpful pleasant and attentive whenever there ws an issue in the room.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Housekeeping didn't stop by until after 3p.m. I stay at a lot of hotels so this was a little out of the norm for me. However, when I spoke with the staff they stopped by earlier. Only meat served for breakfast was pork. So I kinda skipped breakfast Great location. Comfortable room and bed. Unbelievably quiet for midsummer.Would stay again and would recommend this hotel to friends and family."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"No complaints, I would stay again The breaks was good, hot, and a variety. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. Even saw dolphins while having breakfast ."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"My only complaint was the last day we were there, the pool was closed most of the evening into early nighttime for cleaning. I appreciate the cleaning but thought maybe clean it at a different time knowing it's too cold to be outside, my kids didn't get to swim. It was still a great place to stay!! I will most definitely be looking up Hampton Inn for future travels!! Staff was so fabulous and kind!! Our room felt clean and was so welcoming. Continental breakfast was hands down, the best I have ever seen!! Any breakfast food you would want!!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The only thing I did not like is that I was not able to stay longer. Very pleasant experience. The room was clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed our view and the breakfast was awesome!
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Stay was wonderful. Weather wasn't great but still had a great time
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Breakfast food choices Perfect location
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The jacuzzi tub was dirty Rather have had a hot breakfast instead of continental The location and the rate Like that the pool and jacuzzi was available for 24hrs Great view of the ocean
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Pillows were not good. The hostes / server in the breakfast was phenomenal. She has a great spirit and very customer friendly. Alluring personality.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,The complimentary breakfast was a fancy continental breakfast. Make your own waffles and frozen western omelets. The way they advertised it i thought it would be a great breakfast. Had i known i would have booked a room somewhere else with a nice breakfast. For the price it was disappointing. Restaurant and bar were great and convenient being right down stairs.
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Our 2 nights here were a last minute add on to our vacation to spend more time in the ocean and we loved it
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The hotel holds it's promises and is clean and family oriented. Staff is attentive. Breakfast could see some more choices and changes, but overall ok. We liked the location in the heart of everything, even though February might not neccessarily be the best month to travel to Virginia Beach: many stores and restaurants are closed."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The bathroom needed a little more work. The bathroom had less than 1/2 roll of toilet paper and they didn't stock it with another roll. We went down to the front desk and got another no problems. There was hair and a dead moth on the bathroom floor along with some black looking crumbs and lots of sand still in the tub. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were nice and clean. We had a huge balcony with great views. My children loved watching the wild Dolphins swim from our room. I love that this hotel is close to the center of the boardwalk so you have many options to dine and shop. Free breakfast was amazing!.Even with many people gathering at breakfast, there were many options and the staff were really friendly and kept everything clean and well stocked. Overall the staff that we met really seemed to enjoy and take pride in their job, they gave me the feeling that they cared about us which makes this an awesome place to stay!"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"The staff were wonderful and so pleasant to work with. The rooms were great, clean with the best ocean views. So many shops and places in easy walking distance. Breakfast selections was good and the staff there make starting your day a great pleasure. The pool and grounds are well kept."

The bed was very comfortable and smelled like fresh linens .Reminded me of being home .Staff was pleasant and friendly! Room was very clean.Breakfast was good and enjoyed Ms.Linda's smile and personality,she took good care of the tables..."
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,"Tried getting an early start on the summer by taking advantage of lower rates. The Hampton Inn (north) was an ideal choice. Just steps away from Neptune's iconic image, good restaurants, and shops, one couldn't ask for a better location. We had a room on the top floor with a jacuzzi which added to our delightful stay. The complementary breakfast...Thank you for the great review! We'll be sure to pass your kind comments along to Linda, Jackie, and Jenn. We appreciate the feedback and look forward to your next visit! Brittney B. Senior Sales Manager"
Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,I'd skip the breakfast.
Comfort Suites,"Went to morning breakfast buffet once. The food was just basic: rubbery eggs and leathery sausage. Locals seemed to be just walking in off the street filling plates up with food and then walking out. They diid not look like hotel guests. Checked out at 4:00 a.m. to catch an early flight. Homeless-looking man was sleeping in one of the chairs in the lobby. Asked the clerk who he was, she said he was somebody waiting for a ride. Kind of spooky."
Comfort Suites,I won't be staying there again. Only needed to rest for 6 hours before heading back home or else I would have checked out.
Comfort Suites,"The staff was very friendly and there were plenty of options for breakfast. Unfortunately, our bed was extremely uncomfortable, the hot tub didn't work properly, and the pool was pretty murky."
Comfort Suites,My stay was ok I didn't know that on the weekends the hotel becomes a free for all. Next time I think I will stay at the Westin.
Comfort Suites,"I stayed there 6 days. This experience was okay. I've stayed at better places! The breakfast was okay. The rooms were okay they could use a deep cleaning. Plus there is this smell-not unpleasant-but definitely self imposed by the hotel to cover up the former smoking days. The Internet was very slow at times. It stormed one night and the power went out, when the power came back on I had no tv. I called front desk and they told me to keep cutting the tv on and off until it started working. Needless to say, I had no tv until the next day!"
Comfort Suites,"This was our second time staying there and I can't say enough good about it. Everything was wonderful from the checking in, to the room, to the breakfast, to the easy checkout! We will definitely stay there again! Wonderful employees!"
Comfort Suites,This was my first stay at this hotel and I would highly recommend it.
Comfort Suites,Staff was very helpful. Hotel was clean. we had to call the front desk for a issuse with our safe and they were at our door in seconds.
Comfort Suites,Large rooms with comfortable bedding!
Comfort Suites,"I was very impressed with the room size, condition of the property, free breakfast, and service."
Comfort Suites,Can't complain its was nice
Comfort Suites,rest room was dirty
Comfort Suites,Very nice I enjoyed the room will book again
Comfort Suites,"Room housekeeping needs to improve. Dirty pillowcase, blankets, and decorations"
Comfort Suites,"Very comfortable and clean hotel. Staff was very helpful and courteous. I arrived late and had to get up very early so when the smoke alarm kept beeping periodically, I let it go, seemed like more trouble than having them fix it or worse, moving rooms at 1am. I did tell the manager the next morning and he apologized and I am quite sure if I had chosen to call the desk they would have gotten right on it. He assured me that it would be taken care of so the next guest would not hear that."
Comfort Suites,"I went to Detroit/Southfield for a funeral. I chose this hotel because it is a block from the funeral home,it was a good choice - quite,clean, and excellent breakfast and staff. They even printed a map for me."
Comfort Suites,"The comforter had red and pink stains on it. I was disgusted. We stayed here because of a power outage in our neighborhood, the next morning while checking out and getting ready to leave for work, the Front desk person made us wait while they went to check our room out, which made me late for work. I've never experienced that before."
Comfort Suites,"It was really so so. The suites are really just large open rooms. The furniture is dated. If you go through hotels.com and not The hotel they don't really care about fixing any issue, but the do it politely"
Comfort Suites,The staff was friendly and the room was clean. Could hear some noise from other rooms and it is close to the highway so you had road noise. Breakfast could use some work.
Comfort Suites,Awesome! I plan on staying again!
Comfort Suites,"The hotel was nice overall. There was a lot of construction around, so it made it hard to find. It wasn't the cleanest room. I was asked if I wanted an accesible bathroom upon arrival.. which was weird. I said it didn't matter, but was given one (I'd think that they would reserve them for those who actually needed it). The tub was pretty gross."
Comfort Suites,"Stayed here and figured I would go to the hot tub during the 21+ hours. Got there and a bunch of 16 or 17 year olds, 'hanging around' and all stopped saying anything the moment I arrived. Saw a couple leave the bathroom together, and these teenage brats kept turning off the jets in the hot tub. They weren't in it, but enjoyed being rude. When the two came out, they just left the hotel. So, they were not even guests of the hotel, being rude, hanging out, up to no good, and I was just shocked at the lack of control the hotel staff had of the situation. Don't think I will return. Look like it is going down hill there, in my opinion, which is a shame because I have stayed there many times in the past."
Comfort Suites,Wonderful
Comfort Suites,"Hotel was nice. Very clean. Had a jetted tub king sized room. Room was very nice. Tub was a little small, but still nice."
Comfort Suites,great!
Comfort Suites,Manager was dismissive when talking to regarding errors in room selection.
Comfort Suites,it was great no complaints
Comfort Suites,The stay was pleasant and comfortable
Comfort Suites,"The people upstairs was noise and jumping up and down. I call the desk to complain they said the would talk with to them, I ask to be moved, but the said we will first talk with them. Found desk call back and said they were getting ready for bed this was 8:30 it was 2:00am when the went to sleep. So I had a mad night."
Comfort Suites,"Everything was great, the bed, pillows, space, friendliness. The breakfast was something to come back for as well!"
Comfort Suites,We enjoyed stay front desk very helpful..
Comfort Suites,Very comfortable bed and spacious room. The jetted tub was a nice feature for relaxation. Everything was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Although I did not use the pool area it's nice to have the indoor pool and hot tub option. A delicious free breakfast is included. It's nice to have a completely smoke free environment.
Comfort Suites,Came in for an event and the room was comfortable the staff was very friendly and very helpful would recommend to family and friends.
Comfort Suites,"We were in town for a concert. Quiet room, very clean and a great pool area. Everything was nicely maintained and the complimentary breakfast went beyond expectation."
Comfort Suites,I really enjoyed this hotel the staff was very friendly and the rooms was very nice
Comfort Suites,The hotel was good for a short stay. Right on the freeway for easy access to almost anywhere. It was quiet and clean.
Comfort Suites,Overall better than what I expected
Comfort Suites,"Was what I needed for this trip. Very close to family. Needed the sofa bed and it was in room when I arrived. Most of all i had a quiet night sleep, unlike the last stay at this hotel."
Comfort Suites,"Nice, clean and quiet!!!!"
Comfort Suites,The bathroom had mold on the ceiling above the tub. I noticed on the day of checkout. The buffet was good and the staff went out of their way to help me find a taxi to where I was going.
Comfort Suites,Was extremely noisy on the floor above and so was difficult to sleep.
Comfort Suites,Gathered family from around the country for wedding(5 rooms). Front desk went out of their way to make our stay nearly perfect. Large lobby area and dining room was great for us all to gather.
Comfort Suites,Great hotel with fresh cookies free breakfasts very big room with jacuzzi tub in middle of room so great romantic getaway
Comfort Suites,"The staff all seem to be unhappy working there, they move very slowly, the check-in process took a long time because the clerk couldn't figure out the computer system, and switched between two computers numerous times. The breakfast is average, and the food area wasn't very clean. The entire place feels low energy, but our room was fine and as advertised."
Comfort Suites,The stay was very nice and peaceful.
Comfort Suites,I love the upgrade the hotel! We had a great time!! I will most definitely come back again.
Comfort Suites,"We were staying there while they refinished our hardwood floors, so for the price, location, and amenities, it was worth it. They need to do some updates with the sleeper-sofas and lobby, hallway areas."
Comfort Suites,Awesome hotel to stay
Comfort Suites,It was a nice stay
Comfort Suites,Nice Quiet And Comfortable Atmosphere
Comfort Suites,"close to business, easy access in and out - only one overnight"
Comfort Suites,it was great
Comfort Suites,"Polite staff, very clean and quiet hotel convenient to everything I needed to get to."
Comfort Suites,Great hotel. Would of been nicer if there were local restaurants within walking distance. Wendy's is your only choice
Comfort Suites,"Nice size room, clean and the hotel was easy to get to."
Comfort Suites,The rather large men walking around the grounds in T-shirts clearly marked security should have been a clue as well as the fact that the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff.
Comfort Suites,"Loved it, can't wait to stay again."
Comfort Suites,The front desk lady was great! We did get a phone call for running around from the room below us. It's 7:30am on a Monday. They are kids-get over it.
Comfort Suites,"The CS was the perfect place for the 7 of us too stay for the lions /Titan game ! The hotel staff were so friendly and showed hospitality southern style thank you for the smiling faces each morning at breakfast , we enjoyed the free breakfast, the hot tub and the fitness room! We will be back when we come up too visit family !!"
Comfort Suites,Excellent! Staff extremely friendly and courteous...
Comfort Suites,Good value for the money I would stay again.
Comfort Suites,"Our host was very helpful - we were very late, held up in rad construction. Our rental car wouldn't lock, and he fixed it! We were so grateful and the room was so comfortable, this was a most pleasant and restful stay"
Comfort Suites,Made coming for family reunion so much nicer. love the room.
Comfort Suites,The hotel is starting to show its age. Our tub was cracked and the floor under the tub was sinking. The carpeting seemed new. The pool water was cool and the room temp. was also cool. The breakfast was good and the lady taking care of it was helpful and friendly.
Comfort Suites,"We were on the 4th floor. The elevator was slow but there was an elevator!!! Our room was beautiful with large desk, loveseat, 2 cubes to sit on or use for coffee table. The bathroom was small but adequate. Very spacious room size and looks newly refinished."
Comfort Suites,Hotel was newly remodeled and in good shape. Bathroom tile was dingy and old. Comfortable bed. Couch was not comfortable but it was also a bed so I didn't expect much.
Comfort Suites,"I was on a get away. I first discovered hair from ones private parts, filthy conditions and then after that bugs every day. Three different types of bugs, extremely rude manager and desk clerks, black mold on the wall, crumbling drywall and paint all over the curtains, that were only partially hung up. Discovered this further into my stay whe I wanted some natural light. I had a feeling my stuff was being looked at, so I took pictures of how my bags looked when I left my last day, and to my surprise they weren't the same when I got back to the room. I was asked to leave my handicapped room, because someone else, a large party wanted it to be available if they needed the room. I had to inform the clerk that I am indeed handicapped. One clerk, spoke to me so rudely and put his hand up to me and said talk to the hand. This is not a place anyone should stay. I checked out a day before, I did not feel safe in that place."
Comfort Suites,"We came to this hotel from out of state to stay while we visited Cedarville College. What a pleasant surprise this hotel was! The room was bigger than expected, so comfortable, very clean and well kept, and we loved the little kitchenette area. We weren't expecting nearly what we received for the price. If we ever make our way back to this area again (which judging by our experience at the college, we definitely hope to)this will absolutely be our first choice in hotel accommodations."
Comfort Suites,"Very convenient location to shopping and restaurants in Springfield as well as close to Dayton. Continental breakfast provided many options, hotel staff were very friendly, and the beds were very comfortable. The only thing I would change is the sofa in the suite which was very worn and not comfortable."
Comfort Suites,"Staff was very friendly. Other than individual I spoke to in the phone a week prior to our stay, everyone on staff was very friendly and in sync. We stayed the first night of our honeymoon. Person we spoke to on the phone said they didn't do anything special for honeymoon which was fine. When we got to the hotel, however, the manager checked us in. He said that he ALWAYS does something for honeymooners and apologized for the misinformation. Wonderful hotel! No complaints."
Comfort Suites,"I didn't like the coffee or the high beds, but I must give an excellent commendation to the night manager who aided me when I fell in my room and needed help getting up. She was most helpful and caring...thank you, Carly!"
Comfort Suites,Love the cleanest and the politeness but when I booked the room there was never a mention about a deposit
Comfort Suites,"We needed a place to stay on the way and this was just off the interstate with restaurants and gas stations. It was easy to find, clean, good breakfast, large room with nice beds and pillows. No complaints at all."
Comfort Suites,Few problems but good stay
Comfort Suites,Rooms much larger than expected and a Jacuzzi tub and pull out couch in our king sized room. Hotel staff very friendly
Comfort Suites,"My entire immediate family got rooms at the hotel for a reunion in a nearby town. The rooms were awesome! Super spacious, comfortable beds, nice couch to relax on and the little kitchenette was great to have. The bathrooms were a little on the cozy side, but the rest of the rooms were great. Hotel staff was super friendly and the breakfast was wonderful! I would definitely recommend another stay at this location."
Comfort Suites,"GOOD RENOVATIONS IN PROGRESS. DISAPPOINTED IN RUST, CORROSION AND DIRT AT SWIMMING POOL - PROBABLY THE LAST THING FOR RENOVATIONS. STAFF HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY."
Comfort Suites,Good
Comfort Suites,We stayed there for our soccer tournament weekend would have to go to first floor for ice in vending machines they only have one elevator and that I would have to wait on it often
Comfort Suites,"Although it shows a little age and isn't fancy, this hotel was mostly well kept clean. The paint could use a fresh coat, but overall it was clean and comfortable. We would be willing to stay again."
Comfort Suites,Hotel was nice clean. Breakfast was very good and the attendant very quick to keep things filled up and clean. Could have been a disastrous stay as I left my company I-Pad in the room and checked out. About 10 minutes later I got a call from the manager that housecleaning had turned it in and it would be available for me to pick up. Luckily we had stopped at the antique malls not far away. I returned right away and was reunited with the I-Pad after showing i.d. I was very grateful and asked if I could leave a reward for the honest housekeeper which I was told yes. There's something to be said about integrity and how it reflects on the whole operation.
Comfort Suites,"We were there for our daughter's wedding. The front desk help was very good. The beds were sooooooooooo comfortable! Shower is great. Liked having a couch in our room. Would like to have higher quality TP and tissue, and a room safe."
Comfort Suites,No problems at all
Comfort Suites,Daniella who was taking care of the continental breakfast
Comfort Suites,"we stayed at the country in last time, this place was 100 better"
Comfort Suites,"We've have stayed at this hotel three times now, as it is near the college that our son attends in Cedarville (about 15 mins south). We have found it be clean and comfortable each time. The complimentary breakfast is also well done each morning. It has everything we need for a nice night's stay."
Comfort Suites,The staff was very friendly and the facility was nice. Close to Wittenberg and interstate!!
Comfort Suites,"Excellent Customer Service......Carol and her staff were very helpful and friendly. They were able to accommodate us during a very difficult time. The room was very nice, spacious and clean. They also gave us a later checkout time to accommodate funeral services."
Comfort Suites,Cracker Barrel next door.
Comfort Suites,"Hotel itself was acceptable. For a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be on par with what one would reasonably expect. Unfortunately my car window was smashed during the night property was stolen. Mgmt alerted me to the break in and was polite and accommodating when asked for assistance. However I have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned. It took 3 attempts to get the police dept to respond. The 1st officer was sympathetic but explained there was nothing they could do. The 2nd officer was very short tempered and said that they simply did not have time to deal with minor crimes. The 3rd officer, who actually did come to the hotel, told me that I should not stay anywhere at that particular interchange due to the very high crime rate and that I should leave the area as soon as possible. I could not drive the car with my young son because of the amount of glass everywhere in the car. Because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm. This made for a long night of driving home after a very stressful day. Hotel staff was adamant that there was not room for me to stay an additional night and did not allow me to stay in our room past 3:00pm. We wound up camping out in the lobby. Hotel mgmt seemed to indicate that a room might be available. To be perfectly honest I could not stay another night at the hotel and expect to get any sleep. It was a scary situation that could have been much worse."
Comfort Suites,Hotel is too close to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room.
Comfort Suites,"Our room was large and very clean ... and the bed was very comfortable. It was extra nice to have a couch, fridge and microwave. We enjoyed the good and helpful service given by Shayla at breakfast. We would recommend this hotel."
Comfort Suites,Nice clean place with a friendly staff and expected Comfort Inn breakfast. Very quiet too. Kids had fun in pool and the front desk manager at check in was helpful with recommendations for sights on our travels.
Comfort Suites,"Most personnel were very friendly and helpful. One front desk employee failed to resolve a problem I was having with the lobby computer, and offered no alternate solution. Paper products (TP, facial tissue) are of inferior quality. Breakfast was mediocre, but there are many restaurants in the area to find a decent breakfast. Although this is a non smoking hotel, cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor."
Comfort Suites,"It was nice that there was lemon water for those who like that. However, the most convenient water fountain was in the pool area and it was rusted making retrieving water from there undesirable. Please replace that water fountain."
Comfort Suites,The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean! There was construction taking place to update the hotel but it wasn't a distraction or inconvenience at all! I will definitely be returning when visiting family in town again!
Comfort Suites,Wonderful hotel. Room was spacious and quiet. Staff was very helpful.
Comfort Suites,"Restfull evening, Thank you."
Comfort Suites,Nice stay. Courteous staff. Extremely nice rooms Would stay again.
Comfort Suites,breakfast was good. I wish there was scrambled eggs.
Comfort Suites,"This hotel was on the more expensive side given the area. When I first walked in, it was very well decorated and I was excited. However, the staff completely ruined that by failing to greet me. I told her I had a reservation (after she failed to say anything). She rudely stated she needed my name. The room was ok. I bought one with the hot tub (I know it was probably gross but I didn't care). The signage with instructions for the hot tub was incorrect, which made turning on the jets confusing. Other small issues included a stain on the carpet, cobwebs near the window, knots of hair stuck to the wash cloth, and an air conditioner that came on and off every two minutes. The one positive was the bed seemed clean and comfortable. Not the worst place I've stayed, but not the best either."
Comfort Suites,"I was EXTREMELY pleased with this hotel. Given the price, my expectations were low so I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Room was very clean, nicely appointed and the staff was friendly. The beds were comfortable and quiet. There as a college track team at the hotel as well as quite a few high school aged volleyball teams. The ooms were situated so that it was not a problem and we didn't hear a sound. The beds were outstanding and I slept great (which is rare for me at hotels). The only downside was the lack of restaurants and the neighborhood. Because its right off the highway the management doesn't have a lot of control over the kind of characters in the area. Overall, I would stay here again without hesitation and the price makes it an unbelievable deal."
Comfort Suites,"We stayed overnight for our antique hunting visit. It was like most other places of this type. Comfortable beds, nice to have a fridge and microwave. Clean enough. The light in the bathroom was a very cool feature. At night it would go on automatically when you entered. No need to be searching for the light switch. Breakfast was the... More"
Comfort Suites,"Location easily missed... Blocked behind a Red Roof and Hampton Inn, on narrow side street, and overlooking Interstate. Upgraded room in need of redecorate. Poor breakfast....no eggs( refrigerated boiled eggs) to go with cold sauages, and hard rolls/bakery. Disappointed for the rate."
Comfort Suites,"We recently stayed here for a family function. We were not going to spend much time here so I didn't want to pay up for a luxury hotel. The rooms were large 2 double beds with lots of pillows. Desk, chair, kitchenette, Seating area with sofa and table nice large TV. Room was clean, bathroom was clean everything in good... More"
Comfort Suites,"Over all the stay was fine, but got a jacuzzi room for my wife and I to use. Said 2 person tub, but was more like 1 and a half unless you are skinny models. Plus the jacuzzi tube was in a corner with no lighting at all."
Comfort Suites,"We always stay here when we are visiting the area, it is always nice, clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent, I recommend staying here and will stay here on our next antiquing or car event trip!"
Comfort Suites,Only shortcoming was two doubles and not two queens as an option
Comfort Suites,Pleasant for one night traveling.
Comfort Suites,"I would have given this hotel a positive review, HOWEVER, the experience we had at checkout was awful. As we were leaving, my fianc got an alert on his card that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee. Upon checkout, we were informed that we were charged for smoking! We never smoked in the room, and no one had even been in our room to check, yet they just knew it was us. After we insisted our room be checked, it was determined that the odor was coming from a different room, and we were promised that fee would be reversed. IT STILL HASN'T BEEN! I found the staff to be very rude judgemental. We will NOT be returning due to their attitudes and behavior towards us!!!"
Comfort Suites,This is a very nice comfortable hotel. The rooms are big very nicely decorated and cozy. Convenient to the highway.
Comfort Suites,Lovely hotel with nice amenities. Right next to Cracker Barrel and convenient to the highway and to town.
Comfort Suites,"Excellent hotel. Good,spacious,clean rooms. Nice breakfast. Friendly service"
Comfort Suites,OUR STAY WAS GREAT.... VERY CLEAN... FRIENDLY SERVICE....HOWEVER THE BREAKFAST WAS AWFUL.... TASTELESS AND NOT HOT. OTHER WISE I WOULD RECOMMEND .
Comfort Suites,Perfect
Comfort Suites,"We were able to get a very nice room using the coupon offer we picked up on our trip. The person checking us in was very pleasant, handling other customers and the phone by herself. The room was very clean and nicely maintained, as the entire property appeared to be. The complementary breakfast was good, sorry there was no bacon.... More"
Comfort Suites,"Hotel is worn, room was clean. Air conditioner needed to work, did not cool off the room properly."
Comfort Suites,Comfort Suites at this location is comfortable. This is a reasonably new and well maintained facility with a parking lot that is adjacent to Cracker Barrel. It is quite near an interstate highway and thus has the associated noise of traffic but that is easily covered by the white noise of the air conditioner fan. It is easy to find... More
Comfort Suites,"Was in Springfield for the Antique Extravaganza, so had booked room several months in advance. Location was great for us, overall fine stay. We had to get a Jacuzzi room because nothing else was available. I would not recommend unless the tub really means something to you. In that floor plan, the bathroom is quite small."
Comfort Suites,I felt just like at home. The manager LK was professional and very accommodating. He made sure our stay was very comfortable. The breakfast staff was very courteous and friendly and always made sure that the breakfast bar was clean and stocked. The restroom was good and the beds were comfortable and the pillows were perfect. Cleanliness was top of... More
Comfort Suites,We were given a room directly across the hall from the elevator. I was worried that we would hear every one coming and going from the elevator. However that was not the case. I never once heard noise coming from the hallway or other rooms. This is an older motel but it has been very nicely remodeled. The finishes were... More
Comfort Suites,Very nice hotel and great customer service
Comfort Suites,"This is our first time staying at this hotel (we've stayed at other nearby places in the past). And, this is a very nice place. The customer service was excellent and the staff was very helpful (they helped us with direction on navigating US 68). The room that we stayed in was a little more then what we were expecting.... More"
Comfort Suites,Nice hotel but to close the road. If you are a light sleeper the noise from the trucks dose not give you a good night sleep. The breakfast was good and the room was clean. Front desk people very nice and there was a Crackel Barrel with in walking distance.
Comfort Suites,"Our stay was acceptable. Where the room had issues, the staff was incredibly helpful. I brought our room issues to their attention and we were generously refunded a portion of our discounted rate. The manager on duty explained that they were slowly renovating the master suites and that our issues would be addressed with the owner."
Comfort Suites,"I was tired, hot - and then angry.The hotel would not honor my reservation - said it didn't exist. The manager was rude, not helpful, turned away from me. No chance I'll stay there again."
Comfort Suites,"We will never be staying there again. They started off by serving the worst breakfast I have ever seen. Watered down waffle mix Apple juice and orange juice just to save money (yea I'm hip to their game). Then as you walk into the pool room we almost passed out from how much chlorine was in the water and we had to open the door to outside (surprised they could afford the chlorine). As we began to swim, the bottom of the pool was so broken that it cut all of our feet up. So then we proceed to get out and the manager is waiting on all of my kids saying they need to be completely dry before they leave the pool room. Having the lady lol everywhere we walked . EVERY hotel has water foot prints at some point and time from guests going back to their room from their swim time. He's asking me how many people we had and the number was correct ( heaven forbid we have one extra person that would cost him money). He was so unprofessional, and as he didn't think we were going to notice the bleach stains on the couch they tryed to clean and the black couch arms(yuck). I could even breathe from my OCD kicking in overdrive. Price list for each individual item unaccounted for posted everywhere and it is already known to leave all hotel items behind or you could be subject to fees but wow. I checked out early and got my money back. This particular hotel is a disaster and used to be a good one before this new owner...all about the money, not the wellbeing of the customer."
Comfort Suites,"The staff and facility are outstanding! From checking in a group of 50 people (our high school *World Champion* Winds Ensemble), to everyone enjoying a comfortable night of sleep, to a delicious free breakfast, everything went smoothly. The night manager was very well organized for our large group checking in at the same time. The breakfast buffet stayed well-stocked by... More"
Comfort Suites,"Room had an odd, empty addition to it so I guess that's a suite, no matter since I was alone I just found it interesting. Right next to I-70 but never heard anything from highway. Neighborhood coming into the hotel from exit is a little sketchy but surrounding area was quiet enough."
Comfort Suites,Everything was great. Only issue I had was that the double beds are awfully small so I asked for a pull out for my 6 year old that moves a lot and the service desk didn't seem to thrilled and told he was charging me if I wanted it at 1 am. It will definitely be a long night. Thanks....... More
Comfort Suites,"My wife and I stopped here on our way to NY and we enjoyed the place very much. Both of us could not think of any cons from the stay. The room was pleasantly arranged and presented, and clean. I told the mrs. that it was too bad we weren't staying longer. Other Pros were: Easy on/off I 70 The... More"
Comfort Suites,"Nice hotel to stay at. The room was clean, it was quiet. Nothing was broken and it smelled good. We did not try the breakfast. Check in and out was super easy. Plenty of parking. Will definitely be back."
Comfort Suites,Very nice staff. The hotel is very clean and comfortable with a nice breakfast served between 6-10am and it included in the stay.
Comfort Suites,"This hotel is well located, reasonably priced, and has a very accommodating staff. I made several minor requests while staying there and all were quickly answered in a very positive way. There is nothing fancy about this hotel, but it served our needs for a three night stay very well. The breakfast was not fancy, but provided as much variety... More"
Comfort Suites,Very nice hotel. Quiet and right next door to Cracker Barrel what more could you ask for . Beds comfy and staff great to work with. Front desk clerk at night shift was awesome. Forget his name but we stayed night of May 9th. Thanks again for great breakfast and goooooood coffee. Comfort suites never disappoints.
Comfort Suites,"Arrived late, not surly, but not the friendliest check in . Room typical, sofa way too soft. Bathroom good, beds very comfortable, nice little fridge etc. Breakfast bar typical, what were those yellow turds I think they were eggs, probably powdered eggs with not enough butter or water added, glowing yellow color, no thanks."
Comfort Suites,"We were in town for one night for a wedding. We chose this hotel because we have had experience with the Choice Hotels line and have enjoyed our stays in other areas. The hotel is located very conveniently off the interstate. However, if you do not have GPS, you may have difficulty finding it among all the other hotels in... More"
Comfort Suites,"We were very pleased with our overnight stay at the Comfort Suites in Springfield, Ohio. The room was very comfortable and quiet. We enjoyed breakfast the next day and were treated well by Shayla in the breakfast restaurant. We also appreciated the price of the stay at this Comfort Suite. Thank you!"
Comfort Suites,"Restfull evening, Thank you."
Comfort Suites,"Stayed for 1 night only on New Years Eve 2015. We were advised at phone reservation and check in that no parties were to be had,or extra guests in to use pool. We had no problem with that, as we were going out anyway. Kind people, great sized room, kitchenette,clean room, bed and pillow were comfy, awesome check in area.... More"
Comfort Suites,Great place to stay was here for work fromt desk people are amazing! Rooms are amazingly large! Priced very reasonable definitely will return! Close to highway easy to find...... clean rooms safe parking for work trucks
Comfort Suites,"Comfortable is the key name for this hotel. The bed is lovely and the towels large and soft. There is an indoor pool, lots of tv channels, and the free internet works well. On top of that, the breakfast, although not exciting, is above average for a hotel."
Comfort Suites,"We loved our room -king size bed, sofa w fold out bed, microwave, refrigerator, and sink, plus bathroom, of course. It was spacious and being on the 4th floor, it was quiet. The room was very clean. The bathroom was a bit on the small size though and needs a little updating and maintenance. The swimming pool appears nice, but small. The pool room was too cool for us to take a dip. We would have frozen once we got out. The breakfast was the standard hot fare - instant eggs, sausage, biscuits, waffles, apples, bananas, oranges, yogurt, cereal, juice, and coffee. Our 3rd morning there, i noticed numerous ants on the table where the coffee was. i told the breakfast lady, who cleaned it up."
Comfort Suites,My family stayed at Comfort Suites for 2 nights because we were in town for a baseball tournament at Wittenburg University. The hotel was right off of the exit and no more than 10 minutes from the school. Cracker Barrel is across the parking lot and there are several other restaurants only a few minutes away. Although we did not... More
Comfort Suites,Hotel staff were very pleasant and willing to help. The king suite we had was very roomy! We could of stayed a few nights and been quite comfortable. The breakfast was good with lots of options from eggs to waffles to fruit and cereal. Would definitely stay here again
Comfort Suites,"We have stayed here before and so far have been happy. They have been renovating as time goes on. The only minus is that there is only 1 elevator that is shared with housekeeping and maintenance, and it is very slow. Rooms are clean and beds are comfy. I did happen this am that the shower did not have very... More"
Comfort Suites,I travel a lot and stay here at least 4 times a year. The staff is always warm and friendly even through a remodel this hotel was clean. Our room is always spacious and clean they go above and beyond for their guest. Never disappointed when we stay here!!
Comfort Suites,Love the cleanest and the politeness but when I booked the room there was never a mention
Comfort Suites,"Stopped here late one night and was pleasantly surprised to find a very quiet, very clean hotel. When I laid down I could smell the clean crisp bedding, the carpet super clean as was the bathroom. The next morning the breakfast had crisp bacon, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, low fat yogurt, fruit, and everything was spotless and everyone smiling... More"
Comfort Suites,"This is the best Comfort Suites I had stayed in across the USA. Although they are usually pretty standard this one excelled with their staff! Of particular note is the kitchen attendant Shayla! She took the extra steps to make the food better and the presentation nicer. Instead of a firm pan of solid eggs, she stirred them and added...

Comfort Suites,"We stopped here on our way home from vacation. We can't say enough about this place. Not one issue! The room and hotel in general were all very clean. The staff was friendly. Our room was huge, quiet and comfortable. The breakfast was plentiful with most everything that you could want and it was well staffed. She kept the area... More"
Comfort Suites,"Don't read this if you don't like whining, because as I wrote this, I realized that's what it sounds like... sorry, but if you want 3 stars or more, you've got some work to do. So, we got a good rate through Expedia, felt good about that. Checking in, well that's where the disappointments started. The lady at the desk was not friendly at all, sloppy, no smile, etc. We got the room keys and the room was clean, so okay, going better. The HVAC controls didn't seem to work as we thought they should - eventually it seemed like it was okay - cooled the room down nicely. The bathroom could have been really nice, but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip. The edge of the tub had one chip repaired and another not yet repaired. On to breakfast in the morning. Eggs were overcooked and cold, but otherwise it was generally okay - nothing to write home about. We used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was broken like the enclosure was missing, which made it awkward to slide the access card for entry. It is in a good location, close to the freeway and several fast food places."
Comfort Suites,"Nice, clean and quiet! Can't ask for much better for a good nights sleep. Beds are small in the double rooms but comfortable and clean. Excellent breakfast bar and friendly employees. Last stop on our way home on a three week road trip and glad we stopped here."
Comfort Suites,"Large clean rooms, comfy beds, friendly staff, free breakfast, restaurants within walking distance. I'd definitely stay here again"
Comfort Suites,Stayed here for a wedding. Very nice hotel and comfy beds.

Comfort Suites,"This is our first choice of hotel when visiting our daughter at Cedarville University. It is safe, clean, very friendly and quite nice. The rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. It has recently been remodeled and made even nicer. Breakfast buffett is generous and there is always coffee available, iced water and afternoon popcorn."
Comfort Suites,"The hotel in under renovations, would have been nice to know. However,it is going to be great when completed. Our room was one of the completed rooms and it was great! The gentlemen who was the night desk clerk was friendly and accommodating, as was the lady working the breakfast. The breakfast was well stocked and fresh. Pool was only opened from 10 to 10, that was a negative. The desk clerk working the morning we checked out was a bit grumpy!"
Comfort Suites,"We decided to meet up with my husband as he was delivering the next morning locally. After a phone call to the hotel, the front clerk put a room on hold for us. Upon arrival, the clerk remembered the phone call and check in was quick and easy. The evening clerk was helpful, cheerful and very welcoming. Truck parking was... More"
Comfort Suites,"We were passing this way, traveling to another destination. This facility was really excellent for this price point. The breakfast was good. The room was clean and comfortable. The desk staff was helpful and friendly. My wife and sons enjoyed the pool."

Comfort Suites,"Editorial Review Nationwide hotel chain offers family-friendly stay. Amenities include outdoor heated pool and spa, exercise facility and daily continental breakfast."
Comfort Suites,"I travel to Springfield on business every three months. Renovations that had begun back in March were nowhere close to being complete. If anything, things were worse the lobby is currently torn apart with a staircase removal that requires temporary wooden barriers on the second level. In addition, the room air conditioner did not cool even though it was turned to its coldest setting. I have stayed here multiple times in the past, but probably not again."
Comfort Suites,Have stayed at this hotel on three different occasions at different times of the year. Room prices vary quite a bit depending on the time of year. Always pleasant reception upon check in and room is always ready. Coffee available at all times and the breakfast is always hot and a decent variety of hot and cold choices. Fruit and... More
Comfort Suites,"This hotel was literally the most disgusting hotel ever we found hair in our ""clean towels"" and blood on a washcloth and the edge of our Jacuzzi. The front desk clerk told us it was ""paint"". It's not."
Comfort Suites,"Wonderful Service, compared with Quality Inn for same fee, new Rooms, Restaurante walking distances, Chin eese Restaurantes Panda is a must,  Mexican ""El Torito"" The Kraker Barrel 60 steps away!!"
Comfort Suites,"I've stayed here a few times because of the location on a long trip I make to visit family. It is a great value. I have stayed at other hotels at this exchange but have decided that I like Comfort Suites the best. The staff is friendly and really seem to care about us guests. I feel safe there while traveling alone, which I didn't feel at some of the other hotels. The amenities are solide with coffee, breakfast, A/C, hairdryer, fridge, microwave, etc. my only two complaints are the pillows are too full and fluffy and the pool doesn't open until 10 am so I cannot get my morning water aerobics in. Otherwise, the rooms are spacious and affordable. Great value here."
Comfort Suites,You get a discount here when you mention you're visiting Cedarville University! :)
Comfort Suites,"Stayed here while helping a county dog shelter. Came back to the hotel exhausted and filthy...and the shower and beds were great! The front desk woman was nice and helped us find places to eat in the area. Ovrall, great stay!"
Comfort Suites,wifi is good
Comfort Suites,We stayed here for baseball tournament and really enjoyed our stay! The staff were really nice and made us feel at home and welcome. We will return to this hotel when we play there again. Love the suites for extra space!! The only complaint was the donuts in the breakfast bar. I told the ladies working down there I was... More
Comfort Suites,"This hotel is very convenient to all kinds of shopping and right off the freeway. Our room was clean. Our kids were happy to swim in the pool...it closed at 10 and was nice for getting their energy out after being in the car for a while, but the lighting wasn't great and I couldn't tell if the pool water...

Comfort Suites,"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More"
Comfort Suites,"In town for 1 night. The staff was very friendly. I thought the managers reception was a nice touch! The breakfast had plenty of variety the rooms are brand new! I love the smell of new carpets. The location great since you are close to the mall, movies, and Pringles Park."
Comfort Suites,"Stopped here on our way home from a business trip to Louisville, KY. A snow and ice storm delayed our travel, and this hotel showed up on the radar at just the right time. One of the best decisions we made during the trip as this location is one of the nicest I've stayed in... and I've stayed in quite... More"
Comfort Suites,Stayed here for business. Location is great. Right off interstate and close to all kinds of places to eat. Room was very nice and big. Hotel was quiet and no loud noise.

Comfort Suites,This was a last minute decision and would only stop again if nothing else was available. Took forever to even see if they had a room as they were having internet problems. And of course internet service was very bad. Finally just gave up trying to connect. The pool has drainage problems and there was a lot of water around... More
Comfort Suites,I love staying at a Comfort Suites that is just as they advertise. They have wonderful beds. They are always soft and they give you 4 pillows to each bed. The breakfast is always great. They were checking on it at all times and making sure everyone was able to get what they want.
Comfort Suites,Its a comfortable place to stay at reasonable rates but don't like being asked for tips at the managers reception or at breakfast the next morning... especially when the beer was lukewarm and not freely available..and the next morning more tip solicitation with cold hash browns served...YUK..
Comfort Suites,"Our family of 6 traveled to Gulf Shores Alabama from Iowa which is about a 18 hour trip. We decided to stop about mid way which is just about half way.

I enjoyed this quite a bit and it was nice not having to leave the... More"
Comfort Suites,"After being on the road for a few days and staying at one horrendous hotel in OK City, we were beyond pleased with this stay!

Comfort Suites,"I will stay here again. Easy drive from Memphis or Nashville. Plenty of eating options, and a Planet Fitness gym within a couple minutes of hotel. Very clean, smells good, nice staff. The only bad thing is the treadmill slips, AFTER you start running on it...I hate that please fix it.Nice free food in the evening, and great breakfast."
Comfort Suites,"We travel through Jackson every year coming back from visiting family in Dallas. Every year we've stayed at a different hotel/motel, from low to high end, trying to find a place that meets our needs-clean, friendly, comfortable, and well located. In the Comfort Suites, we feel that we've found it at last. We will be regular customers from now on.... More"
Comfort Suites,"This is a really good hotel to stay at. However, don't expect anything fancy or just fabulous because this isn't it. Overall, it's really good though. GREAT food workers!!....also great for a good nights rest!! There shouldn't be any disturbing noises unless your neighbors are just extremely loud Lol. Great hotel though. Would 99 suggest"
Comfort Suites,We pulled into this hotel as a respite from highway driving. They charged us the best available internet rate as a walk-in... and that has seldom happened to us before (usually always higher). The hotel is fairly new. The handicapped accessible room was very spacious and comfortable. There was a Manager's Reception in the evening that allowed us to forego... More

Comfort Suites,We were very disappointed in our stay here. The hotel is supposed to be new but it is not well maintained if it is. Cleanliness is an issue from the dried food on the outside of the trash can by the main entrance to the mildewed caulk in the tub. Our main complaint is the noise from the road. We... More

Comfort Suites,The motel had one flaw. It could use an update. Other than that everything was great! The front desk was really friendly. The beds were comfortable. Breakfast was hot and good. But the best part was the access to the Metro. We were able to get to the metrolink fast and no hassle. Then take it right to the stadium... More
Comfort Suites,Our first clue of how this stay was going to go should have been when the lady checking us in didn't know exactly where our room was located. We had the loudest neighbor ever. Constant coughing from them all night. Had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise. At about 9:00 the next morning housekeeping started... More
Comfort Suites,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times. I am always pleased with it. The staff is so friendly. They make you feel like they appreciate you choosing this hotel.

Comfort Suites,"The Comfort Suites in Fairview Heights, IL is the most reasonably priced in the area. The hotel is old and could use some updating. The carpet needs to be replaced.

Comfort Suites,We had a very nice stay here. Room was clean and staff was friendly and helpful. Only drawback in my book was that there was no hot tub which I really enjoy after a whole day in the car. But I survived and we had a very pleasant stay.
Comfort Suites,"My family stayed here for a week while visiting the St. Louis area. It is a comfortable, clean hotel for under 100 a night. Convenient to the expressway but farenough away so that you don't hear it. The usual Comfort Inn breakfast buffet is available in the morning, ok but nothing to write home about. Staff is friendly and helpful,... More"
Comfort Suites,"We chose this hotel because of proximity to St. Louis, and having stayed at Comfort Suites before felt confident we would have a good stay. We were disappointed. While the bedding and towels were clean, the general state of the room was rather dismaying. Several stains pocked the carpet. Dead or mostly dead insects lined the sill of the window... More"
Comfort Suites,Very nice and clean room. Staff was excellent.
Comfort Suites,The motel was easy to find and had easy access to and from the attractions we came to visit in West Monroe. However when we arrived the swimming pool was GREEN and was not expected to be nor was it cleared up by the time we left. We were told we could use the Quality Inn next door for swimming but having so many of us determined it was too far to walk for a swim---my autistic son and my grandchildren were greatly disappointed. I chose this motel over others because it offered according to your listing a roll away bed for our convenience since there were six of us and when we arrived there not only was no roll away bed available the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one. The request was for my Autistic son to be able to sleep alone as this is one of his main needs. I slept on the floor so he could have a bed alone---not comfortable at all for a senior lady with health issues myself. The motel adjusted my rate due to the lack of use of the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent. The staff was VERY gracious... I would like to know if I will receive a refund as I had prepaid for the room
Comfort Suites,water was YELLOW!!! They did move us to a different room during a very busy weekend for them and the staff was GREAT!!!
Comfort Suites,"The staff was great. There was a hole in the wall, that wasn't a problem but we didn't want anyone to think we did it. The breakfast was good. We had an operator error problem with the air conditioner but Tim fixed it as soon as we asked him to. Shantel helped us with WiFi on Mom's tablet. We were treated like family."
Comfort Suites,Nice hotel. Staff not friendly at all.
Comfort Suites,It was nicer than expected. Our refrigerator in our room wasn't working. That's our only complaint.
Comfort Suites,"Everything was great except the carpets was a bit dirty. Every time we walked around bare footed, our feet turned black but this was the only issue. Overall a very nice room :)"
Comfort Suites,"Went to attend a high school graduation. the room was clean and comfortable. A mini suite well appointed with sleeper sofa, fridge and microwave. Miscommunication with housekeeping resulted in our room not being cleaned on the second day but we did get fresh towels."
Comfort Suites,"It was very pleasant! I honestly had no complaints, besides they need a new Dryer! :)"
Comfort Suites,It was a good stay...Everything worked...
Comfort Suites,"The hotel was close to the airport. I arrive very late at night. The staff was very friendly. My only complaint is that when I walked into my room, I walked into a freezer. Someone left the a/c on full blast. It didn't take long though for it to warm back up once I shut it off. Overall, it was a good stay."
Comfort Suites,"My stay was enjoyable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. This hotel definitely rivals the other more expensive big name chains. I would recommend to friends and family."
Comfort Suites,We traveled to Monroe for a wedding. The room was accommodating and conveniently located.
Comfort Suites,"When I booked I put I needed a crib. There were only two in the whole hotel. The one I got was broken. I had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights. Also the pool was empty with no water. After playing a very hot softball tournament, my children and all their friends also staying were disappointed not to be able to swim. Last, we left some headphones, which I know was our fault, but we have called twice now and no one can give me any information."
Comfort Suites,"Housekeeping knocked on our door persistently and loudly at about 8:15am until I got up and told them we weren't up yet. This was after we had arrived late at 2:15am just 6 hours earlier. Another annoying thing about that was that she proceeded to lecture me that I should have used the do not disturb sign. It was rude and unnecessary. Other than that, all was good."
Comfort Suites,Nice and roomy! Clean!!
Comfort Suites,"Clean rooms, helpful staff and includes hot breakfast."
Comfort Suites,"I just stayed overnight. Quiet hotel with nice bed and pillows, spacious and very clean. The deadbolt in my room did not work but I felt safe enough without it so I did not think it was worth changing rooms. I reported the deadbolt problem it in the morning, and the receptionist immediately filled in a report, so I guess they will take care of it ASAP."
Comfort Suites,We had a family of six stay in one room and we were comfortable.
Comfort Suites,"Upon entering my room, there were large holes in the bathroom door. Blood stains on the bed sheets, lamp shade, and curtains. Unacceptable, unclean!"
Comfort Suites,Same day made reserved thru hotels.com and four hours drive later and got a room. Not bad at all
Comfort Suites,"Was very nice, staff was friendly, and aside form the screaming kid in the hallway at 3am, stay was very nice. This area of Monroe does have a smell from the local mill outside, but inside was fine. Breakfast was adequate, nothing fancy."
Comfort Suites,Our stay was great however our room smelled like someone had been smoking in it
Comfort Suites,"Air condition did not work, children running in hallways all night, food on floor in hallways, being machine leking water and towels piled up to stop water etc, shower and tub dirty, couch was soaking wet, no soap or shampoo in bathroom"
Comfort Suites,"When we booked this room, we thought it was a Comfort Inn Suites. Not so. While you could tell they were making an effort to be a nice hotel, things just didn't add up. Our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area, the door didn't shut quite right, the bathroom lights only worked with a tricky combination of switches which took a minute or two to figure out. Oh, and the cable was out completely. On the upside, the sheets bedding were nice and clean and the staff was friendly. But we won't be staying there again."
Comfort Suites,"This hotel was great for an overnight stay. The bed and bathroom were both generally clean, however the rooms and hotel could have used a lot of general maintenance of a lot of small items. For instance, the hanger on the bathroom door was broken, and the trim could have used a little cleaning/caulking. We were, however, comfortable for the... More"

Comfort Suites,"excellent service,comfortable rooms,clean would definitely recommend"
Comfort Suites,This hotel was close to things we were doing while in Monroe and was easy to get to from the highway. The lobby was very nice and clean and check-in was quick. I was pleasantly surprised with the room as it was very large and very nice looking. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was good and there was... More
Comfort Suites,great service from the entire hotel staff
Comfort Suites,Cracker crumbs in the bed!!!
Comfort Suites,Outstandingly friendly service. My wives dress broke and the lady at front counter helped me find something to fix it with a smile. Room was nice and clean. Would recommend to anyone.
Comfort Suites,"We had a good night sleep, room was very clean. The staff was nice, not overly helpful or courteous. Pool was very small, not enough room for all of the occupants. Breakfast was good, not enough seating area though."
Comfort Suites,The room was very nice it just smelled like cheesy feet but overall was very clean but they need to clean the carpet.
Comfort Suites,Terrible neighborhood. When we arrived there was a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere. First room we were in the a/c was broken(not very comfortable in 103 degree heat). Certainly not worth the 160 we paid.
Comfort Suites,"My husband and I had an awesome experience over the weekend. The staff and the facility was wonderful. The room was fabulous. We recently stayed in a Hilton for 40 more per night, the lobby was grand but the room was no where near as nice or clean. I'm staying at Comfort Suites from now on. Only down fall... Unable to access pool, too many children, all day."
Comfort Suites,This hotel was filthy!! The comforter had a huge brown smelly spot on it and the rest if the room was grimy and reeked. Staff completely aloof and rude. For 150 a night this was a total ripoff!!
Comfort Suites,"The hotel staff was very nice, but the air conditioner in our room didn't work. It was 82 degrees in there all night. Also, there are things that seem worn out and in need of replacement, namely the fridge in our suite had rust spots on the front, there was some rust in the bathroom, etc. The continental breakfast was truly awful... Even compared to other continental breakfasts."
Comfort Suites,"Every one was awesome, the food was great but the indoor pool was not available! This was entirely to hot a summer to not be able to swim at the indoor pool.The location was absolutely perfect because you could connect to any and eveywhere and not get lost or travel to far."
Comfort Suites,Very friendly staff. Hi
Comfort Suites,"The one lady that worked the counter was no where to be found for the first 5 minutes we were there (10pm). She wore an extremely wrinkled shirt, quiet and didn't speak much. The parking was hard to get a trailer parked in. There were dirty cups and trash on tables in the eating area (front area). Ceilings had tons of dust or mold around the air vents. The rooms were comfortable, but did not feel safe in the surroundings."
Comfort Suites,"Rude staff, room was stink, sofa bed linens had a terrible odor, the fire alarm sounded every 2 hours in the middle of the night"
Comfort Suites,"Enjoyed our stay, friendly service, great price. Wish the swimming pool had been available to use."
Comfort Suites,"Good stay, nice distance within everywhere."
Comfort Suites,"We really liked this place. The room was nice and clean, and we had plenty of everything that we needed, the housekeeper did a very good job the next day when cleaning the room, much better than any other place I've ever stayed in and we really appreciated that. As soon as the doors opened, the place smelled clean and... More"
Comfort Suites,The outside of the hotel looks really nice but once you step through the front entrance it becomes apparent how old and tired the place is. The decor is dated and paint is needed. There's nothing within walking distance.

Comfort Suites,"After a twelve hour drive from Georgia, my husband I were very tired and ready to check in, go to our room so we could get some rest since we had more traveling ahead of us the next morning. I called ahead of time to let the front desk know we would be checking in after 9 p.m. They assured me it was no problem. As we arrived late, we went inside to check in there wasn't anyone at the front desk. We walked around the front looking for someone with no luck. Some other guests walked up as we were waiting with a question ended up leaving since there still wasn't anyone up front. We stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk from our cell phone. Nothing. Finally, a man walked out of a door right next to the front desk behind the counter. He clearly had been sleeping. I told him that we'd like to check in how long we'd been waiting up front. He was automatically argumentative about how long we'd been waiting. Being tired, after a long trip, I didn't say anything more to him about it. Then, we get to our room. The bathroom floor counters looked like they hadn't been cleaned at all. The only good thing about our stay at this hotel was the mattress on the bed. And who knows, may be just because we were so tired on top of that, had to deal with nonsense from an incompetent employee. Needless to say, we will never book with Comfort Suites in the future."
Comfort Suites,"Hotel was nice with spacious rooms. We stayed on the second floor right above the lobby area, which was a bit noisy at breakfast time... but at least I woke up to a very good smelling complimentary breakfast!!! There were several team staying the same night we were there and they never ran out of breakfast items which was kind... More"
Comfort Suites,"Despite reservation, this hotel was overbooked. They sent me next door to quality in, which was a cheap suite with motel 6 feel. It felt unsafe, and unclean. Even with my best effort I could not locate another hotel. The next day I was able to go to Comfort in, but because of the area, and being bumped. I will never return."
Comfort Suites,"This was a very nice, clean, quiet hotel. I enjoyed my two nights I stayed here while in Monroe on business. But what particularly impressed me the most was the front desk staff. Catherine and Tim were so pleasant, friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay there again because of them."
Comfort Suites,It was great very nice room
Comfort Suites,I dont mind comfurt suites there usualy hit or miss and I fig for the price this hotel would deff be a hit but I drive a 2015 tahoe and well at the gas staion next door I over heard two younger men talking about stealing my truck. I cod not belive what I was hearing. I was about to cut my losses with the hotel and its surrounding and I am origanly from Syracuse NY not the safest palce but Monroe LA seemd safe untill that night. had a hard time sleeping thinking my truck was going to be stolen. on my last trip to the parking lot to check my truck I noticed the hotel security (armed) and it helped a little bit just unsure why they would build a hotel in that part of town. but overall the hotel was a little dirty rugs could of been cleaner for 125 a night but if it was not for t the surroundings I would of returned. ...
Comfort Suites,Lots of noise from the traffic and railway.
Comfort Suites,"Bad neighborhood, uncomfortable hard beds. Air-conditioning broken in most rooms. Do not stay here. Spend the extra couple of dollars and stay at a Hampton. It was a brand new much nicer hotel."
Comfort Suites,Was woke up every hour from resident above. It sounded as if the ceiling was falling in. Then when they started breakfast it sounded like they were in my room slamming cabinets. Needless to say I didn't get much sleep. Access to Interstate was easy.
Comfort Suites,"We were booked at this hotel for a State Softball Tournament. The hotel location was very good close to restaurants, shopping, etc. The hotel was clean updated but we did encounter many maintenance issues (not just our room but several rooms that were traveling with our team). I would recommend that you ask to be placed away from... More"
Comfort Suites,It would have been a better stay if our room had been clean. It was so bad I felt like I had stuff crawling on me all night. I could not wait to check out.
Comfort Suites,"Let me say, we love comfort suites- we are reward card members and stay in them 6-8 times yearly. This hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that I have ever stayed in! Beginning with the rude man (who's accent made it extremely difficult to understand) all the way through check out - this hotel was a disappointment. The tiles... More"
Comfort Suites,"If you like big rooms, this is your place. Our Two Queens was incredibly large, clean and tidy. The lighting wasnt that great, but they have a lot of square footage to illuminate. The size allowed the beds to be placed a little further from the window unit, which is always a better setting than those with the air and... More"
Comfort Suites,"Hotel is located just off of I-20 and near lots of resturants and the MALL. Very clean, nice breakfast, lots of parking and a friendly staff.

Comfort Suites,"My first problem was the amount of towels in our room upon arrival, there was only one large towel(the one for the floor) and two face towels. We were in a handicap room. Second problem, the shower in the room, no matter what we did when it was time to use the shower head, the water was leaking out on... More"
Comfort Suites,Well I was in town on business and the 2 places I normally stay were booked so I tried this place. It seemed nice enough although a little dated. Check in was fast and staff friendly.

Comfort Suites,"I stayed the weekend here to attend a funeral. The outside of the hotel looked nice. The room was nice and clean. The beds are comfortable. The breakfast was ok, nothing grand. Where the problem came in was the service. The housekeepers knocked on the door at 8AM, which wasn't a problem because I had to attend a funeral at... More"
Comfort Suites,"Work took me to Monroe for a week and I stayed at this hotel. It was typical for other Comfort Suites I've stayed in. The breakfast was okay, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The desk staff was friendly and helpful during check in."
Comfort Suites,We stayed here just on our way through. It was adequate for our needs. Pricey for location. No AC in the hallways or they weren't on. Beds were comfortable breakfast was decent. Got the 2 queen bed with sleeper sofa for our family of six. Big enough for a one or two night stay. Need some deep cleaning and updates.
Comfort Suites,Arrived to find a very neat and clean room that was set up in a suite format with bedroom area distinguished from the adjacent sitting area with desk and sofa. Great arrangement with refrigerator and microwave.
Comfort Suites,"I was traveling alone from Amarillo Tx to Pensacola FL to see my new grandson. This was a little over halfway. Loved the hotel, comfortable...felt very safe...had a great nights sleep!"
Comfort Suites,We stayed here because of the reviews. It did not disappoint. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We will definitely stay here on our next visit. It is worth the money.
Comfort Suites,"This hotel was just okay for a night's stay. The counter staff was visibly not happy that we booked from hotels.com and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise. The sleeper sofa is barely larger than a twin bed although they claim it is queen size. If you plan on 2 kids using it, they better be toddlers or smaller. There is also a smell outside that comes from the river that can't be ignored. The rooms are clean enough but I would recommend a different choice in a nicer location."
Comfort Suites,"First time I stayed here a few weeks back for a night and it was on a week night. Stay, room and employees were fine. This time, we arrived on a Saturday night. We pulled up and a gang of about 20 youth were playing football in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch. There was about 6 adults with ice chests and lawn chairs having a somewhat drinking beer and having a tailgate party under the front lobby awning that you had to go around to get inside. Once inside no clerk to be seen, just a note on counter saying they were out helping other guests. After a ten minute wait they finally showed up. She informed us that our room had a broken door and that she would have to let us in and out each time we wanted to leave it. Only room left....Yeah!!! Then inside there was trash on the floor from the prior guests, hair on shower walls and toothpaste still in the sink. The TV would not work and we had to call the front desk in which the clerk showed up to tell us the TV was broken and that we had to put in each individual channel that we could not flip through to see what was on. The outside party has now moved inside and are watching football game in lobby and having a contest to see who can cheer the loudest. Their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot, now on the stairs having a contest to see who can stomp their feet the loudest running up and down the stairs. They ran out of breakfast items the next morning."
Comfort Suites,"Located at 1401 Mlk in Monroe, Louisiana. Spent one night here on the way to Dallas. Great folks and accommodations. Really enjoyed the treadmill and the breakfast area. Also used the laundry room while staying here."
Comfort Suites,"After a long night at a women's conference and having a broken down car, the beds were wonderful and so comfortable. Sleep was amazing. The ac unit was so quite, very unusual for a window unit. Love the night here."
Comfort Suites,"Here's a tip,  always flush when you are done."
Comfort Suites,"The hotel is conveniently located. We always stay at this hotel when we visit Monroe, LA. This is one of the nicest hotel at this location. The orange juice on the breakfast station was watered down. The breakfast buffet needs more variety. Add boil eggs. The eggs and meat station did not have enough food."
Comfort Suites,We stayed at the Comfort Suites in Monroe a couple of weeks ago. Upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a large group of adults and teenagers with large class bottles of alcohol that were being passed around. We checked into the room and after an hour realized that the temp had risen due to a... More
Comfort Suites,very helpful front desk when we arrived late at night (gave us great directions to find her when GPS was sending us the wrong way) Room was ok--we reserved for 6 and the hide a bed was a love seat that folded out. NO way to fit two people on it and my youngest had to sleep on the cushions on the floor. rooms can't hold more than 5 max. breakfast was ok.
Comfort Suites,Beautiful hotel and great staff will def stay here every time I come back to see family
Comfort Suites,"Nice hotel, breakfast was good too :)"
Comfort Suites,I was able to check in my room a couple hours earlier than I expected. The only problem was my key card didn't work but the young lady at front desk gave me another room and everyone on the staff was friendly.
Comfort Suites,The hotel was okay. Housekeeping of the rooms could be better. There was hair on the bathroom floor and urine on the bathroom toilet seat but other than that the room was clean. Glad I always pack cleaning supplies. Guest services was nice and friendly. The bed was a little hard for my preference but doable for the night.
Comfort Suites,"I disagree.... If it's yellow it's mellow, if it's brown flush it down."
Comfort Suites,"The staff room was great.. I got confused I thought that I had the suite. It includes a king size bed with 2 sofa beds. I enjoyed the variety of items for breakfast. Also had microwave, refrigerator coffee maker in room."
Comfort Suites,"Stopped for the night here on the way to Florida, overall good experience. Comfy beds and pillows, clean linens, well-stocked breakfast area only complaint was the bathroom floor looked liike it needed mopped."
Comfort Suites,"If you are being treated at any Texas Medical Center facility this is a good place to stay. Very clean, decent breakfast, and shuttle. The only negative is that the shuttle doesn't run in the middle of the day making it inconvenient to return to the hotel following an appointment. We have had to take a taxi a few times.... More"
Comfort Suites,"Pathetic and discriminatory. They have a free shuttle service, but it is not accessible to wheelchair users, and they don't care. The front desk did not do anything about the issue. I emailed the corporate customer care email address and they take unreasonable amounts of time to respond to emails and do not remedy the problem. The customer care email... More"
Comfort Suites,This Comfort Suites was a terrific hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and a good size. There was great food for breakfast and a large variety.

Comfort Suites,"Great location walking distance to NRG Stadium. Next door to Pappa BBQ (warning- good, but very smoky flavor). Hotel was nicely decorated, gave a warm welcome. Front desk staff was friendly, though distracted. Our room, while quite large (we had an accessible room), had two ACs that did not de-humidify the room. It felt damp/humid the whole stay. Though... More"
Comfort Suites,"The room was clean, the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was also good. But the kennel with the dogs was awful. These dogs starting barking at six in the morning. The television in my room was a twenty inch LG. I will never go back there again."
Comfort Suites,"Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium.....saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day."
Comfort Suites,"On our two trips prior to this one both the breakfast and the internet were below par. I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved. When you go to Texas for cancer treatment, the little things become big things. You can stay here with confidence."
Comfort Suites,Stayed here for two nights to visit MDA. The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. The internet worked great. The staff was nice. Close to many restaurants. I highly recommend. We stayed at Best Western the last visit and had a total different (bad) experience.
Comfort Suites,"I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel, but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there. I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people, but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston. My mom checked in for me since I...

Comfort Suites,"We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask.

Comfort Suites,We stayed here because of a family medical emergency.Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.
New York Marriott Marquis,"holiday wonder MY DAUGHTER AND I STAYED AT THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS FROM DEC. 4TH - 11TH, 2002. WE HAD NEVER BEEN IN N.Y. - WHAT A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION TO SUCH A SPECTACULAR CITY. THE ENTIRE HOTEL WAS DECKED OUT WITH GORGEOUS CHRISTMAS TREES AND FRESH POINSETTIAS. OUR ROOM WAS SPACIOUS, NEAT AND CLEAN. THE ROOM ATTENDANTS WERE FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS. MARRIOTT'S LOCATION IS INCREDIBLE - CLOSE TO EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO DO. IF I AGAIN GO TO N.Y., I WANT TO STAY HERE NOTHING COULD COMPARE WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF THE HOTEL AND TIMES SQUARE. VIEW RESTAURANT EXCELLENT."
New York Marriott Marquis,The most accommodating public restrooms. I highly recommend.
New York Marriott Marquis,"solid choice You can't beat the location and rooms are big and clean. Staff was very friendly. For those looking for a hotel in Times Square, I recoomend this hotel without reservation. The only bad thing I can say about the place is you seem to wait a bit for the elevators although it looks like they're trying to address that problem now with the construction of some new elevators."
New York Marriott Marquis,Lobby is on the 8th floor
New York Marriott Marquis,Very nice room is a little outdated feeling. You can easily get great views of Times Square (thankfully minus the noise) if you're on the right side of the hotel.
New York Marriott Marquis,Request for room on higher floors facing Broadway for an awesome view !
New York Marriott Marquis,No #bedbugs in this joint
New York Marriott Marquis,The best thing about this hotel is the location. Right on Time Square. Rooms and amenities are average. Again the location is unbeatable.
New York Marriott Marquis,"Amazing People in the NYMM Business Center I was staying at the Marriott Marquis this week for a business conference. I needed additional print-outs made and headed down to the business center where I met Sue, one of those rare, disarmingly fantastic customer service people. I encountered a whole mess of technical difficulties. Sue kept making suggestions for work arounds, she got quite busy at several different times and somehow still made everyone feel heard and taken care of. I would have been frustrated with me 15 minutes after I walked in and she was so incredibly patient not only with me, but with every person who came in. When I left she handed me my copies and said You poor thing, having to be up here for a whole hour! As if I wasn't being an incredibly persistent, irritating, technically challenged pain in the ass. I don't even want to call my experience there customer service, because that somehow feels processed. It was human kindness. And at a really stressful time, Sue helped me figure my problem out in a way that made me feel like a friend, not a customer. Thank You!"

New York Marriott Marquis,One of the best hotel fitness centers in the city���overlook Times Square as you work out!
New York Marriott Marquis,The View on the 48th rotates 360 degrees in an hour. A thrill on a clear day. Excellent buffet at reasonable prices & creative cocktails.
New York Marriott Marquis,"The elevators are very strange, but the rooms are big by Manhattan standards."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Waiting, waiting, still waiting for an elevator Avoid this hotel at all costs. They have devised an elevator system that is so consistently unavailable, it defies description. Average wait in our week long stay ...15 minutes!! Escaltors were broken during our visit. Trapped, long-suffering guests were openly hostile about the system and we often overcrowded the lone elevator (2000 rooms) when our impatience trumped fear. Go ANYWHERE else!"
New York Marriott Marquis,"The broadway theater here is awesome . Even you got a student rush ticket, the view is still good. I don't think there is any real partial view spot here."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Wonderful location! The location is wonderful: walking distance from most Broadway theaters. Spacious room, very comfortable beds. The elevators need some work: slow, and often crowded. I'd go back in a New York minute."
New York Marriott Marquis,Check out Marriott Marquis as seen on Chopped Read more
New York Marriott Marquis,"What's not to like Although pricey, great location, excellent service, exceptionally clean and large rooms. Efficient check-in. Could use more choices for dessert and drinks after show. Every staff member was courteous, helpful, and well informed. Elevators still need some work!"
New York Marriott Marquis,"At first you'd think their lift system is kinda cool, until there are two dozens of people waiting to get on. Then you'll probably welcome the traditional press up and down buttons."

New York Marriott Marquis,Great View
New York Marriott Marquis,"Little secret for when you're in Times Sq & need to use the restroom: Walk in like you're a guest, take the escalator to the 2nd floor to the loo in the corner. Cleanest bathroom in Times Square!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Great bar on 8th floor with wifi
New York Marriott Marquis,Best place for business or team meetings. Central location and beautiful views of Time Square.
New York Marriott Marquis,Always check your mattress for bedbugs....especially in touristy hotels in NYC!
New York Marriott Marquis,"Decent Stay Everything you've read about the elevators is true. The hotel is in a good location, close to everything including the annoying crowds in Times Square. It's convenient to many subways. I appreciated the amenities, such as the fitness center and the business center. The room lacked visual appeal but was huge by NYC standards. Staff was very courteous. A decent value if you can book for under 200/night."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Great Hotel for Tourists! Both of my parents grew up in NYC so when I was growing up we used to visit a couple times a year. I've stayed in hotels all over the city but this one was always my favorite. Its in a great location for tourists. Times Square is right outside your door and all the Broadway shows are within walking distance. This is a great place to stay for singles, families or anyone else visiting the city who wants to be in the middle of everything."
New York Marriott Marquis,We got a awesome room and the view was great.  Service was quick
New York Marriott Marquis,Great view ����
New York Marriott Marquis,Bathroom floors this reflective are really only appropriate at a gay club.
New York Marriott Marquis,Top of Time Square At check in I asked for an up grade to city view room. 37th floor over looking Times Square. Accommadations were great. Room was big with Fantastic view of the city. Staff were very friendly. Checked out the top View lounge which rotates and the 8th floor bar which I thought was the better of the two. Martinis were hugh. One draw back was the Elevator system.
New York Marriott Marquis,Sucks .... No free internet even at the business centre. Cant believe this ... Prefer novotel... Nice service and breakfast
New York Marriott Marquis,Take the escalator.  Fast way to lobby.
New York Marriott Marquis,"Great Location, Great View We loved staying at the Marriott Marquis. The location is 2nd to none being right in the Heart of Times Square. More than enough elevators to service the number of people using them. The longest wait for an elevator was maybe 2 minutes. Located very close to the many Broadway shows. Many subway stations within a couple of blocks to take you anywhere in the city you want to go. Sushi restaurant is fair. Hotel Staff was very friendly and professional. Molinda at the front desk was especially pleasant and friendly. We loved her. Joey Tampa, Florida"
New York Marriott Marquis,"It might sound as much noise or uncomfortable place to stay, but I found quite safe and best place for family trip to new york city. Service need more improvement."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Very nice I have a prejudice against big hotels, but our stay here was very pleasant. The staff was helpful, the room was larger than I expected, and the location is excellent. The rotating top floor lounge, the View, does live up to its name. But, drinks are expensive (12 for a glass of wine)."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Location, Location, Location In the heart of Times Square this place is really first class in all its aspects. From the service to the rooms to the revolving restaurant around NYC on the 66th floor. The place is but you can tell exactly what you are paying for when you stay there."
New York Marriott Marquis,"8th floor lounge is a great place to sit and relax during the day, this is a great place to stop and use the restroom too. Take the glass elevators!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Bathrooms are nice and super clean.  Charge your phone while you're here!

New York Marriott Marquis,"Nice place, Good music!!!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Right in the middle of Times Square
New York Marriott Marquis,The best wifi available is in the lobby. Wifi in rooms suck and expensive.
New York Marriott Marquis,Wonderful place to stay right in the middle of Times Square!

New York Marriott Marquis,"A Times Square behemoth. The SceneThis 50-story hotel takes up an entire city block and has hunkered over Times Square since 1985. It's a glitzy chrome-and-aluminum amusement park complete with a revolving lounge, faux foliage and glass-enclosed elevators that zoom up and down at breakneck speeds. The 37-story-high atrium lobby is in itself a tourist attraction.The DetailsThe oversized accommodations are all surprisingly quiet and are labeled The Room that Works with their large console table with two power outlets, a PC modem jack, a moveable task light and an ergonomic chair. Upstairs rests The View, New York's only revolving rooftop restaurant and lounge. Other restaurant choices include a steakhouse, sushi bar, deli and casual cafe. If you want to ring in the New Year on Times Square, consider reserving for the Party Within a Party, the hotel's annual gala, complete with champagne, dinner, dancing, entertainment and a laser light show."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Best view of Times Square from above and inside of the 8th floor bar, which is on the hotel's lobby level. FYI that all window seats/tables are first come, first served with no staff oversight."
New York Marriott Marquis,"No free internet access and wifi in the rooms. You have to pay extra daily fee for the service. It,s very expensive."
New York Marriott Marquis,The elevators are pretty cool.

New York Marriott Marquis,Ask for Leslie' she was very helpful
New York Marriott Marquis,Visit the view lounge after 17:00 pm

New York Marriott Marquis,"Not all cracked up to be The Marriot may have had its hey day years before, but now its look is dated, the renovations do not match the aging decor and architecture, the elevators are a nightmare and the rooms are not all that. While its in the middle of everything, that can be a bad thing as well. Crowds and craziness make the location unbearable. The atrium is tall....ooooooo. Big woop."

New York Marriott Marquis,On the 8th floor great views and bar snacks
New York Marriott Marquis,Still fabulous r and has a great location.
New York Marriott Marquis,"Fabulous Hotel and Location Every time I come to New York I always stay at the Marriott Marquis Time Square. The hotel is located in a great part of the city (TIME SQUARE) and is near all the local attractions. Even though you are in the heart of the city you never hear the hustle and bustle from your room, which is very nice. The rooms are spacious and checking in is always fast and efficient. The rates may change depending on the time of year you visit, but it is well worth the extra money you had planned on spending. Great place, great location, great rooms, what more could you ask for!!!!"
New York Marriott Marquis,The 8th floor lobby just to kill time

New York Marriott Marquis,Great hotel right on The Square. New Reno in 2011.
New York Marriott Marquis,The glass elevators are amazing
New York Marriott Marquis,American cancer society breakfast
New York Marriott Marquis,"Great Times Square, theater district location!  There is a Starbucks on the 8th floor in the gift shop, great pastries and bagels are available there too."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Like a normal hotel on steriods If you are looking for quaint and cozy go somewhere else. But for everything you need only a few blocks from midtown highlights and theater - stay here. Typical Marriot blah rooms, but very large and clean. I had a 139 special and still had a view of Times Square, not a back wall - nice! Was supprisingly quiet in the room considering the location and all the activity in the atrium. Would hate to pay normal rates here (300+) but for the price I paid - you cant go wrong. All staff was very attentive and polite - supprising as there must have been thousands of quests when I was there - the hotel was sold out."
New York Marriott Marquis,2 starbucks in one place...heaven!
New York Marriott Marquis,"Bathroom's on the 8th floor, FYI"
New York Marriott Marquis,Great Place for a business meeting .
New York Marriott Marquis,Staying here for #nrf12
New York Marriott Marquis,If you eat at Crossroads get a table in the dining area as opposed to open couch area. We were seated by hostess in couch area and 15 mins no server came to table. Service in actual dining area fast.
New York Marriott Marquis,Great view from the gym
New York Marriott Marquis,Sweet time
New York Marriott Marquis,Scary how high the rooms are :)
New York Marriott Marquis,"Fantastic gym, looking at Broadway ave. Right there in timesquare!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Only the elevators on the outside of the elevator circle have glass enclosures that allow you to see out. Don't get stuck in one of the boring inside ones!
New York Marriott Marquis,"Went to a convention here, 8th floor has a lounge where you can charge up ur phone, decent restrooms in case ur in need! :-)"
New York Marriott Marquis,"Elevators, please! If you want some exercise using stairs stay here! The room was nice but they are installing new elevators and we won't stay there again until the installation is complete. The hotel advises leaving the room 1 hour prior to time for dinner or a play due to elevator delays and they mean it. The waits for an elevator could get long. There was no place to sit while waiting for transportation following check-out. 8th floor check in is quite inconvenient."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Avoid this hotel at all costs.  They have devised an elevator system that is so consistently unavailable, it defies description. Average wait in our week long stay ...15 minutes!!  Escaltors were broken during our visit.  Trapped, long-suffering guests were openly hostile about the system and we often overcrowded the lone elevator (2000 rooms) when our impatience trumped fear. Go ANYWHERE else!"
New York Marriott Marquis,A quick walk through the lobby is a great way to cool down on a hot day
New York Marriott Marquis,You cannot get the rooms quiet or dark enough to sleep. This may be a great place for tourists but if you are traveling for work the glass elevators don't make up for the lack of peace and service.
New York Marriott Marquis,Great bathroom stop
New York Marriott Marquis,Elevadores mais r��pidos e funcionais que j�� vi
New York Marriott Marquis,"Great stay! Wonderful location in the heart of Times Square and walking distance to all of the Theater District's attractions, accross the street from the 1/2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information. Service was unfailingly pleasant and efficient, rooms were spacious and surprisingly quiet given the location. We were given an automatic room upgrade upon check in simply because one was available. I highly recommend this hotel for business of pleasure."
New York Marriott Marquis,8th Floor restaurant and bar...and The View restaurant.
New York Marriott Marquis,The Starbucks downstairs doesn't take the app or have Trenta cups.
New York Marriott Marquis,Ride the glass elevators while humming Weapon of Choice
New York Marriott Marquis,Very kinds stuff with amazing service ����
New York Marriott Marquis,The revolving rooftop restaurant here is a definite must-try for its continental cuisine and amazing views.
New York Marriott Marquis,"great location, hate the elevators."
New York Marriott Marquis,Not many places to sit in the lobby.
New York Marriott Marquis,"OK if you are an Okie from Muskogee but... ...you will be extremely irritated by this mob scene of clueless tourists if you are a somewhat savvy traveler of large metropolitan cities. The GOOD: views from Times Square view rooms are decent. Bed is fairly comfortable. Staff tries like heck to help. Very good gym with great views. The BAD: room service food and menu selection, room decor and bathroom. The UGLY: elevator service is terrible. Those clueless tourists can't seem to understand this relatively simple elevator system and THAT causing most of the delays. The check-in is a zoo. And, of course, the ridiculous amount of fanny-packed tourists who can be heard complaining because they think they are staying in a 5 star hotel....LOL. Funny note: saw several Apprentice rejects step on the elevator and look disappointed when nobody acknowledged their minor celebrity. They didn't even merit a stay at Trump Int'l Hotel...."

New York Marriott Marquis,"Location,This hotel is right in the middle of Time Square - but the rooms are not anything special.a couple of rude staff when asking basic questions, first and last time for sure !"
New York Marriott Marquis,"For a quieter drink in the area, go to the bar on the 8th floor"
New York Marriott Marquis,"There for #icny? Have a hug, and a drink for me!"
New York Marriott Marquis,"Worst bar in NYC ! I just hate the bar on top - The View !!! Aside from the view that's fantastic, there's really nothing to it. The staff is very rude. I always get asked if I have 21 in the worst possible way. Last time my family dragged me there I had to listen to the waiter explain to my mom that there is alcohol in the strawberry margarita - like she was some kind of moron. Once you order you can NEVER get them to come again and unserve your plates or bring you something additional. The cocktails are nasty - too sugary and/or watery, tasteless. There's also no dress code and it seems like they let just about anyone in there. Bad place."
New York Marriott Marquis,Like this hotel very much.
New York Marriott Marquis,"The bar in the 8th floor the drinks are not strong at all, can barely taste the alcohol. So ask the bartender to add some more unless you like very fruity drinks!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Best lobby and very good lattes on 8th floor

New York Marriott Marquis,"Great place to live, right at the Times Square. Never plan on driving to the hotel, it is a nightmare to get past the pedestrians to the hotel valet. Also the parking is expensive ($55 a day)"
New York Marriott Marquis,Looking to kill a little time before your Broadway show? Head into the Marriott and ride the glass elevators all the way up and then all the way down. It's a blast!
New York Marriott Marquis,Don't shop at Pandora. The old man in there is THE most rude person in NY. Went in to shop and he cussed at me for saying I was just looking.  Will not spend a dime there.
New York Marriott Marquis,"My personal favorite It was really much more than I expected. Great service, very conveniently located, great food, and great price. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for a very luxurious stay, no matter how long, you have to stay here! You should see these elevators a great addition to this already enjoyable stay. Walk outside and see it all attractions for everybody, tourists and businessmen."
New York Marriott Marquis,"can't beat the location great hotel, great location. Rooms are cozy and quiet, and as weird as it sounds, the elevators are cool. You'll see what I mean when you're there. But the sushi bar is my favorite"

New York Marriott Marquis,"comfy and convenient We always enjoy our stays at the Marquis. The rooms are spacious,cheery, and comfortable. We need a handicapped room to meet my mom's needs.

New York Marriott Marquis,"I was staying at the Marriott Marquis this week for a business conference. I needed additional print-outs made and headed down to the business center where I met Sue, one of those rare, disarmingly fantastic customer service people. I encountered a whole mess of technical difficulties. Sue kept making suggestions for work arounds, she got quite busy at several different times and somehow still made everyone feel heard and taken care of. I would have been frustrated with me 15 minutes after I walked in and she was so incredibly patient not only with me, but with every person who came in. When I left she handed me my copies and said ""You poor thing, having to be up here for a whole hour!"" As if I wasn't being an incredibly persistent, irritating, technically challenged pain in the ass. I don't even want to call my experience there ""customer service"", because that somehow feels processed. It was human kindness. And at a really stressful time, Sue helped me figure my problem out in a way that made me feel like a friend, not a customer. Thank You!"
New York Marriott Marquis,Probably shouldn't tell everyone there's now an outdoor patio off the 8th floor ����.
New York Marriott Marquis,Don't use car service through concierge. Google car service and get your own rate. Quoted me at $130 one way and I called a car service on my own that charged me $40.
New York Marriott Marquis,"In the Middle of Times Square ok so the Marriott won't blow you away with world class service or fancy stuff. but you can't beat the location. smack dab in the middle of Times Square, the crossroads of the World. The Marquis has a theater right in the hotel so catch a show or simply walk across the street to the TKTS booth. again the location is great so stay here and you can see all of NYC and have a comfortable place to sleep. but again it's the city that never sleeps so just go out and party!!!!!!! lets go!!!!!!"
New York Marriott Marquis,"From the windows of Brecht, look up an to the left for the crazy scrolling scientologist sign!"

New York Marriott Marquis,The lobby ������
New York Marriott Marquis,"We loved staying at the Marriott Marquis.  The location is 2nd to none being right in the Heart of Times Square.  More than enough elevators to service the number of people using them.  The longest wait for an elevator was maybe 2 minutes.  Located very close to the many Broadway shows.  Many subway stations within a couple of blocks to take you anywhere in the city you want to go.  Sushi restaurant is fair.  Hotel Staff was very friendly and professional.  Molinda at the front desk was especially pleasant and friendly.  We loved her. Joey Tampa, Florida"

While its in the middle of everything, that can be a bad thing as well. Crowds and craziness make the location unbearable. The atrium is tall....ooooooo. Big woop."

The hotel is located in a great part of the city (TIME SQUARE) and is near all the local attractions. Even though you are in the heart of the city you never hear the hustle and bustle from your room, which is very nice. The rooms are spacious and checking in is always fast and efficient. The rates may change depending on the time of year you visit, but it is well worth the extra money you had planned on spending.

The GOOD:  views from Times Square view rooms are decent.  Bed is fairly comfortable.  Staff tries like heck to help.  Very good gym with great views. The BAD:  room service food and menu selection, room decor and bathroom. The UGLY: elevator service is terrible.  Those ""clueless tourists"" can't seem to understand this relatively simple elevator system and THAT causing most of the delays.  The check-in is a zoo.  And, of course, the ridiculous amount of fanny-packed tourists who can be heard complaining because they think they are staying in a 5 star hotel....LOL. Funny note:  saw several ""Apprentice"" rejects step on the elevator and look disappointed when nobody acknowledged their minor celebrity.  They didn't even merit a stay at Trump Int'l Hotel....?"
New York Marriott Marquis,"the credit physician had its meeting this month at marriott,wow the 750 club is amazing and we had 10 new home owners who we talked about,all credit due to the credit physician advantage program,what a nice place to have a event,its so nice to see first time home owners tell there credit celebration storys"
New York Marriott Marquis,In the heart of Times Square this place is really first class in all its aspects. From the service to the rooms to the revolving restaurant around NYC on the 66th floor.  The place is $$$ but you can tell exactly what you are paying for when you stay there.
New York Marriott Marquis,Very rude staff and overrun with wild children during the holidays.  I can deal with the kids but not the staff.
New York Marriott Marquis,Get a workout overlooking Times Square from the fitness center on the 23rd floor
New York Marriott Marquis,Best elevators ever.
New York Marriott Marquis,"A great spot in the heart of Times Square. Once you enter the building, you will be greeted and treated with excellent customer service. Your room will be your escape from the busy sounds of the great streets of NYC. Many conferences and company related events are held there - however - your needs are met at the moment of your requests."
New York Marriott Marquis,"When staying here, get a room facing north. You'll get the best view."
New York Marriott Marquis,Too much $$$
New York Marriott Marquis,They need to clean or change out and update their decor.
New York Marriott Marquis,Right in the heart of Times Square. Turn-by-Turn navigation will help guide you to the sights nearby!
New York Marriott Marquis,"It was really much more than I expected. Great service, very conveniently located, great food, and great price. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for a very luxurious stay, no matter how long, you have to stay here! You should see these elevators; a great addition to this already enjoyable stay. Walk outside and see it all; attractions for everybody, tourists and businessmen."
New York Marriott Marquis,"Love thy neighbor. If you don't know someone sitting next to you in a session, please introduce yourself."
New York Marriott Marquis,Great A/C and restrooms!
New York Marriott Marquis,"Great central Manhattan location. Clean, updated inside. Highly recommend you visit the bar on the top floor - the outside revolves around the middle, giving you a view of each side of the hotel within an hour. Recommend the Mojito's in July."
New York Marriott Marquis,Old fashioned bathrooms + the elevators are a disaster
New York Marriott Marquis,You can pay them money to stay in one of their rooms!
New York Marriott Marquis,"Awesome buffet, was truly worth the price."
New York Marriott Marquis,I've stayed at the Marquis twice in the last two years and the service has been wonderful.  I've found the rooms to be quite comfortable with all the necessary amenities.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Clean rooms,decent breakfast. Good for the price"
Best Western of Long Beach,Staying at this Best Western was wisest choice we made on our vacation. We booked here for the park and cruise package. The covered parking was a plus that we did not expect. The staff was incredible and patient with our questions and concerns. They went above and beyond the call when we forgot our cell phone in our room.... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Unfortunately not a good experience, a not very clean room nor bathroom, their beds and linens dirty and old. Not very friendly staff. Corridor's carpets old and unkempt, elevator very small and dirty, slow and unreliable. The price is too high for the service and room. 1-2 star review"
Best Western of Long Beach,This place was not that bad. The breakfast really made it so much better. The rooms could be a little updated but overall great place to lay my head and have awesome breakfast in the morning. Also stores close by and great Thai restaurant up the street and bakery next door.
Best Western of Long Beach,"The rooms were clean, free parking, and complimentary hot breakfast each morning. The price was reasonable, especially over the holiday weekend. There's an la metro stop right in front which is convenient to take to either downtown long beach or downtown la."
Best Western of Long Beach,sorta disappointing - not a nice area at all
Best Western of Long Beach,Great hotel
Best Western of Long Beach,"The beds are comfortable, room clean and breakfast good. Hallways are very hot and the elevator is very slow. Not in the best neighborhood. We decided to order in as opposed to going out due to the neighborhood. I'd stay at the BW near the convention center if I were to return to this area."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel did not have any kind of meat for breakfast. The website indicated that the hotel have breakfast included. First thing came to my mind when I read this was full breakfast. So I was expecting some scrambled eggs, not boiled eggs only, bacon, sausage. The fruit selection was just apples. The best thing out of the breakfast was... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"I came away with bed bug bites. Room smelled old mixed w/cigarette, bed was hard. Elevator didn't work in the morning. The staff were very professional and friendly."
Best Western of Long Beach,Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Even let us check in early. Hotel is a little dated which i didnt mind but there were red stains on the carpet and old coffee or soda spilled in places.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We were going on a cruise and wanted someplace that would store our car during the cruise. BW of Long Beach did that, the price was right and there shuttle service to and from the Cruise Port was great. I highly recommend this hotel."
Best Western of Long Beach,Using air conditioner caused the room to smell like urine. Breakfast was free but not good
Best Western of Long Beach,My stay was of one night and it was great. Room was nice size and comfortable with very clean bathroom. It did include a microwave and mini fridge which helped a lot with late night eats. The location itself was a bit sketchy but luckily there was indoor parking to help keep peace of mind. Overall my stay was great no issues for me.
Best Western of Long Beach,"My husband and I stayed here before going on a cruise. It was roomy and clean, and the bed was comfy. I had a tough time sleeping only because the pillows were too big. I'm sorry I didn't bring my own pillow. It wasn't in the best neighborhood since we like walking but it was fine. When we first went... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,The service was not exemplary. I was greatly disappointed.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I travel a lot and base my hotel on reviews. This hotel has received some good ones and I am not sure why. The location is poor to say the least, the hotel is below average and needs some updating at least my room needed new carpets, bedding and other amenities and the breakfast was very poor and limited choices....

Best Western of Long Beach,"The beds are very comfortable. Those beds can take a beating, if you know what I mean. ) But in all seriousness, the bathroom was very clean. You have a microwave, fridge, and a safe."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Very large rooms, nicely furnished. Elevator very slow though."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Room was clean, staff were entirely accommodating and helpful. Breakfast was very good except for the readi-eggs that most hotels serve for breakfast. Walls were thin, but most are. Staff (from front desk to housekeeping) were great! Some pointers: Rooms: clean, comfy, don't expect a Hilton because you paid for a Best Western Pool: smallish but clean with enough pool chairs Breakfast: 6-9:30, pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, coffee, tea, muffins, fruit, juice, oatmeal, cereal and more... wow! Location: In downtown, but in the a lower-income neighborhood Staff: totally helpful. hair dryer, directions, shuttle, free parking, wine opener, etc."
Best Western of Long Beach,We arrived back to the hotel after dinner to find the property in darkness due to an area wide power failure. Power stayed off for 12 hours. Stairways had no emergency lighting. Thank goodness we had a iPhone to provide room light as the front desk had nothing to offer. Our cruise was delayed for 1/2 day due to the... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"A very good budget hotel, everything exactly what you'd expect. Proximity to the metro station is a huge plus. In a rough neighbourhood but that's not an issue if you have a car or are taking the metro. Beds very nice (by any standard) and the pool was great to relax in. Would recommend as budget hotel. Staff probably bring... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"We had a great time everything was great, breakfast was awesome with great service, the only thing was the couch in room was dirty with urine."
Best Western of Long Beach,Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The room was basic but clean.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I was very irritated there were some very loud, obnoxious, and drunk hotel guest when I arrived in the lobby. They were so loud that I couldn't even here the lady checking me in. She not once asked them to quiet down. They were using profanity and I had my children with me. There was one elevator and it took forever to go up or down I mean 5 minutes minimum, it was absolutely ridiculous!"
Best Western of Long Beach,"Long Beach is a beautiful city, in its own way. It is rugged yet brimming with potential. As an aficionado of all things California, I enjoyed staying on the Long Beach Blvd and the Best Western was the ideal place to set up camp and explore the area. The bed was so comfortable and the room had everything one could need in terms of clean and furnished bedroom and bathroom. Would recommend."
Best Western of Long Beach,room was comfortable and made it restful.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I was there one night for business. The hotel seemed very dated and and in need of a deep clean. Even with that, I wouldn't stay there again being that the area was very rough at night. I didn't sleep at all due to the sirens and carrying on in front of the hotel."
Best Western of Long Beach,I stayed at Long Beach Best Western for 2 nights in January 2016. Highlights - 1) Clean remodeled rooms 2) Comfortable beds 3) Amazing breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Close to DTLB. I highly recommend this hotel to other travellers.
Best Western of Long Beach,Two night stay and no issues. Wifi was good and room comfortable and clean.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I stayed at the Best Western of Long Beach for 3 nights during Christmas and New Year. I had an amazing experience. The rooms are spacious, the beds are super comfortable and the staff is warm friendly. They recently changed their carpets, so the rooms have a fresh new feeling. The hotel is within 5 mins of tons... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"We hated it. Had to ask front desk to unlock pool. Very bad area, run down, trash and very scary. In one afternoon with-in 2 hours. We seen about 8 cop cars across the road arresting people. I would never stay there again. NEVER stay there. Staff was rude, I smoke and am handicap. We had to walk and stand either by the sidewalk or on the driveway. I took my 14 year old Granddaughter and she was so scared even in the day time. Are last 2 days were a waist."
Best Western of Long Beach,My brother in law came from out of town to help us redoing the bathroom and needed a place to stay and shower. The accomodations were just what we have aspected from Best Western. The breakfast was a full meal and we will continue to use the hotel system.
Best Western of Long Beach,"The beds were very comfortable, location very decent and safe, breakfast was great until the very end when we found a bed bug on our pillow. I took a picture and showed it to the manager who reimbursed my stay. Other than this experience, everything had been great value for the money."
Best Western of Long Beach,I enjoyed my stay there
Best Western of Long Beach,It was great. We always stay here.
Best Western of Long Beach,"So-so, wouldn't stay again."
Best Western of Long Beach,One of the few times I regretted my stay
Best Western of Long Beach,My wife and I have stayed here a couple times taking advantage of their Star and cruise package. We leave our car in their underground lot for the week and use the shuttle to and from the port. All around a great experience both times.
Best Western of Long Beach,Just be aware that the train station is in front of this hotel and some of the homeless will be sleeping near the entrance of the hotel at night. We did not venture out at night. During check in we noticed that the door to the onsite parking was wide open and did not have any type of exclusion to... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"One night stay was pleasant. Check in customer service was friendly and pleasant. However, under main amenities Free airport shuttle should be moved. Airport shuttle wasn't free it was chargeable per person. Main amenities info misrepresented."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The stay was pretty good! I wasn't there much as I spent most of my time with friends, but I loved the room. My only drawback was the lack of hot water from the sink. It didn't matter how long I had it running, I couldn't get hot water. Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay there..."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Nice place to stay! It is as clean and even though there were some loud noises in the hall, it was quiet in our room. Nice pool."
Best Western of Long Beach,My husband and I recently stayed here one night prior to our Carnival cruise out of the Long Beach cruise terminal. We opted for the park and cruise package. With this we were able to leave our car here in a secure parking lot while we went on our cruise. The hotel provided shuttle service to and from the cruise... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Poor breakfast. Not very clean rooms. Dirty under the bed and all around the room corners. To high price for the location and service provided.
Best Western of Long Beach,Room is bigger than we expected . Location though not the most enticing . But the food was great . Only one elevator for whole hotel.
Best Western of Long Beach,Noisy streetcar running all night. Ceiling creaking from person walking like an elephant above. TV couldn't tune into any channel. The alarm radio kept buzzing when my phone was near it. Phone gets priority on night stand.. moved the alarm away. Elevator starts to move even when door is open.. I ended up taking the stairs.. didn't want to risk getting stuck. Towels are cheap. Ripped a bit of the towel just drying off after a shower without even trying.. breakfast was alright. Nothing to really write about. Neighborhood isn't too great but that's LBC for ya.
Best Western of Long Beach,Horrible. I have to cancel my remaining night to a better hotel
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed at Best Western Long Beach for one night while waiting for a flight from LAX. the hotel is dated but clean. We spent time at the pool, and ordered dinner in. As others have mentioned the neighborhood is rather rundown so we didn't want to be out walking after dark. Breakfast was great."
Best Western of Long Beach,We were attracted to the Best Western of Long Beach because of their stay and park special for cruises where you can stay a night but leave your car safely parked in their garage for the duration of your cruise (assuming your port is Long Beach). The price was good and the rooms were clean and well taken care of.... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"I had a great experience staying at this best Western in long Beach, the workers were very helpful."
Best Western of Long Beach,"This was my second visit to the Best Western of Long Beach to take advantage of the package to leave the car there while we went on a cruise. Overall, it's probably along the same level as most other Best Western Hotels. I don't like trying to drive from Las Vegas to Long Beach on the day of a cruise,... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Great place to stay if you are going on a cruise ship. Secure parking while you are at sea and a shuttle to and from the pier. Also great breakfast and a friendly staff. A straight shot down the boulevard to downtown Long Beach.
Best Western of Long Beach,"When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The stay was okay, but the hotel is in a terrible location. Had I not had a non-can prepaid reservation I would have cancelled as soon as I saw the location."
Best Western of Long Beach,"the hotel wasn't close to the beach but perfect location, along the same street from the Greyhound bus, directly across from the metro train. For a 1 for thenTap Card and 1.75 each way this will take you directly to downtown and to the front and shops. Nice big room, very clean (not the nicest of views but who cares... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,it was too noisy !!you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room

Best Western of Long Beach,"We chose this hotel because it had a free shuttle from the Airport and to the Cruise Port. Our room was in the second floor and in the back. (Don't choose the front because the street is very noisy). The hotel is well maintained, and has a beautiful swimming pool. For breakfast they serve juices, fruits, waffles, pancakes, hard boiled...

Best Western of Long Beach,"Super friendly and helpful staff. Room was ready early, which was a great help since we were turning in a car. We were going on a cruise, and the driver took us early.

Best Western of Long Beach,"If you are thinking of staying here, !!DON'T!! Rude employees and owner doesn't care. And if you happened to get stuck here by Priceline name your own price then, well you'll figure it out yourself!"
Best Western of Long Beach,"This was my second time staying at Best Western of Long Beach and i had a wonderful time ,my checking in was quick and the staff were very professional .I was disappointed that the shuffle service they offer on line ended at 4.30pm and if you booked from a 3rd. party they will not pick you up at the Airport .My room was very comfortable and spacious with a refrigerator and microwave.Breakfast provided a good variety of items hot and cold .The neighborhood looks rough but i like living around the people and never felt unsafe during my seven nights at the Hotel .Never got to use the pool it was just too cool outside but i took advantage of the Gym and enjoyed it all .Thanks to the Staff once again for helping me to enjoy my stay at Best Western of Long Beach ."
Best Western of Long Beach,Not what we were expecting. Decent place to stay between A and B but not recommended for a long stay. Staff ended up being accommodating after some issues and overall happy with our stay here.
Best Western of Long Beach,BW Long Beach is an average hotel in a rundown neighborhood. It shows evidence of updates and is clean. On June 24th I checked in and was informed that the elevator was not working. They offered to help with the baggage. That wasn't a problem. The problem for my wife and I was climbing the stairs to the 4th floor.... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Quick check-in, clean room, nice breakfast, but the neighborhood was just terrible. My friend went out to store and on the way a grou of people let him know in a sign language that they'd like to slit his throat."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The area is not so good but you can drive literally a few blocks down to be in a better area. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. They accommodated an early check in for me, which I appreciated. All in all, good deal for the price."
Best Western of Long Beach,wi-fi password: best west - via 4sqwifi.com
Best Western of Long Beach,"Booked last minute, did not read reviews. The Hotel itself was fine but not being from the area and seeing the name of town called called Long Beach you think it was ok. I was told downtown had decent places to eat and found none, just fast food stores, closed up businesses and many people hanging out on streets asking for money. If you stay here make sure you eat before checking in or have someone who knows the area take you out to eat. The hotel was fine I had no issues with it, don't misunderstand me, the location of it was an issue."
Best Western of Long Beach,"This motel was perfect for anyone on a budget. Rooms are updated, the beds were extremely comfortable, parking is easy and the staff is friendly. About a 5 minute drive to the aquarium. Only downside is the surrounding area is a bit sketchy, but I will book again next year when I'm in Long Beach."
Best Western of Long Beach,Very average. I wasn't murdered in my sleep- a good thing
Best Western of Long Beach,"friendly staff, good breakfast, lots of parking space and very happy with our accommodation."
Best Western of Long Beach,"We loved the hotel. We booked it for the night before our cruise, without knowing the proximity to the cruise terminal - we were excited to know it was so close. We really liked the hotel and the included breakfast and the secluded parking. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean - you couldn't ask for more."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I feel strongly that the hotel staff should be advising visitors of the location environment and that cabbing is recommended if going out at night. Although the quality of this Best Western was most satisfactory, and its location desirable, it is located in a very sketchy area of town. It is right across from the train station, which was convenient... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Very basic hotel in not so nice part of Long Beach
Best Western of Long Beach,Staff was very nice and accommodating neighborhood not that great floors in bathroom not clean more than 1 day

Best Western of Long Beach,"Hotel staff courteous - rooms were large, clean and nicely decorated. Shuttle offered to cruise ship. Had outside pool. Breakfast room offered a great light breakfast and fruit. Hot and cold foods as well as fruit. Stores within walking distance and train stop right outside. Would stay here again."
Best Western of Long Beach,This hotel was not luxurious at all but the staff went above and beyond to make our stay great. They were so accommodating and friendly it was refreshing. The surrounding area is a little dicey but uber and cabs were a cheap 5 min ride to downtown.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We came in a day early to catch a cruise. The hotel offered free airport shuttle and also took us to the terminal for free and on time. Both drivers were awesome but the neighborhood a little shady. Public bus right outside the hotel took us to port area, room and hotel clean overall a GREAT stay"

Best Western of Long Beach,Great option for attending a meeting at the Hyatt conference center. Hotel price was just right and there is a free shuttle during the hours of 7:00 AM and 4:30 PM. Martin and Marco were very nice and professional.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I booked this hotel because it was the cheapest well-known hotel. My reserved room was ready: the room was spacious, clean, had all the amenities that I needed. The hotel offered breakfast from 6-9 AM. Also, it has a small gym that opened from 6 am-10pm. I enjoyed my stay here and definitely reserve again if it continues to offer 100 dollar per a night."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Everything was great including staff but the entire hotel especially the rooms needed a deep carpet cleaning or better replace. Clean white socks were black after five minutes in room. Elevator was extremely slow and safety on door was broke, so as you were entering/exiting door would close even when blocked with luggage or kid !"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The area did not feel safe, baths ink sink was clogged, and the front door did not lock."
Best Western of Long Beach,Rooms are comfortable and breakfast is great!!! Joann and Shawn are fantastic and always friendly and helpful. Favorite place to stay in Long Beach.
Best Western of Long Beach,Not a safe neighborhood to walk in. It was near the harbor and Catalina Express.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I was impressed with the upgraded room! The bathroom was nice and clean!!!! Area was not so great. But right in front of a light rail, so we took that to downtown! Complimentary breakfast was decent. Lots of selections. Id definitely stay there again."
Best Western of Long Beach,only complaint was room coffee maker made a very weak cup. Full breakfast coffee was delicious.Location isn't the best as the rail is across the street and runs most of the night. Did have a drainage of water problem when using shower and when advised staff this was taken care of fast.
Best Western of Long Beach,As you drive through the area you don't get a great feeling but the hotel itself felt safe and friendly. Staff was great and so was breakfast the following morning. Great for a night or two stay with the family.
Best Western of Long Beach,Will not stay again
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel was a bit small, but close enough to where I had to go. Staff was friendly and we checked in before 3:00 pm."
Best Western of Long Beach,All went well. I felt it was a little too pricey for the neighhood but doable.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Read online hotel was recently renovated, but my room only has the shower wall, shower head, and bathroom floor replaced. Everything else in room still the same. Very old furniture. Room is good size. Only 1 very slow elevator. Hotel staff was friendly and cleaning staff did a good job every day. Plenty of parking but did filled up at night. For the price, it was an acceptable stay."
Best Western of Long Beach,the room was a nonsmoking room but it stunk like smoke.

Best Western of Long Beach,The carpets were dirty. The hotel smelled like marijuana. If I could have found another hotel and not been charged for my stay I would have left...sleeping in your car would have been better. Would not recommend.

Best Western of Long Beach,Nice hotel and a easy drive to the beach. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Spent most of the time at the beach area and had a great time. Many restaurants and things to do on shoreline drive.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Is located in a bad area of town. The front desk treated me like I was bothering them, not like a welcome guest. The room is big and comfortable. Like may other places, the AC will be off when you walk in your hot room. Take a walk in the parking area to allow cooling or be ready for some sweating sauna style."
Best Western of Long Beach,Reserved double room and upon arrival was told they would have to unlock extra room. Was told it would be about 10 minutes.

This place is good location if your cruising like we where and only for a day or two.Not much around near to see unless you don't mind taking the rail or buses around.The shuttle driver we had was great Martin does a great job, very friendly."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I stay at this Best Western whenever I cruise out of Long Beach, it is very convenient. I love the shuttle they provide to the pier, and the ability to park the car there during the cruise. I also like the continental breakfast and the free WiFi. This hotel was also recently renovated."
Best Western of Long Beach,On arrival at the hotel we couldn't find the entrance which cost me extra in cab fare. Very poorly marked. Breakfast was very crowded and no place to sit. We asked for a transfer to the cruise terminal the night of check in and was told to ask in the morning and everything would be OK. The next morning I... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Very comfortable, but kinda expensive for location."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel is not a quality Best Western. It is very old and appears to be getting a face lift. which will not be enough to make this a nice hotel. The rooms are very out dated, the colors are from the '70s and the beds and pillows are uncomfortable. The bathroom counter is about 2 1/2 feet high. The... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Seven of us stayed at two rooms at this hotel in Long Beach. We were treated very well and breakfast was plentiful and a lot of variety. We booked on Booking .com and it had stated a free shuttle from the airport. Unfortunately hotel only does shuttle until 5 PM and our flight got in at 8:45 so we had... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Stayed one night and visited the aquarium the next day. Nice property and the room was nice. Only issue was the pillows were awful. The lumpiest pillows (all 4 of them) I've ever had in a hotel and I travel a lot.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Rooms are nice and spacious, seems to be clean enough. Bed is bad. Front desk people are nice. Free parking, free wifi and free breakfast. Remember free doesn't mean good quality. Wifi is slow, breakfast is ok. I ll stay here again If I get an awesome deal or I wont bother."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I really enjoyed my hotel stay. The train stop is across for the hotel so you don't need a car when visiting if you want to Hollywood Blvd. and hangout. The bus stop is directly across the street and you can take that to the beach. Little convenient stores are in the area and you can walk there. I had a rental for two days only and the other days I caught the public transportation. I was mixed minded about that because my purpose was to site see but I did good within those two days. The neighborhood is not a bad neighborhood. The breakfast at the hotel was OK and decent. The hotel is very clean. My sofa bed wouldn't unfold out but that was OK, my son slept with me. I would definitely stay here again but I would rather be closer to all the action places in Hollywood since that was my purpose."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I booked a room through Hotwire's Hot rate, the hotel was not disclosed but was rated a 3 star at a good price but when we arrived we found it was barely a 2 star hotel in the worst location ever, it was an unsafe crime ridden area. No wonder this hotel was not disclosed upfront, no one would stay... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"if you are thinking of staying here, !!don't!! rude employees and owner doesn't care. and if you happened to get stuck here by priceline name your own price then, well you'll figure it out yourself!"
Best Western of Long Beach,The shuttle service was great. Staff is very responsive and friendly. They have free breakfast including make your own pancakes and waffles. They have a underground parking garage and outdoor pool. The room had a refrigerator and microwave.
Best Western of Long Beach,"The service for park cruise was great. Got us to the ship in a timely manner and picked us up quickly, did not have to wait long. The breakfast was good. The location is iffy, I would not go out wandering around after dark. Felt comfortable leaving the car since they had good security."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel is in a good location but there aren't many restaurants within walking distance. Martin, the shuttle bus driver, was excellent. He picked us up from a Catalina excursion after the shuttle hours were over. We rate him a 10."
Best Western of Long Beach,"While definitely not in the best neighborhood, it does provide free off-street parking. There are no restaurants in the immediate area except for fast food. When I inquired information on near-by restaurants, other than fast food the desk clerk could only recommend going down to the entertainment district near the convention center. The beds were comfortable and I heard no... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"I knew the hotel was not going to be in the best location due to reading the other reviews. However we booked anyways, because the price was right. The staff was very friendly! No problems or issues there. The hotel consist of mainly party, college, younger people. ( we were there on a tuesday and Wednesday) which we were fine... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,it was a nice stay
Best Western of Long Beach,"We spent two nights, enjoyed the breakfast each morning, and then were taken to our cruise and picked up by Best Western's shuttle van. The parking is indoors and very efficient in the delivery and pickup. We would utilize them again. The hotel is being remodeled, and in a few months will look like new on the inside!"
Best Western of Long Beach,"I STAYED HERE AS the closest to the convention center available at the last minute for a conference at the convention center. Room was clean and confortable, shuttle took me to and from the convention center. Leos was the driver and also manages several operations at the hotel, very friendly and courteous. He was helpful and recommended a place to... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Clean and comfortable. Nice breakfast in the morning. Great overnight stop on your way to Long Beach Airport! Not sure about staying for several days unless you have things to do in the area. Very close to convention center and seaport area.
Best Western of Long Beach,Comfy accommodations- would stay here again. The lobby furniture is a bit out of place. However the rooms are a good size and the beds comfortable. Breakfast options are decent.
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel was nice and clean. Associates were professional and helpful. However, I was in a non-smoking room, but I am not sure if I was on a non-smoking floor. The 4th floor smells like smoke. I stayed 2 nights for a conference and needed a ride to the convention center. I used the hotel's shuttle service. Martin is both... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"A good (somewhat dated) 3-star hotel, with clean, spacious and fairly quiet rooms (in the back, at least) although the A/C makes a bit of noise. The staff at the reception is friendly and courteous. Standard continental breakfast was included. The elevator might require a bit of patience, even when the hotel is not at full capacity, because it is... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,This property is an excellent hotel for my family. The location is easy to find right off the freeway exit and very close to the cruise terminal. Staff are friendly and room is clean. Plenty of breakfast food. We will definitely come back.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We were provided shuttle service to and from the hotel.The driver-Martin was both professional and congenial.We weren't too hungry,but did avail ourselves to a portion of the breakfast snacks.The beds were comfortable except for the pillows-each bed had four quite thick pillows.Perhaps a combination of thick and thin pillows would be more likely to satify everone. We were there on... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"We took advantage of the Park and Sail package - one night stay and left car in underground parking for 7 days. The room was good, clean, and quiet. The continental breakfast was much more than expected and the shuttle service to and from the cruise terminal was soooo easy. All this included in the one-night price! Cordial stall, clean... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"We use the park and cruise service, and love it. Martin is a great shuttle driver. We'll do it again. Breakfast was good ,nice staff had a great had a good time. Price of parking at the Port almost makes the hotel free."
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed here for 9 nights and we had no complaints at all. We found staff to be very friendly and helpful and very accommodating, particularly on our last day when I ran into a bit of a problem, they really helped out. When we arrived, our bed seemed quite disheveled and I wondered if someone had sat or lay... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,To me nice people and friendly
Best Western of Long Beach,This Best Western is in an older section of town directly across from a public transportation train stop. Not as nice as the hotel provided picture make it look. Good value but away from all of the Long Beach attractions.
Best Western of Long Beach,After a long journey warm and welcoming staff was like an oasis in the desert. Front desk was so helpful that I couldn't have asked for a better welcome. The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was warm and gave us a great start everyday. Had a wonderful experience. Would recommend to everybody coming this side.
Best Western of Long Beach,Stayed before cruise. It was nice and staff was very helpful. Clean rooms was a plus. We were happy with stay. Would recommend staying there. Swimming pool was nice.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We made a Quick weekend trip to Long Beach for the Grand Prix races. Hotels were booked, so we booked at a hotel that I said I'd never stay at again. Close to the races, but this is a 2 star hotel in a undesirable location. The races were great, the hotel was not."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Excellent service and breakfast. Not a good neighborhood, but the free shuttle was very helpful."
Best Western of Long Beach,"really great place to stay for a good price, will surely come back again!"
Best Western of Long Beach,Outstanding breakfeast!
Best Western of Long Beach,Nice and clean!
Best Western of Long Beach,This is an ideal hotel to stay before a Cruise. They provide free Shuttle service from the Airport as well as to the cruise terminal. Parking is available too. Excellent value for the money. Friendly and courteous staff. We would stay again in the future and would be glad to recommend to friends and family.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Nice, clean, recently renovated room. Pretty good breakfast. Friendly staff. A bit sketchy of a location."
Best Western of Long Beach,Hotel was nice and clean. The people super nice. We stayed here for two nites while waiting for our cruise ship. It was easy to get around and we walked around long beach quite easily. Great place to stay if you have a couple of days to stay before your cruise ship leaves.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed here before going on a cruise in September. The hotel is very close to the pier. We found the room spacious and comfortable, no problem. The breakfast was nice and the breakfast room was very clean. We only drink decaf coffee and were quickly taken care of, with a smile. There was a problem with the vending machines... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"adequate but too high priced for what you receive. The location is noisy, there were public address speakers blairing to people either on the property or near same. Parking is atrocious, especially in the underground garage. the access/egress is very tight and dangerous. some mirrors should be installed to prevent potential accidents."
Best Western of Long Beach,Geared up for visitors traveling through. Everything is just about OK but not necessarily a pleasure. They provide just enough to get by and it is very clean but with a few changes they could make it much more inviting and satisfying.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Breakfast was great! Location was not so good. However, if you're looking for a hotel to stay the night near the port then i would recommend this hotel."
Best Western of Long Beach,shower curtain drips water on the nearby floor. have to mop up the water every time we use shower. very inconvenient. elevator is so slow and jerky. room cleaner brings giant cart on elevator leaving little space for guests on same elevator.
Best Western of Long Beach,Did not expect tree trimming in Sunday's morning at 7am outside my third floor window. Since when can I not pay with cash. Otherwise great stay. Close to everything
Best Western of Long Beach,"Great service. Smile, say please, and dont be an ass, and the employees treat you just as nice. Best BW I've used in a while! Local area needs work, not a great neighborhood."
Best Western of Long Beach,we picked this hotel because it was near the court house that we needed to be the next day. the hotel is not in a good area. you don't want to eat or walk outside of the hotel. the rooms are very nice and comfortable and the parking is safe.
Best Western of Long Beach,I must admit I was very skeptical of this hotel given the numerous negative reviews. After arriving at the hotel my fears were taken away. My flight landed early so I arrived at 8:30. The nice receptionist let me have an early check in. The hotel is very very dated but its clean and the rooms are very spacious. The... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Pleasant stay, nice breakfast, and kept car safe while we cruised! There was a large group or us and it worked out nice. They shuttled us all. There were stores close by, but bars on window, so didn't know how safe the area was. But we didn't have any issues."
Best Western of Long Beach,Stay and sail very convenient. You stay 1 night and you can park your car for the whole week. Free Breakfast very good. Shuttle to and from the Carnival terminal very good. Location very convenient to some great restaurants right on the harbor
Best Western of Long Beach,Great location near the cruise ship terminal. Great quality in Best Western
Best Western of Long Beach,"Very helpful and professional staff, clean and tidy rooms, comfortable bed, all we needed for our one night stay, the free shuttle was a bonus getting to the long beach airport, would definitely stay again."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I was a little worried when I read the reviews especially about the area the hotel was in but I had no problems and did not feel uneasy there. Having been on a long road trip in California I spent my last night here. On arrival there was complementary coffee, cookies and chilled water flavoured with orange which a nice... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"I was truly impressed as this was my first time visiting. The facilities were clean, the staff were very helpful and friendly. I loved the large rooms and large bathrooms. They facilities were very impressive to say the least. The continental breakfast was great and there was plenty of variety, delicious. I look forward to visiting again."
Best Western of Long Beach,"cable channels were good, good location, and I had to extend my stay and it was not a problem. Nice selection at breakfast. The staff was accommodating if you needed it, otherwise they left you alone. There is a shuttle that you can take to the Long Beach Harbor, though I had a rent a car it was still nice... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel women at check in was great, very pleasant and helpful. The only actual negative from our stay was the shower didn't drain."
Best Western of Long Beach,"This is a great location to Park and Cruise they offer underground parking for your car while you are on your cruise, and the accommodations are exactly what you need. Its clean, they offer breakfast, and modern. It was nothing over the top and just perfect for a one night stay prior to my cruise departure. I would stay here... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The breakfast was great! But if they could add some chocolate sprinkles so you can make chocolate chip waffles, that would be fantastic.

The pool was clean and surprisingly free of bugs at... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed here the night before our cruise, and took advantage of the park-and-cruise package. The hotel, pool, and breakfast were all very nice.

Also, they provide secure parking in an underground garage for... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"After much research this appeared to be the best value for our cruise out of Long Beach. A park and cruise package, shuttle to and from the cruise port and hot breakfast.

Best Western of Long Beach,"We would highly recommend this hotel for a number of reasons but if you are cruising out of the Long Beach port, you can't beat the package that the Long Beach Best Western offers.

Best Western of Long Beach,The room was nice large and very clean. As was the common areas. Check in was a bit tiring but I guess that is to be expected with a group. The parking is extremely tight so if you have a large vehicle proceed with caution. The hotel is surrounded by a less than desirable neighborhood but is minutes away from... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Staff uninterested in having to wait till 3pm for check in. They could've made an exception for early check in when checking out was 1130am.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Martin, the van driver and maintenance supervivor, assisted me in navigating the complex system of public transportation in Long Beach. The hotel is in a run-down neighborhood, but the hotel itself is nice and a good value."
Best Western of Long Beach,We took advantage of the park and cruise package (stay the night before your cruise and leave your car there for up to a week). The staff was very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was fine. It was nice to park our car in their covered parking while we were gone for a week. The ride to and from... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Pretty nice place. Its not in the best part of town but it has a parking garage and the car was fine. Breakfast again was ok but the room was very clean and comfortable. The only real problem was there was no hot water. I dont know if they were having a problem or not but the water was cold... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Very nice. Stayed there for 7 nites. Price is right, room was very clean, staff was friendly. They have a very nice breakfast buffet daily. Property itself could probably use a refurbishment, but overall we thought it was a really good value for the price."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Delighted. The rates are affordable. They will drop you off and pick you up from nearby attractions, in my case, the ferry to and from Catalina Island. The included breakfast is not gourmet but a definite step up from Continental. A big bonus with this hotel is you can arrange to safely park your vehicle there while you are away... More"

Best Western of Long Beach,We found this hotel to be very clean and comfortable. Due to our reward status we were upgraded to a suite and found the room to be great!

Best Western of Long Beach,"Our room was upgraded to a 1 BR suite. Hotel was clean and we had a quiet restful night.

Best Western of Long Beach,Staff was courteous and allowed us to check in earlier than expected. Nice breakfast - enjoyed the pool.
Best Western of Long Beach,"02/17/2016 The staff of this hotel is totally unprofessional. We checked into this hotel on 2/14/16 for 2 nights. We were out the whole day on 2/15 and returned around midnight. That's when our ordeal began. First of all, there was power outage by the time we came. Of course its not their fault! But the staff was totally unprepared... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"OMG!!! Worst place to stay... BAD SERVICE. The power was out the day we left from 7:30 am to NOON. Didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big deal. However, the king size bed we had, there was like a hole or something in it when you sat at the end of the bed you fell off like there was nothing underneath the mattress. It smelt like straight sewage when you ran the water in the bath room as well as in the shower. The neighborhood is NOT GOOD at all. Not safe. Hotel sits in the middle of auto body and junk yards, train is out front and you hear police helicopters and sirens all night long. ONLY great thing is their breakfast."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The guests in the room on the upper floor could be heard in the evening and in the morning. The sound of their walking, packing, and water from the shower."
Best Western of Long Beach,"This was a very nice, well-maintained, and well-appointed motel in a great location for visiting the Los Angeles area attractions. It is convenient to major traffic arteries and several forms of public transportation."

Best Western of Long Beach,"This hotel is great for acommodating people to board the ships nearby. It is great for leaving your car while on the ship also. Not in the best part of town, but sure is convenient. They serve a hot breakfast and the beds are very comfortable."
Best Western of Long Beach,The hotel wasn't too bad but the location was horrible. The neighborhood didn't seem safe and there was a bunch of tagging. The one good thing was they lock the parking area at night.
Best Western of Long Beach,Very happy with our stay. Great value.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Can't park there for cruise parking unless you purchase the package directly from hotel for hotel stayed and cruise parking. Otherwise, even if you offered to pay daily parking while on your cruise, they rudely refused it."
Best Western of Long Beach,not what we were expecting. decent place to stay between a and b but not recommended for a long stay. staff ended up being accommodating after some issues and overall happy with our stay here.

Best Western of Long Beach,"Very bad location, 'ghetto' - pool is visible to the street which is also next to a train station- lots of random people roaming the streets. The room had a very bad odor and the staff was not very helpful trying to get us the best rate for a 10 hour stay."
Best Western of Long Beach,"We were extremely satisfied with the hotel, The continental breakfast was outstanding and everyone was nice. We would espetially like to mention Katherine on the front desk who went above and beyond to help us out. Also Martin head of housekeeping and sometime shuttle driver was most pleasant and helpful' We will be heading back to Long Beach next year... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Generally a good value with very pleasant staff. Very typical Best Western layout. Clean and comfortable bed. Only annoying thing was all the wall mounted soap and shampoo dispensers were mostly clogged and would not really dispense.
Best Western of Long Beach,We bought one night in advance of NCL cruise. Was told at airport by Officer not to leave Hotel at night due to risky area.

Best Western of Long Beach,"The staff was great but the room was generally in bad shape. For the area, which is rough, the hotel fit right in...know what I mean Won't stay here again."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I've stayed here several times in the last few years, and have always been pleased. Since I was here in November, 2015, they've experienced many upgrades that make the experience of being here even better. The breakfast buffet is beyond expectations, with scrambled eggs and sausage along with the usual pancakes, waffles, cereal, etc. They are still finishing up the changes to the rooms, hallways, lobby, etc. and each day you can see these updates now in place. I certainly look forward to coming back in a few months and seeing the final changes."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Nice, clean, don't take a room to the front of the Hotel, you have the noise of the train, and the street traffic. Cant be out walking when the sun goes down to many homeless on the street. Breakfast was good, and the staff was quick to clean any mess, the front desk was very helpful."
Best Western of Long Beach,"I wanted a clean, safe hotel with wifi and parking that wasn't too expensive and this worked out just fine. The room was much bigger than I would have expected and the TV worked great (and it automatically shut off after a while when I fell asleep with it on, which is always useful). The parking lot can be a bit difficult to access, but that's not too surprising for a downtown hotel. I was glad they had free parking at all."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The front desk guy was rude. The room was clean. No rollaway beds, so don't bother asking. The breakfast was okay, not great, but not terrible. Martin the shuttle driver was super helpful nice. Overall, I've stayed in worse places. I'd stay again."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The room was filthy, stained sheets, no other rooms available slept with my clothes on. Power outrage no emergency lights for hallway, staff had no flash lights. Moved next day room was acceptable. This was a business trip 2 other associates also stated rooms were not that clean. Staff were OK, exterior and pool were OK. Not a safe location... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Though the hotel was OK the area it was in was not to our liking.
Best Western of Long Beach,We stayed at this hotel one night before our cruise out of Long Beach and it was perfect for what we needed. Excellent location and the staff was very nice. The shuttle to and from the port made our trip so relaxing and our car was kept safe in the underground garage. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!
Best Western of Long Beach,I was in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room. My friend selected this hotel through Expedia. I arrived a day before her and was alone the first night. My king bed room was gross. There was a large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty. The second room with 2 queens... More

Best Western of Long Beach,"This should be barely be hanging on to Best Western title, as it was NOT what I am accustom to as a Best Western Plus traveler. It was run down, dirty, the elevator was broken, and there are only rooms on upper floors, none on the entry floor. It is across the street from a train station, so, there was... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,OK for cheap. Hallway smelled of smoke. View was of the a/c parapet. Bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean. Didn't like the area and was told later at a restaurant that it was a 'seedy' part of town. We only stayed one night.
Best Western of Long Beach,Love having breakfast and how comfortable the hotel is!
Best Western of Long Beach,"Overnighted before getting one a cruise. Martin shuttled us downtown and was very helpful in showing options to eat at and how to get back to the hotel on the train. Not really any place to eat close to the property so you need to go downtown or to the waterfront to eat. Price was good. Hotel was very clean,... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The elevator worked very slowly. The door did not open when it should have. There was no ventilation in the elevator or hallways. Three stairwells opened to the street, with no security locks. The neighborhood had transients that could have entered the building at any time."
Best Western of Long Beach,The room was ok. Carpet had stains and was dirty. Lobby was not like pictures on line reflected at all. Ok for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days. Front desk per personnel kind of dry.
Best Western of Long Beach,Get an inside room away from the street / otherwise great place and breakfast was good. Lots of selection. Perfect for visiting of preping fro a cruise. Enjoyed the light rail right next to the place so you didn't have to use your car.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Short stay (2 nights) to attend industry trade show BWLB is a conveniently located property, well kept, clean, great service, plentiful parking... plus a value rate (for the area).

Best Western of Long Beach,Perfect hotel if you are leaving from the Long Beach cruise terminal. Comfortable and the staff is super nice. Delicious continental breakfast...more than just pastries.
Best Western of Long Beach,Complimentary shuttle to / from both Long Beach Airport and Cruise Terminal in San Pedro. Many dinig options with 2 blocks.
Best Western of Long Beach,"This hotel has nice staff but did not inform anyone till they arrived that the hotel was under major construction. They said that on their website it said it will be under construction for 6 months. Also there is only 1 elevator for this whole hotel, fast but all the workers were using it too. Breakfast wasn't bad and they... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"Best Western is located close to Long Beach Blvd and PCH just next to a train station. The surrounding doesnt look very great but the hotel is pretty neat and provides comfortable stay for a couple. They have a good covered parking, which is very assuring for the area. The complimentary breakfast was good."
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed at this Best Western because they will shuttle you to the cruise ship. We were shocked at how nice the room was, and the breakfast a nice bonus. Our shuttle driver Martin was great . We called to be picked up and he was prompt, courteous, and very friendly."
Best Western of Long Beach,"We stayed here specifically for the location between the airport and the cruise terminal. The free shuttle to the cruise terminal in the morning was quite helpful but only runs twice, 11am and 1pm. There was a laundromat right across the street that was great doing our laundry before boarding. The breakfast in the morning is the usual fare -... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"This hotel was rated three stars, but we would definitely give it more. Yes, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but the hotel itself, the parking and the pool, are perfectly secure. There is a streetcar station just outside the door, which takes one quickly and economically to the beautiful downtown and waterfront areas of Long Beach. Easy access to... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,It was a good place to stay as the train stopped right outside and would take you closer to the action. Breakfast was ordinary as our many American continental breakfasts. Room was comfortable as you would expect.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Great staff, very friendly. Esay check in/out. Comfortable bed and nice big bathroom. Neighborhood is real sketchy,wouldn't walk alone especially at night. Metro across the street so you have access to public transportation to take you anywhere. Security cameras in parking areas and by pool."
Best Western of Long Beach,"The fitness room was great! The staff is so helpful and professional. Martin the housekeeping supervisor and shuttle driver was the most friendly, willing to help with directions, and customize our group's needs on where to drop us off at the convention center. Would come back again because of the service he performed and the easy transportation to and from... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Hotel staff were great. We also received a crib for my 6 month old for free. breakfast was awesome. would recommend. thanks
Best Western of Long Beach,missed the exit and ended up on an alley on side of hotel which was scary but once inside it felt safe. Never had to go through that alley again...thank goodness. Not bad for a pre night cruise hotel that includes parking while on cruise and a shuttle to and from pier. Employees were nice :)
Best Western of Long Beach,We were only there for one night but the stay was wonderful. Nice breakfast setup as well as very helpful staff and the ability to setup shuttles to the cruising dock.
Best Western of Long Beach,complimentary shuttle to / from both long beach airport and cruise terminal in san pedro. many dinig options with 2 blocks.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Chose for cruise and stay option as we were taking cruise for Christmas. Was hopeful when I saw exterior, hopes plummeted when I checked in. Although numerous signs indicated under construction, hotel was dirty and poorly maintained. Huffy check in staff when I rejected initial room due to peeling wall paper, dated furnishings, overall appearance, only to see other room... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"Good stay and price for the stay and cruise deal, I liked that the staff knew about carnival cruise date and time and the pick up and drop off for the cruise was another great reason for us to stay with best western"
Best Western of Long Beach,It was close to my Business meetings and Convention Center
Best Western of Long Beach,Very Good hotel with clean spacious room and nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of car parking spaces. Reception staff very friendly and welcoming. Area around hotel a little sketchy but not too bad. Would stay here again if in Long Beach.
Best Western of Long Beach,"We just arrived on an international flight. Front desk was amazing,y helpful and gave us an earlier check I which we were greatful for. Rooms were clean and beds comfy.

Best Western of Long Beach,If you are going on a cruise this hotel is perfectly located and near some good places to eat the night before. We were given great directions to everything and we would gladly chose this property again.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I have stayed with this Best Western on 5 occasions. Always a good experience. I have left my car there while on cruises and taken the shuttle, Martin drives the shuttle and is always helpful. The free breakfast offer several choices for hungry travelers. The dining area is clean and so are the rooms."
Best Western of Long Beach,The rooms were like any other best western. There's nothing extraordinary about the hotel. There's a liquor around the corner and a gas station. The Pizza Hut pick up place is across the street. The parking was fine. If you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night here.
Best Western of Long Beach,I do not understand how this hotel even is open. We booked this hotel through Southwest Airlines and when we arrived there was no electricity and no information about when it would be restored. There were other guests in the parking lot with their luggage. We cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the neighborhood where the hotel is... More

Best Western of Long Beach,"Best Western of Long Beach is in a older section of town with a public train stop directly out the front of the hotel. Hotel is average nothing bad nothing great. Wish we would have looked more at the B/W at the convention center, it is within walking distance to many attractions while this one was not. This hotel was... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"There are other options---look! Group of 8 ended up choosing this hotel, before departing on a cruise.

Great location for the metro (station right outside) and access to Long beach and Hollywood/LA itself."
Best Western of Long Beach,We thought we'd spend the weekend on Catalina Island. But there were no hotel bargains and besides parking our car by the pier would have cost 20+ per day. So we discovered this hotel which provides free hotel parking and a shuttle service to and from the Queen Mary which we toured. From the hotel they also provided us a... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"My husband and I stayed here for one night before taking the Catalina Express the following morning. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The bed was not particularly comfortable. The continental breakfast was nothing special, but it got the job done. Having many food allergies, I appreciated the wide variety of breakfast options. I would stay here... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"I stayed here a few years back and although my stay was pleasant the rooms were old and worn, carpets not in good shape.I was pleasantly surprised to to see the changes since then. I stayed in a lovely suite that was so nice I thought I was at a different hotel. The front desk clerks were very nice and... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Second time staying at this hotel. Staff was friendly and accommodating to requests. Will definitely stay again. Shuttle vans are available to take you to convention center or to cruise terminal if you are catching a cruise out of Long Beach.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Nasty, disgusting carpet! My 1-year-old, 3-year-old, husband, and myself walked around the room for about 5 minutes and realized our feet were turning BLACK from the carpet. Gross!!! It was also sticky. You can tell they never clean it. I could have stayed cleaner walking here from the runway at LAX. The bathroom smelled like someone locked themselves in there... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel was very clean, staff was friendly. It is in an older part of town but there were plenty of places to eat or order in. Would stay again. Nice pool area and breakfast was plentiful. it is in close proximity to the Aquarium and the Queen Mary. We visited both."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Pros: Great house-keeping, free breakfast and parking, right outside the metro station, gas station and laundry service Cons: Breakfast area (not seating) is small that people keep bumping into each other only one washer and dryer for guests slowestttttt elevator and the condition of the stairs was questionable the hallway doors would close with a loud bang (pity the people in rooms closer to these doors) Personal con: Our room door kept getting stuck in the carpet A/C while kept at High (not auto) kept switching off and on throughout the night!"
Best Western of Long Beach,"Comfortable / Relaxed stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Convenient breakfast hours, nice item selection."
Best Western of Long Beach,"This hotel is very nice. Doesn't look like much when you first get here, but the staff is very helpful and accomodating. There is a Lpng Beach airport, and cruise port shuttle from this hotel. That was perfect because we rented a car to get around the day before the cruise. When I returned the car I was able to...

Best Western of Long Beach,The front desk lied to us when we checked in and said we had a park and cruise package and the next morning they said we didn't have the package and the front desk manager was very vulgar and rude with us saying its our fault and too bad so sad. Very unprofessional.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Stayed a night with the extended family. There were 10 of us total so we ended up with joining rooms. Weird part 1 was the second room didn't have a door that lead to the hallway. I didn't do the check in so I can comment on that. The room itself was decent. We had two queen beds, a bathroom,...

Best Western of Long Beach,Room smelled terrible and carpet dirty. I wouldn't stay here again
Best Western of Long Beach,"If you are planning on staying at BW of Long Beach before your cruise out of Port of Long Beach, I highly recommend that you stay somewhere else. The location is scary, our room looked like it had not been vacuumed in months. I was told we would get shuttled to the Port of Long Beach for our cruise and... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"although from the outside this property may look a little dated, the rooms are actually big and comfortable. The beds are comfortable, everything works fine and the breakfast offers eggs and sausage, along with yogurt, breads and waffles. There were lots of places around the property to eat and had access to most freeways."
Best Western of Long Beach,Got in early from our cruise. No rooms available at the time. Left our name and number with the front desk and they had a room ready by the time we were done with lunch. Awesome! The neighborhood surrounding the hotel might make some question their safety. But. We had none of those feelings at all. After you get over... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Stayed at this hotel as a pre-stage for the cruise. Erika and Martin were great as hosts for the stay.

The restaurants in the area are local based but we called in pizza and wings... More
Best Western of Long Beach,The hotel is being upgraded holes they will changing mattresses. I have a bad back so the mattress was to soft. Other than than everyone was very nice. I was the last one to check in for the night I front desk waited for me
Best Western of Long Beach,Staff was very friendly. No wait to check in or out. The room was clean. My only issue would be that the sink and toilet were very low. It almost looked like it had been built with children in mind.
Best Western of Long Beach,"great stay especially if you going on a cruise ship out of long beach...great airport transfers beds were soft and staff was pleasant. pool was clean, what more can I say , they has some construction, however it didn't bother us."
Best Western of Long Beach,We stayed here on June 2012. We had to book a room from this hotel because there wasn't anything else in our price and location range. Nice staff and clean rooms. Big minus from not having outdoor pool. Beach was close but dirty. Long Beach had really good restaurants and there was a nice caf place just right next to... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Everywhere I looked in our room and the hotel there were problems. The carpet was peeling up and torn in many places, there was a huge stain next to the bed that looked like it could be blood, the wallpaper was falling off (in our bathroom there was mold on the wallpaper by the sink), it smelled bad everywhere except... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,"The hotel is a little run down and in a rough part of town. However, they are remodeling so it will surely help. My kids liked the heated pool in January. Too cold for me but not them. The staff was helpful and the breakfast was good enough. No roll away beds here. They just don't do them."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Thank you to all the staff that helped our stay easy and efficient, We stayed for only one evening to get on our cruise ship the next morning. They were prompt at getting us there and prompt with picking us up. Martin our driver was very informational. We would definitely stay again. Thank you!"
Best Western of Long Beach,"Wonderful under cover parking. The staff are helpful, very pleasant, were organized and efficient. The hotel is also close to the convention center and not far from the beach. Everything worked well, TV airconditioner, lights. Bed was comfortable."
Best Western of Long Beach,"Very limited parking, High gang/criminal element. Do NOT bring children here! Staff seems uninterested in helping you solve any problems or objections you might have. Spend the extra 40 dollars or so a night to secure a hotel close by in a better area."
Best Western of Long Beach,Hotel is in a very bad area of town. Gunshots are heard regularly. Homeless and druggies walking around hotel. Police had drawn gun on a man in alley behind hotel upon our arrival and I was scared to get out of car. Elevator stopped working for a time and we had to take stairs to haul luggage. Dark dingy hotel.... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Great breakfast
Best Western of Long Beach,"We tried staying two nights and wanted to purchase the park and cruise package, but to do so we had to make two reservations.

Best Western of Long Beach,"After along day, our desk clerks were so nice and friendly that it made the day end great. We definitely will be staying there again!

Best Western of Long Beach,"We were in town for a dance event at the convention center, which was only about a mile away. The Best Western offers a very convenient free shuttle service around downtown Long Beach between 7 am and 4 30 pm. Martin was very helpful as a driver and manager at the hotel. The staff were easy going and friendly. The... More"

Helped us get tickets to Universal Studios organised a taxi etc. Didn't get to see much of Long Beach as we went to LA and universal. Hollywood was OK but the main strip is full of... More
Best Western of Long Beach,The rooms are large and it was quiet at night but some daytime remodeling noise. It is close to grocery stores and pharmacy. Elevator to below ground parking as well as floors. Nice breakfast with hot choices.
Best Western of Long Beach,"I stayed in this hotel prior to taking a cruise, so the location was great for that. The room was worn looking with a torn lampshade and stained carpet, but it was comfortable enough. I would not recommend a room by the elevators, because it was noisy in the halls, and being farther away would probably help. The breakfast was... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,Originally we'd intended to stay Sunday night and leave early Monday morning on a cruise ship until we got stuck at work all night and missed our check in. When we rolled into the hotel at EIGHT AM they were kind enough to let us sleep past the check-out time so we could rest before boarding our ship. Very kind... More
Best Western of Long Beach,We stayed here when we were heading out on a cruise out of Long Beach. It was a cheap room and since we only needed it for one night it was not a horrible choice. The breakfast was not bad and they had a shuttle to the cruise terminal. It is located right across the street from a stop for... More
Best Western of Long Beach,"Great service from bryan, Juan and martin. Very clean and staff were very hospitable. Great continental breakfast selection and nice pool. Clean and spacious with comfortable beds. Would return the next time we visit long beach."
Best Western of Long Beach,The employees are very pleasant and helpful. They are always smiling and ready to answer questions. We stayed 2 nights so that we could have a day to sightsee. On the day of the cruise we used the shuttle system from the hotel.. We left at our scheduled time and the driver was a really nice guy.
Best Western of Long Beach,"once inside, hotel was nice. would not venture out at night. Towels were very scratchy from over bleaching."
Best Western of Long Beach,The Best Western is in a very good location. They have a shuttle to and from the airport as well as the cruise and Catalina Boat Terminals. They have a park and fly package. The Metro Blue Line Rail is available (boarding is half a block away) One direction takes you to Downtown Long Beach where you can catch a... More
Best Western of Long Beach,Hotel was clean great staff but not too good of an area looked better than any other hotel in the area
Best Western of Long Beach,"Next time you want a shuttle service it would be better if you use UBER service, the shuttle you would have to walk 1/2 mile on the hotels shuttle service from drop off. Waste of time and money. Be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the hotel, the answer was not until you guys are... More"
Best Western of Long Beach,I stay at Best Westerns all over the Southern California area. This one is a great hotel for the money and location. They have done an excellent job in updating an older property and it is evident that they take great care of the hotel.
Best Western of Long Beach,"Great location for proximity to Long Beach attractions and access to the Pacific Coast Highway. Better priced rooms than any town further south. This hotel has been renovated, but an old odor remains in the room---not sure if it's dust, cigarette smoke, or mildew. Pillows were terrible. I woke with a neck ache each morning. Walls are thick between rooms, but I could hear footsteps from the floor above all night. One elevator for 4 floors isn't enough."
Best Western of Long Beach,Room was clean however the clerk Juan was very rude.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,good but bathroom should definitily have exhaust fan
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The bottom of the tub in the bathroom was old, stained and dirty and I didn't even want to shower in it!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,there was some ants inside the room at last night and the staff is not helpful
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Overall stay was comfortable,Cons- pool closing 7p on Sunday eve when it was over 100Not pleased.."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Was very convenient and everything was nearby. Kids got to go swimming, shopping and sightseeing. Adults enjoyed playing Bingo and gambling. Lots of places to eat as well. Thank-you"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The Hotel is decent, the rooms are large...however, the bathroom tub backed up and the water would not drain, same issue with the sink. The air conditioner didn't seem to keep the room cool, it was warm. When we let the front desk know, they did NOTHING to fix the issues. We would NOT stay at this hotel again, it was inexpensive but now we know why it is inexpensive."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This was the second worst hotel/motel I've ever stayed in. There was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in. Housekeeping did not want to send anyone to take out the trash or bring more towels. The towels were frayed. Our non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke. There was no coffee maker. Our receipt from hotels.com said there was room service, but there was no room service. We forgot an item, but when we called to see if they found it and could return it, we were told, Sorry, the lost and found is only open M-F, 8-5. Not one employee acted as if we were in any way valued guests. I'm glad we only stayed the one night. I will never stay there again and I will tell everyone I know about the horrible time we had there."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Nice hotel and great location downtown.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The price was to high for what the hotel offering !!!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Bad room - view to the Greyhound bus depot right outside window. Big gap underneath room door, easily could see people going back and forth on hallway."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We had a good time, but the elevators were always such a long wait."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Rooms were super comfortable, up to date and quiet. We were able to rest after 2 weeks of travel and enjoyed the small pool the next day. Wish that coffee was provided in the rooms."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"the room was nice visually, but the mattress was old we woke up with unexplained bites on our arms and legs so first thing that came to mind was bed bugs. I didn't see any but the bites continued. then I woke up with full on hives all over my stomach and chest, I never had hives before. house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so I decided to just make up the bed myself and clean. but the 3rd day I called in the morning left for the day and came back from the pool after one and still no house keeping so I had to call again. front desk called me 2 times in the middle of the night once to ask me a question that could have waited till morning and the second was a mistake both about 2 am when I was asleep because it was our last night. we check in on a Thursday and they only had 2 people doing check in up to sunday, sunday is the first time I saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in. I wont be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through. the pool was awesome but that's it."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The air conditioning unit was extremely loud and filthy. It made it very difficult to sleep. Probably will not stay again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The door to the emergency exit was kicked out and had graffiti .. The water stunk and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station .. Many transients For a traveling business woman to feel safe . The staff for check in was minimal at best .. I will not stay there again
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Not good. I couldn't sleep because the AC is too old and loud. It would go on for 1 min then stop 1 min. When it restarts it is too noisy. The room has no oxygen I had a bad headache
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Rooms need microwave and refrigerators
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,swimming pool was not very clean. too many people in the pool.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It really SUCKED the room was next to the exit door which was banging even to 4am. I asked to be moved to another room and I was refused. Question is it due to the fact we are Japanese Plus had to pay for resort FEE must be for the banging door Would you yourself want the room of the sound of the banging door. The girl to whom gave us this room should be FIRED !!!!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Our room looked like it hadn't been clean for a month. I found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there. It was very gross and disturbing. The bathrooms were not so clean as well. Maybe if the hotel room was more clean it would have been a better experience.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Pulled into the self-parking area, sign said 10 a day, then had to take the elevator down to the first floor, then go through the entire length of the dreary-looking casino pulling my luggage, finally made it to the registration desk, waited on line for about 15 minutes, was told that there would be a mandatory surcharge of 18 (which did include the 10 parking fee, breakfast not included). The room itself was fine. The 24/7 fitness room was locked when I got there, and my room key did not open it. Stayed only one night, and left in the morning."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We went to play pickleball, as the hotel is opening 12 new courts on the 5th floor near the swimming pool."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Hotel lobby was hot. Nowhere to park and check in. Casino carpet was dirty, torn and tattered... as was my room. No coffee maker, sink would not drain, tub was super slippery and shower curtain rod was broken. There were no hooks or towel rods inthe bathroom. Bed was hard and the window was dirty with dead bugs in window sill. No brochure on hotel amenities, dining options or room service. McDonald's in the food court served me an egg mcmuffin with runny egg whites. Had to pay to park, then had to give the guard at the parking exit all my info just to leave because I didn't have a room key. I had just checked out!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Was great will go back soon
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Staff was distracted or uncoordinated. Frustrating until we learned the right people who had the time and information to help us. Those people where amazing! 1 person for our 3 days that was helpful at each of these locations. Front desk day 3, rewards card day 3, housekeeping day 3, bartender day 3. Got our coupon book on day 3 before the flight and I finally played some tables. These customer service issues aren't a problem for us as we now know how to deal with it but I worry for your over all customer base. Attention and patience with each person, and if you don't know help them find out how to find the I formation. That's all. We will be back:)"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The Plaza Hotel was fairly nice. You can tell the hotel is a bit older and they have done renovations on it. Some items, like the elevator and furniture in the rooms show clear signs of wear but not terribly so. The pool is great and so is the casino in the lobby. Free breakfast is not included, but there are a lot of restaurants in the hotel."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,As we arrived at our room I noticed the bad smell of it. The first night I also noticed the bed sheets had some hair (disgusting) I tried to call front desk but never got an answer. The room was cheap. I guess you really get what you pay for.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Plaza Hotel might not be the best luxurious hotel but our 3 days stay was comfortable. The location is good and convenient to rides and places of interest.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I don't know who they thought we were but they upgraded us to a gigantic suite for the same price! Very cool.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This was our 4th of July get away. Always like Fremont Street for people watching and all the shows going on! A great vibe with folks from all over, friendly and vibrant. The pool was redone and very nice. Food and drinks were everywhere and its never a long walk to go someplace different. Look for 'The Park' on Fremont Street - an oasis in the city!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The husband and I decided to come here as our last summer getaway for this year. Fun!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We booked last minute for a three-night stay in Vegas and got a great deal. When we checked in the staff was severely overloaded, there were two people at the front desk and probably 100 people checking in. They quickly remedied the situation and we got through the line fast and got an upgrade! The room was very clean, large and the bed was so comfortable! Great deal for the price!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Staff was very good. Check in Lines were fast. For the price and the location on Freemont street the room was excellent. Very clean and comfortable at a fair price.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Check in was ridiculous. Took us about 45 minutes waiting in line.. Door keys didn't work, service was really bad, AC unit in our room sounded like a diesel truck"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I feel dirty
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Went for Punk Rock Bowling. Right in front of the Fremont Experience. Pretty cool. Parking is free once you check in and they'll reimburse the money you used to enter the first time. Bathroom had no window which was weird but got used to it. The best part was live bands playing at the pool. Freakin Angelic upstarts played for free. Dope
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The hotel room was nice and clean including the bathroom.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,great bang for the buck.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Parking lot terrible and dirty. Pool closed due to high winds, no notice to guests, and no notice if other hotels pools availability."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I can't be too hard on this hotel because I had an idea of what I was getting into. It looks like it's stuck in the 70's. You can see where some remodeling has been done and is continuing to be done - but keeping up appearances doesn't seem to be urgent. The pool is okay (good for wading) but will deteriorate over time. It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Even though it's right there across the street from the Fremont Experience with all that noise and energy, the room was quiet and nice.(Be aware! During special times like around New Year's, where bands are playing all the time, it might be loud....that was my experience at the D, the Grand, and another hotel. I cannot guarantee it won't be loud here too I just don't know.) Anyway, no complaints. at all."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We had a wonderful stay at the Plaza Hotel. The employees there were very helpful in every manner. The room was very clean and close to everything.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,at best an okay hotel. lobby was really smelly. the way to get to parking was difficult.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We can hear noises off and on created by the wind,We're on the 15th floor. Have to place towel to seal the door to prevent the wind escaping inside and creates annoyinunog loud noise. It works! For the price it's affordable, reasonable and saved lots of money. Free valet parking, and the attendants are helpful and courteous."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was good staying close to everything only thing they need more employee when u check in and out is a long wait
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I was a bit up set that housekeeping never came to clean the room and when a called them to send someone up to my room to be clean they never came after an hour waiting j called back and told them just don't come because i was already tired this was at 6pm
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Very bad
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Great value for dollar and right next to freemont experience . But the pool closes by 9 and the beds were horrible, hard and smashed at the same time."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Daryl at the front desk was great. one employee said we couldn't check in early, but he took great care of us and gog us a 10 am check in."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Check in took over an hour because they were severely understaffed. There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional. Plenty of gambling and place to eat nearby. It is located 25 minutes from the airport."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Just stayed for a date night. Right at the end of the Freemont Street Experience. Hotel is in ok shape for its age, but they charge you 10 to park even if you are a guest. Most other hotels in the area will validate/comp parking for hotel guest."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I was,in room 2111 right bybthe ice machines and elevators. Every couple of of minutes you would hear this God awful noise through the wall right on the same wall as the headboard. It kept me up all night. What a disaster"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,So much I will be here again
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Didnt like our stay at all. Took forever to get a room. Then took forever for the elevators because only 2 were working. Got in the room it's very outdated. The fridge is old and dented. The toilet had urine on the seat. The bed said queen size but seemed like full.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The bathroom had hair on the floor when we got there and throughout our stay. The service was poor long lines with never a second associate to help check in or out, though people were behind the counter. Their pool was being renovated and a nearby hotel was allowing guests to swim there, but that was never told to us. We heard it told to someone else while we were waiting to check out. You really get what you pay for with this one."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It was actually a very good stay, the pool was really nice and I loved how it was right at the end of Fredmont street, and the casino here was actually really nice..."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Stayed one night and quite happy with hotel experience.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Friendly staff very helpful
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"2-adults, 2-teens, room was spacious and comfortable. Would have been nice to have small refrig. and microwave paid extra for small refrig. (brought up right away). Towels and wash cloths were limited, but soon as I called for extra, housekeeping came up quickly and delivered. The hotel was not posh, and a bit old, but the service was great, the room was clean and smoke free. The Greyhound bus station is literally next door and appeared derelict free. Parking became limited on Saturday night. All-in-all, I'd go back."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Parking is a joke. Valet is at the other end of the casino from registration. We were handed ear plugs at check-in, due to all night noise from Freemont Street. Didn't use them, but it was unusual."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Wait times to check in were in excess of 40 minute on a Monday night around 10pm. Elevator took well over 10minutes to come to ground level and even longer to go to level 4. Credit card was hacked at front desk on the swipe because they do not use the newer chip technology. Received a call from chase and asked if i made several purchases the next morning and that is how i discovered the breech. Please start using the chip, such a stronger platform and helps prevent things like this. I'm not upset with the hotel for the hack, however measures should be taken to protect your customers."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This was the first time I have stayed on Fremont Street. The hotel itself was fine, but Fremont is filthy. I was wearing flip flops and ended up throwing them away because they were so dirty. If you are looking for a weekend of partying on a budget then this is the place to go."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Excellent!!! I stayed here the first night of a three day stay in Vegas. I did to get the Fremont experience. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and the pool party was fun. The cocktail waitress was particularly fun and accommodating. The room was comfortable with a nice dcor. I will definitely stay here again. A downtown day is a new must for my Vegas vacation!!! The Plaza will be my host."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Horrible. Checked out 4 hours after check in and booked a different hotel. Waited for Hotel to get problem fixed but got the run around.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Horrible horrible horrible staff. Valet parking was terrible temperature of room was terrible
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,it was ok nice room for the price but what i really didnt like was the service so unorganized i parked at the hotel of course no one told me as i checked in i would need a recipt for the parking so in the end when leaving tried to charge me 15 per car so i had to explain i was a guesst and it was just a hassle never gone throught that when staying any where but other then service rooms where nice a bit old need to be remodoled but still nice for the price just because of the service im giving it a 3
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Room had a bad odor and many of the items in the room (lamps, electrical outlets etc) were either broken or in poor condition. No wash cloths provided. Property felt run down and neglected."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Free internet kept going out every 5 minutes. Hotel not kept clean. Elevators dirty. Parking garage elevator not air conditioned. I hate the Fremont Street area but the price was right.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I reserved a non-smoking room but received a smoking room. My reservation dates or scheduled wrong by the hotel and we're one day short. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are uncomfortable. Television service was not good. There were very few channels.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,had a good time. clean and friendly
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We, a family, had to walk through the casino from parking to room, our kids had to see the smoking old people in the casino. There was no other path from the parking to the lobby but still we were approached 3 times by security to make our kids not look at the machines. Very rude! Make a casino clear path to the lobby and we will be glad to avoid looking at the machines and breathing the stinky smell of cigarettes! The street across the hotel made a very loud noise all night even from the 22 floor."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Called at night for noisy above my room. They promised to call back and nobody did it. So we couldn't sleep well.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Absolutely the worst experience ever the elevator was going at the speed of a glacier soooo slow 25 min not joking to wait unltimatly took the stairs 115 weather was not accommodated to my room specification no fridge ice machine didn't work half the time only thing I can say it's clean in the room but your not promised what you asked for .
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It was a great location, but the room view was the worse ever,window dirty and the toilet everytime you flush it it drops water up, and the shower was plug I needed to call for that, only I mirrow in bathroom,for my 1st. time there I think we deserve a better room, sorry."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Was ok
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Great value
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Nice, recently updated, great service, convenient location, my room looked directly into the Fremont Street Experience. The beds were a little hard, but definitely doable."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Warning, do not stay at this hotel, dirty, unsafe, very bad, hotel staff was bad...."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,it was great time
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Came to Vegas for my daughter's wedding. Hadn't been here for 20yrs. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. The only thing was my mattress was lumpy on one side. But I would definitely stay here again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We booked a King room and when we arrived they said they only had Queen rooms and didn't apologize or try to accommodate, they just assigned us the room. The hotel and rooms had a bad smell and everything was stained: drapes, bedding, and furniture."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,room itself was very comfortable-bathrooms are super small and the plumbing in the tub kept backing up.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The room was dated, old furniture and a bit dirty. Our cooler started leaking on to the carpet. Carpet got soggy. Later on, our cooler went out so it was pretty warm in our room. Sunday, the next morning. No hot water. We went to the front desk and let them know. They said they working on the water so a lot of guests didn't have hot water, they said about another hour hot water should be back on. The leaking cooler, they didn't get back to us because, they were going to send someone up to take a look at it, but my husband and son were still sleeping. This is like 8am. So they said let us know when. We left to meet our Realtor. So we didn't let them know and by the time we got back. We were too tired from everything. But at least they could've called our room and asked if we still needed the cooler checked. The had our numbers also. I mean would think that they would note it down on the the computer. No fridge in the room, if you want one, it's 20 a day. No microwave. No view of Las Vegas. The only is concrete walls. If you want a view of Las Vegas. 20 extra. We had to pay 10 to park in the garage, the first time. Later I asked the front desk if we had to pay but, they reimburse us. Later I asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage. He said No, just use our room card to go in and out."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Very bad atitude service
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Really disappointed. Reserved a king size bed. Got there 1 hour after check in, they was sold out of King size beds, they gave me 2 queen size beds. Also room service knocked on door at 8:00 am Saturday morning. One knock then 1 sec later door opened that is was house keeping. Not cool at all."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Front desk is very slow bad customer service
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,waiting to checking ''0ne clerk'' about 40 people waiting .Give me a room key can't open the door .comeback waiting in line for the other 20 minute. reprogram the key go back my room still can 't open the door .Go back to the front deck .They agree to make me anew key . it take 45 minute s just get inside the room .The tower are dirty ask housekeeper to change a new one.It is not too much better. Next room to me must have 10 peoples inside .Call the front desk to complain .No body care .It is bad . Don't think recommend anybody stay here .
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Overall good stay. Rooms in the north tower are a little beat up. Weird smell different than the other casinos but bearable. Right off freemont street which was great. The pool was nice as well rooftop.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Overall it was good however, the cable tv service was outdated and difficult to use. Additionally, the running water randomly changed from hot to cold on its own and the bathtub drained extremely slow."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We enjoyed our stay and found the Plaza hotel very accommodating. We had a problem with the plumbing that was fixed promptly. Our out unsolved issue is that the TV cable system was very slow, it took about 6 to 7 seconds to move from channel to channel."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We were there for business, the first night the Freemont blvd. Was rockin till kinda late, if your trying to get some sleep... But it is Vegas, and we were in the heart of things..."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"LONG, LONG wait in line to both check in and check out"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,bag was stolen from car in parking garage
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I got an upgraded room with a view this past weekend--and it was a great view of Fremont St... unfortunately that room didn't have a working AC. Arriving back at my room at the end of a festive night, I wasn't sure why it wasn't as cool as I thought my room could or should be--it wasn't until I couldn't sleep that I knew for sure there was a problem. When I went to the front desk first thing in the morning, I was told, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do. Well--the 3rd party didn't assign me that room with the faulty AC unit (one that looked like it had not been cleaned or maintained in years). The Plaza did that. After getting to my new room, and comparing the AC units--it was like I was given the faulty room specifically because I booked through a 3rd party, that way if I complained all they had to say was, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do. Yeah. I won't be staying there again."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Stayed there before..and loved it
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Unfortunately there was no hot water when we woke up the day we were checking out. Could not shower or wash my hair. Front desk was apologetic and refunded my resort fee, but that didn't make up for having to leave without showering. Not goo."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I know Vegas is not for kids but we did a quick fam trip to get out of town and attend a concert, but the kids couldn't even enjoy the pool sat because it was only open for 21 and over due to a concert, I wish I would've known that before booking. The hotel was so packed, it was unorganized. Room was not that clean and tub would get plugged every time you showered. Not the greatest trip."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"There is only one person working at this hotel, that saved this review from being horrible. Cedric was made me feel welcomed here and tried to help me when no one else would. Others at the front desk were plain rude, and generally I'm easy to please with just a slight bit of customer service. Cedric went above and beyond, because of him I didn't cancel my reservation and stay elsewhere."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Everything was great
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"very nice staff, beautiful pool area"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,our stay was great.no complaints
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The Big Blues Bender was awsome. .. And it was comfortable and enjoyable. ...
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Overall not a bad place. After reading a prior review from a Lady I was a little leary of staying here because of deposit drama. But they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and it was immediately credited upon check-out. They did put us on the back side of the hotel. Did hear a couple of trains during the night, ac was a little loud but really not a bad place. Was clean comfortable. Great location, walk out the lobby, cross the street and you are on Fremont Street."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Amazing
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,This hotel was horrible do not stay here...find a better hotel for the money you will spend
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Nothing listed in the Hotels.com description was offered. No room service, no dry cleaning / laundry service."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I BOOKED ON HOTELS.COM TO FIND A CHEAP ROOM JUST TO SLEEP FROM 6AM TO 1PM....THEY GOT ME IN A ROOM THAT ENDED UP COSTING 70 BUCKS WITH HIDDEN FEES AND A RIDICULOUS 11AM CHECKOUT WITH A THREAT TO CHARGE 250 IF EVEN A FEW MINUTES LATE CHECKING OUT.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Perfect location at the entrance to Freemont Street. Room is very comfortable but with the resort fee, is a bit over priced"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was Great...hotel so far one of the best.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This place was economical but they have really poor customer service during the check out. For those wanting an express check out - you cant easily get a receipt for business services because the hotel staff takes a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process. They need two lines. People need receipts, and cant wait 30 minutes to check out. Consider putting receipt under doors the night before check out."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The Plaza was a great value for the money. The rooms were a little worn but the were quiet and comfortable. It was great for everything going on downtown and plenty of food choices in the hotel or nearby
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Was enjoyable...only thing was the switch for the lamp didn't work so I had to reach under dresser to unplug it...shower curtain was a little dirty ..1 ewww! Emoji for that!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I was not happy with the stay. The room looked bad. The TV didn't work and bed sheets had stains. AC didn't work properly. I will never go back and stay there.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,great for a one night stay
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It was great but the bathroom was so small, the casino was too smokey"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The room was clean but a little old.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The room was okay for the price. I would not stay there again. The hotel is being renovated and I was in a newly renovated room. If you don't mind the basics and care more about the price then this might work for you. The room itself was half renovated--one of the chairs was old and gross but the room is pretty basic. It's like a fancy Motel 6. My friend was on a budget otherwise I definitely would not have stayed here. The pool was closed--was only open to some people but the guy who worked there wouldn't even let me look through the glass door at the pool. He was rude. I asked if I could look through the glass door to check out their new pool and he said no the pool was closed--it was five minutes to 7 and they close at 7. Yikes. The fire alarm went off when we were there. One of the staff told us we could ignore it. My friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to find out. No one would talk to us and we had to wait to get someone's attention. It took a long time before we found out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear. BTW the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter. They seem sad to work there.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Nice room, friendly staff, free parking"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Room was nice location, but hotel was in poor shape, there were crumbs all over the night stand, and the furniture was falling apart. Also the bathroom wasn't the cleanest."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Had fun playing Let It Ride. I had a great dealer at the Plaza and walked away with money. And I love the bar back by the Valet Parking. Good service and good poker machines.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Put on your walking shoes because this place does NOT have parking close to the hotel. The area of town it is in is also not the most desirable. Guess I should have known that for the price. Rooms had been redecorated but weren't modern by any stretch of the imagination. I'd pass on the opportunity to stay here again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,EVERYTHING WAS OK EXCEPT FOR THAT UPON CHECKING IN I WAS CHARGED MORE THAN I WAS QUOTED AND THE FRONT DESK DID NOT TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY WERE CHARGING MY CARD UNTIL AFTER THEY PROCESSED 2 TRANSACTIONS... IT WAS MORE THAN I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED TO PAY AT CHECK IN... GINA
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Great!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,They charge me extra money just for stay 15 more minutes
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Lost water all morning in the South Tower -16th floor. Finally fixed. Management gave us 20 credit to use at their restaurant. 16th floor ice machine did not work for the entire week we were there. Slow elevators. Comfortable bed. Nice view from room. No coffee pot or refrigerator.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Good hotel to stay in for affordable price
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Great location staff was helpful and friendly great value
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"IT WAS REALLY NICE GREAT GET AWAY,"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I staid 3 nights for family vacation
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was a place to stay. nothing to exciting.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Clean and A nice new pool!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,we enjoyed this hotel so much. right at the end of Fremont Street. room was comfortable and clean. we always stay here!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was amazing. I will definitely be checking back in !
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I loved it here, went with my boyfriends family. I loved the size of the room as well, the only things i didn't like was the bad smell at the bottom of the elevator. It smelled like BO. Another thing is when checking out to get an elevator takes like 30 mins to an hour and the stairs isn't an option when you're on the 12th floor. Everything else was good. I didn't like that our bed sheets had some dirty spots on them."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Liked the convenience of Fremont Street. Did not like the access to the parking garage, when staying in the North Tower. Liked the convenience of all the restaurants. Didn't like that the pool was only open until 7pm. The hotel staff was friendly. Didn't like having to pay the resort fees in addition to the room price. It should be included in the negotiated rate. The beds were very comfortable. The A/C worked awesome, since it was so hot.....108 in the day/ 98 in the night. Maintenance came quickly for a clogged toilet. Overall it was great, we had fun not worrying about the small stuff."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This was a terrible experience since our ac would not cool the room, we got locked out of our room on the 21st floor with 2 seven year old twins, and our room was not clean. The housekeepers (i guess you call them) did not clean, fix beds, leave towels, soap or toilet paper. I am unhappy and feel as though i should be compensated for this horrible experience."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I like
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Check in was over an hour. Had to call for our own bellman when we arrived at the hotel. There was no coffee or wash cloths in the room. Every time we called the front desk no one answered. On our last day there was no hot water in bathroom and TV had no signal during our stay over the weekend.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,There were drug dealers out side of this hotel and roaches in our room I would not recommend this hotel my wife had to use one of the cleaning lady's vacuums because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,won't be booking a stay at the plaza ever again!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The front desk check in is very slow.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"we always enjoy our stay at the Plaza ! Friendly service, love the new pool area, great food."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We were very pleasantly surprised. The rooms were up to date and lovely.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,There are no amenities at this hotel. No room service. Valet is a city block from registration. Just blah. Fremont street can be heard loud and clear in you room (16th floor) loud and clear until about 1:30am. The other side of the hotel you have trains. Very noisy no matter where you are located.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,My family and I were very much satisfied with our stay at the plaza hotel. Our rooms were clean and we had easy access to Fremont st.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I had stayed at this Hotel many times. It's very comfortable. the staff is always very professional and nice. Also the resort fee is cheaper then most other resorts.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Great location, newly updated, very pleased."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Took forever to get our fridge
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Overall good experience. Great location, but sound proofing for partying going on outside until 1 AM not accounted for. Good luck getting to sleep before then, even Mon-Thurs"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Checked in had to call for a remote for the tv. Hotels.com says they have dry cleaning / laundry service room service-- trust me....they don't. I wouldn't stay here again. The only good thing is it was right there at the Fremont Street Experience, which is what my friend wanted to see."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Stayed here for the pickleball. Nice new permanent courts, roof top. Friendly staff at the pool and nice security folks. Fun crazy location."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Only negative we had, long wait at check in...."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,2 people checking in a long line Was bad and the sink in the room had a bad odor coming from the plumbing.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"If you are unlucky enough to have one of the suite rooms in the tower closest to the Fremont Experience, you will get noisy neighbors who are there to celebrate all night long and sleep during the day. If your neighbors are quiet, you'll get noise from the Fremont Experience Bands playing until the early morning, or the grinding of freight trains on the tracks all night long! If you do stay here, request a room in the other tower, the one that is further away from the Check-In desk and the Fremont Experience. You might actually be able to sleep!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Really enjoyed our stay.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Had an overall good time
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Good for the price. It's Vegasif you're into it who cares where you stay
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Room was large but run down, hole in bathroom door, shower did not work very well and room smelled"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was comfortable The room was very clean Housekeeper twice a day
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The hotel is filled with cigarette smoke and smokers throughout the lobby and right outside the hotel. It even seemed to have drifted up to our room. I have asthma, so it was not a good situation for me."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Over all it was nice
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"When searching for hotels in Vegas, there are LOADS of options. I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each. Horrible view, onto a roof with some AC unit type things. windows did not open, however there were handles and some cracked caulk on it."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Older hotel but still really enjoyable. Only issue was the door adjoining two rooms DIDN'T have a lock of any type! -Freaky-
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The fan in the bathroom didn't work and neither did the TV. We told them about it and nothing was done to fix it. The swimming pool had such loud music we couldn't stand being out there. Also it was too crowded to get into the pool.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Check in was terrible. Very understaffed it took me almost 50 mins standing in line just to check in. Group in front of me was able to leave their stuff in line and go to the bar to grab a drink before they checked in.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Only stood for one night, but enjoyed my stay. Pool is nice but small. Good service poolside. If you enjoy hanging at the pool, request to stay in the South Tower. Its closest to the pool and valet parking."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I really enjoyed my stay here,the staff was all amazing"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Fire alarm went off and nothing was said over pa was a false alarm asked a cleaning personal. Had a nice view of Fremont street.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Had a great time. Check in was slow, check out was HORRIBLE as always. Only one elevator for 18 floors. My fiancee and I had to walk down 15 flights with all our belongings. I am considering paying a little extra somewhere else for a bit better service."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Good but we'll try another hotel next time
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Room ok, the lobby and outside area were bad. No doorman, next to the Greyhound Bus Station. Panhandlers, no door man, lobby was ugly, had to walk through smelly casino to get to South Tower. Would never stay there again, especially for the price."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I've stayed at the plaza before with little to no issues. Some of the rooms do get very loud when they are facing Fremont street but they will be happy to move you. This visit I found a cockroach in my room which is disgusting! Other than that, it was good, fast trip."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Horrible. Do not stay in this hotel! First they didnt bother accommodating us with 1 bed (couple) and instead gave us 2 smaller beds. (We were there during the week and there were many available rooms). The front desk was rude ( I assume they get nasty from dealing with people but all we did was ask a simple question and they were rude about it). The bathtub was clogged, we asked to unclog it and they left a mess without cleaning it up. Dirt all over the tub, and it gets worse. The bathtub still remained clogged after their snaking attempt. The lights in the room are bad, they only had 2 lamps and no ceiling light so room remained with little light. THEY CHARGE A HIDDEN FEE! We stayed for 3 nights and we got charged 82 in extra fees without warning. We have stayed in many hotels before and they usually warn us when there are parking fees or any fees. This hotel did not mention any extra fees. The elevator was disgusting, someone urinated all over the inside of elevator."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Overall a cute vintage hotel in a great location. Hotel itself thought feels tired and room was somewhat dated with old blinds, dingy shower, date lamps and the toilet seat was 100 broken off. Called first day to get it fixed - next day, never done. Stayed 4 nights. A so so value for the money. Great view from the 21st floor. Casino was also tired. Bed was comfy. Overall I would probably not stay here again. Not that bad, but not great either."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Photos on the Hotel website looked nice, different story when your there, Casino needed updating, Parking Garage was dirty, would be a nice Hotel when its renavated."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We got there, didn't look like the photos, smelled terrible, beds wee gross and covered in stains. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,very great
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I was moved to this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is overpriced. The location to the old strip is the only plus, the room was horrible, the hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe. Anyone could walk in and around, the room felt dirty and overall I would not recommend this hotel other than in an emergency or budget."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I enjoyed staying at the plaza hotel. The price was great and everyone at the hotel was super friendly.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Great room, nothing too fancy but very clean. Hotel was quality and great location."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Very disappointing. When I checked in, I was informed of a 18.50 daily Resort Fee. Although this included free parking, I was also charged 20/night because I had an oversized vehicle (Van that would not fit into their garage). With Tax, I was charged an additional 81.00 for my 2 day stay. What a rip off."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"There were some issues with the room. No TV guide, no phone directory to the hotel. Air conditioner was loud and not working properly. Could not get cold water, we had to let the water run for a few minutes. When I talked to the front desk. They did not offer a different room. They sent up maintenance to the room and they could not fix the problem."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Nice hotel enjoyed our stay...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The room was ok, and the location was good. I left four shirts hanging in the room when I left. I made several calls and spoke to house keeping, security and lost and found. Nobody could find my items or really cared that they were missing. I've stayed at many hotels and on occasion, left something behind. I've never had a hotel not find, and return my items. This hotel seemed fine with someone stealing 300 worth of clothes. It seems like it should be simple to get items back, as long as they are turned in my house keeping and tagged with a room number."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Room was nothing special. No fridge, no microwave, no coffee maker. Very small bathroom and tub looked stained and dirty. Hotel floor was gross. My shoes were black on the bottom after walking to the elevator and into my room. Beds were comfy which was good. Room was very close to pool so there was a lot of music noise. Second day they had a grand opening of the pool with very loud band and fireworks which kept me from getting much sleep."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Other than the friendly check in clerk, almost every other employee is rude, and if you ask them something, it's like you're bothering them, how could they be this way with the people that make your paycheck When I called housekeeping to request a toothbrush, she laughed and said they don't supply those to the guests. I would expect at least the toothbrush - with the resort fee they shouldn't have a problem stocking this."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,About 7am in the morning I purchased a coffee and was drinking it in the lobby when a security person came up and said if I went to sleep I was going to jail. I was amazed!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We only stayed 1 night, but enjoyed the room. The rooms were roomy and nice. Clean, and close to everything downtown. Also, had McDonalds and other food places in the hotel. The bathroom was a little bit dark, but otherwise we enjoyed it and would stay there again"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Needs a remodel
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We stayed here and honestly were surprised the room was so nice for the cost. You're also right at the foot of Fremont which is fun.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I stayed a week. Positives: The location was good, it was easy for me to get a cab whenever I needed one, the room was a good size, when the maid noticed that the bath tub was draining slow, they called for maintenance and they came up right away. Negatives: the beds were a little uncomfortable, the bathroom was too small, the wait for the elevator was long (expected when there is a lot of people)."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Casino was good and look in good condition. Elevator and walls were ok. The room was nice and big very clean BUT the shower/toilet were clog and water will take forever to come down, we the front desk twice to have somebody coome up and fixed or get a another room but booth times we were xfer to a vm. Overall will stay there again: yes , if the price Still right."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The hallways smelled real strongly like like sewer, the common areas were hot and not air conditioned."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,we like to stay on Fremont St once in awhile and when we do its at the Plaza Hotel
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Great price clean rooms.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Very nice place with great location.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Bathroom water was very hot, and it took too long to get the cool water to be available."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Terrible experience. Booked a non-smoking room, but we were given a smoking room. Rude front desk staff. Not customer friendly. We had to compromise because we had no where to go late in the night."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Hotel shows its age. Very dirty and not well maintained. Got what I paid for. Right on Freemont street. So that was good. All the employees were very nice. Free parking.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We've stayed at the Plaza our last 4 trips, and this was by far the worst experience. The front desk was very robotic like unwelcoming, and rude and when asking for a manager they were no better very uncaring.The website still lists they're poker room unlike any other which we've come to enjoy and is the main reason we frequent the plaza and they no longer have a poker room much less live poker games."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Room was average. The room and hotel smelled of cigarette smoke. The toilet base needed to be fixed. The towel rack was broken. Our room looked over Fremont Street which was fine except the music blared until 2:00 am. The hotel and rooms could use some updating
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I love the Plaza.. its my fav place to stay in Downtown Vegas. All the staff are so nice and it's also quiet if you're a sleeper.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I was a little nervous staying somewhere that I had never stayed before. My boyfriend and I got to our room to our room and we're impressed right away. The second night we were there though, I wasn't by the window and stepped back only to realize there had been a large sewing needle in the carpet somewhere and it ended up going right through my toe. Housekeeping and the headband of security were great about the whole thing going and accommodated me burn it was still a bummer. Other than that, the Plaza hotel and our stay was great!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Front desk was VERY UNDERSTAFFED. Waited over an hour just to check in. Wanted to go back to the front desk to ask for a local recommendation but decided that it wouldn't be worth the wait (more long lines) so we just went walking and asked people on the street.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Nice stay for a one nighter. Flew in late.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Bathroom area was very tight/small
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It was an ok stay. The shower couldn't drain the water, so by the time 2 person was done in the shower, he was standing in about 6 of water."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Our stay was ideal at The Plaza! Close to Fremont Street. Easy Access to Valet. Great folks at the hotel are always very helpful. South Tower is easily accessible.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and condition of the hotel. Would definitely stay again
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I reserved a room with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival. Check in was a huge mess lines were so ridiculous. My friend and I both each got rooms in at least 3 months and advance and we each got a room with one king bed, rather than two rooms each with two double beds like we asked for. They did not tell us that they gave us different rooms at check in, so we found out once we got to our rooms. I called room service and front desk and all that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't give either of double beds hung up on me. Had to call again to ask for a roll in bed, since I didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me. They only had one and so my friend didn't get one but luckily i did for my room. And the lady on the phone in room service was really rude and short with me. Elevator situation was a disaster, especially after the festival. I think only a couple of them worked and stair access was not really existent unless for emergency exiting. They also refused late checkout saying they were booked the next day even though they messed up my reservation. The new pool was pretty nice and clean and well put together. Though most of the pool is in shade by noon from its own hotel building of the plaza. Cleanliness and location were fine. I'll probably consider a different hotel next time. I've had a way better experience at Golden Nugget in the past, so I'll probably choose to go there instead if I want to stay DT."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was not very good the room did not reflect the pictures you saw of rooms on the website. There was nothing myself or my wife liked about the room what so ever
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"For sure the rooms don't look like as advertised. Bed uncomfortable and the middle of the bed big dent. Service was not at all great, customer service not there at all."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Room was disgusting.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The hotel is in a good downtown location. The area is always lively and has plenty of places to eat. However, the elevators are pretty old, and may take up to five minutes to provide service. Also, the rooms aren't very sound proof, so the concerts going on outside make for difficult sleep."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The pool area was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm! Room door wold not close right, bed was super uncomfortable, check in took for ever too! This hotel was not good at all! Zero recommendations!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The Plaza has a great location at the end of Fremont Street. The room was clean, updated, and simple. No luxury, and definitely your standard hotel room. The pool area is a decent size, but not fancy like those pool areas at hotels on the strip. There are 15 tennis courts next to it - still not sure why."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We have stayed at the Plaza several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible. It rattled so much it would wake me up. My friends had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room. We did use the pool which was very nice. Can't say I will stay there again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Not what I expected. Glad we stayed here. Great experience. Very nice hotel.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Enjoyed it
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Quiet, very comfortable beds, great location."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We needed a place to stay for the night while passing through Las Vegas. We wanted a hotel that was close to I-15 and inexpensive but clean. The Plaza Hotel was inexpensive and relatively clean and quiet but a little musty. It was nice that it was located very close to Freemont Street so we had an opportunity to experience Freemont Street without much effort. The front desk staff were nice and attentive. If we were passing through Las Vegas again and needed a place to crash for the night I would stay at this hotel again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Good hotel especially for the price. Great location, just at the end of Freemont St. They do need more pillows for the beds."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Room was average...the only complaint was the check-in process. It took over 45mins to check-in..with no early check-in available.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Everything was great.service.and.questions and requirements were even.covered
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Stay was great .. Only down fall was we requested non smoking .. We got stuck in a smoking room .. Was not happy about that
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Me and my friends took a quick mini vacation. The plaza was a great stay. We enjoyed our room, nice clean and spacious. Although there was no fridge , microwave or coffee maker and we did have a standard 2 queen bed room. Also the beds were very comfortable."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Short stay. Nice place a nice rate....
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Air conditioner made a horrible loud noise every time the fan started up. It would wake the dead.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I loved it. My view was the front of Fremont St. Experience. Everybody there was nice housekeeping kept up with you and room. Extra water and towels as needed.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was money well spent.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"the view was great, the room was nice, the bathroom was small and had no door, the tv would not work, and the booking said they had a free breakfeast and there was no breakfeast. The lady that checked us in was a little rude and did not explain how we get to our room. Acting like she just did not want to help us. THe lady that checked us out was so nice and thats when we finally recieved our reciept."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Check in is too long - they never have more than one attendant to help speedy that up. In fact, while I was checking in - one of the two attendants took a lunch even though there was a line of 5 people deep waiting to check in."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Simple place to stay after partying on Fremont. Run down, but clean. Disappointed with no mini fridge to keep our beverages cold and left over food from spoiling. Remote for TV not working. In room phone not working, could not access front desk for help. Ice machine working only on one floor, which was two floors below my room. Confusing layout--had to walk around the lobby and casino in bathing suit because of pool location. Pool bar open only for a few hours...pool good for relaxing, very clean and calm, not a party pool."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Quiet and clean room. The hotel has an odd fragrance in the air in the hotel.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The hotel room was decent, cleanliness could have been better, there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and running down a door. The chair in the room had a stain on it, as if someone sat on it with their dirty bare bottom. Also most of the towels had stains on them. Another thing, I wish their entire restroom was private. The sink area is separated from the toilet and shower, with no privacy. And the lighting there is very dim. Makes it hard to get ready, makeup wise."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was very comfortable with a great price/location.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"We stayed at the Plaza because it was right in downtown and near the wedding venue. It was a nice, but aging, hotel. It isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful. The casino is old and limited but we had fun anyway."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Well, we arrived at the hotel around 10pm, after a long drive and had to wait in line for about 30 min to check in. Some how they only had one person to check every one. For the price we paid, I was expecting a better experience... The only reason I booked that room was because it had a tub/shower however, the tub was dirty, I could not even used it( We had no tv remote control in the room and the hallway stank badly!! The casino was nice, but no one came up to offer us a drink. The restaurant was ok, the food was marginal. The best part was walking around the neighborhood, it is a great location!! We walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was still going strong... Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk! They never asked how our stay was, and when I mentioned we had no tv remote in the room the guy said oh well, maybe the last guest just took it I don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens, but come on... One more think, the parking lot is a bit far and if you are planning to bring a lot of things from your car it sUcks!!! I don't think I will ever satay there again!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Horrible! Dirty halls - piles of trash dirty linens laid in hall all night long. (see pics). Very strict checkout policy - told me if I stayed 5 minutes past 11am I would be billed another 22.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I had booked 2 separate rooms, 1 for me and my wife and 1 for my friends. Upon arrival they notified me that they could not give me 2 rooms but instead a Suite. The suite was wonderful and the rest of my stay was that much more enjoyable"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The Plaza is standard for a big hotel casinos in Vegas. Our biggest complaint was that there was no coffee maker, fridge, or micro in the room. The TV channels were very limited and the cable box did not function very well. On the plus side the Fremont street experience was directly across the street. On the whole the Plaza is fine especially if you like gambling."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was more than expected
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Just a one night before departing to Utah for National Parks
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"My Fiance and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in Downtown Vegas and we weren't expecting much from this older hotel. When we arrived there on Friday afternoon they only had ONE bellman and ONE Valet attendant. It was busy with everyone coming in for the weekend and they were clearly overwhelmed. Once the bellman arrived to take our luggage (after a good 25 minutes), we waited in the Check-in line for 30 MINUTES! They only had TWO people working in the counter and the ONE manager that they had was dealing with another guests who was very irritated by the fact that her air conditioner was not working. Upon finally making it to the counter the lady who is helping us coughs on our credit cards and says that she thinks she's getting sick because she has the chills. WHAT THE HECK!! Thanks for your contaminating our stuff you virus on legs! Once we finally got to our room in the 17th floor we immediately washed our hands and face so we wouldn't sick only to find that the bathroom hadn't been restocked with towels! The ice bucket had a wet paper towel already in it..yuck! The poor bellman who was by himself took another 30 minutes to bring us our things. If it wasn't for the fact that housekeeping came fast with extra towels and that UBER was easily accessible, i would be mad!!!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The Hotel and area where great. All the hidden fees really sucked and during check in the lady at the front desk wasn't very nice when asked questions. Customer service could improve.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Horrible stay, bathroom was so small you practically had to stand in shower to turn around, elevators very slow- took 20 min to get elevator in lobby, extra charges at check out were unexpected, no closet in room, older hotel."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"i never book a hotel that has a resort fee. there was no notice that a fee of 20/night would be charged in addition to the room fee. i will never use hotels.com again. never, never, never."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"My stay was ok... I didn't like the fact that I was promised a room with double beds and ended up being given a single,corner,slanted room. Also, they didn't have my reservation when I arrived. I felt as if I was given the bottom of the barrel in room accommodations. I didn't like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up or take us back to the airport."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The Hotel itself is located in the original downtown. It is convenient to World Market. The staff are pleasant and the Casino was well looked after. An electrical breaker shorted in the room and was moved at 3am was moved to another room...showed up to the new room...Surprise! Walked in at 3:30 Ooops! Occupied. Went back to front desk. Reassigned to a suite which was appreciated..I was glad I did it alone and did not have family with.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Had a bad experience staying at plaza hotel Las vegas. As I was taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off. I reset the button on the electrical wall receptical turned on the light and it immediately turned off as if there was a short in the electrical system. I called the front desk and explained to the receptionist the issue I was having. She said that she had to email a tech to come in for repairs and when I asked her how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know. Due to minimal sunlight into the bathroom I had no other choice but to shower in complete darkness. I was in Vegas for a family reunion so I was gone most of that day and about 3hrs after I left the room I got a call from the front desk to inform me that there was a water leak in my room and that they were moving us to the room next door. What scared me the most was the fact that the water leak might have been causing the light to short out and that there might have been a possibility of getting electrocuted while I was showering. The next two days that I stood there I was uncomfortable showering. I would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay there again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was a very comfortable and I would stay again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It took way to long to check in 45 minutes. Valet Service and Bell Hop Service were not clearly marked, took 45 minutes to find out we were in the wrong location for those services. Not enough Bell Hops or luggage carts for use."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I have to give this hotel a negative review. The reason why is they would not valet park my Mercedes Sprinter van. So I had to park at there overflow parking lot down the street. I have no problem with parking there UNTIL I find out they charged me 20.00 a day on top of my room cost. The manager said she could do nothing about the parking charges. And just a note they had oversized spots in the valet lot.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"i always enjoy stay there, the only thing i was surprice that i did not have coffee maker or coffee in my room, other than that it was great."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Front desk was rude. Noise level very high (I guess to be expected for area) Room smelled stale found 1 of standing brown water in tub
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I had a big surprise when I checked in of 179. resort fee. Plus I was told they had refrigerators when I called and they wanted to charge me 20 per day. I have my grandbaby there and needed to store milk. I did not rent the refrigerator. I will never stay there again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was great
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Hotel was great! Great location to Fremont Street experience and room was nice and upgraded. Will stay there again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"My boyfriend planned a trip to take me to Vegas for the first time, I was so excited until I got dressed up casual but still nice enough for dinner it was a red fitted dress past my knees with black heels and I had just had my hair done and curled. On our way through the casino floor security tool me to the front desk and evicted me from the hotel for prostitution. I have never been so hurt in my life, I had book our rooms a month in advance for 2 nights, I am a certified caregiver in Washington state. I asked TO SPEAK with the manager who did nothing. We were parked on the garage fifth floor and I had to carry all my luggage as I could not walk on the casino floor. They did not refund any of our money or even say they were sorry, I asked them to show me the video of the casino floor and was told they have no audio. I left crying and I will never return and thanks to there rude and unprofessional staff I never even wan to go to Vegas again."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I loved my stay with my Boyfriend we had a blAst thanx for the great memory
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Its easy access to Freemont experience. Several good casinos and lots of good eating.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I stay at this Hotel often as part of my local staycation spots. This time I was a little disappointed. Check in was great as always but when I got to my room it was still occupied and dirty! I went back downstairs to advise the front desk clerk and she was questioning me as if it was my fault the room was dirty and still occupied. She keep telling me the room shows her available and clean and wanted me to go back to the room and wait for housekeeping. I was furious, but didn't explode. I simply told her to get their housekeeping staff in order and to do their job correctly, find me another room or cancel my reservations. She gave me another room. I go back upstairs and that room was clean but had no towles, soap or bathroom tissue. By this time, I'm extremely tired and frustrated. I just called housekeeping and had someone bring the items missing in the room. I will be submitting a formal complaint to the company/hotel directly because that is just unacceptable. I like the hotel and want to continue using them but after this my interest has changed."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"I was here on business, for the most part. Everything was going well, until last night. On my last night I decided to go to bed early, so I took my medication and as soon as it hit me the fire alarm on my floor started going off. I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening, and then my key decided not to work. So I had to go back down again, and have security take me back up. I was completely exhausted, and security was on top of it! Thank god for them! I will stay there again, that's for sure, Jeff Rutkin"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Front desk was slightly rude
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Hotel is nice and clean, but the AC unit was incredibly loud and annoying. The first night I could not fall asleep because of that thing. Also the elevators are really slow for the parking garage. Wish there was a refrigerator too. Other than that it was a good hotel in a good location."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"The Plaza was just your run of the mill hotel. Upon entering the casino area to check in, we were hit with a horrible smell. We had to walk from one end to the other to check in. The smell was everywhere! The ceiling looked as though it could cave at any time. The smell made us all nauseous gave us headaches. The room was clean, the beds okay. The location was great to hit Fremont street. We chose not to eat, gamble, or do anything in the building, but walk to from our room. Pretty sure we won't be staying there again."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We have stayed in downtown Vegas a lot and love to try new hotels when I heard that the plaza had a new pool I decided to give it another try. I had problems with the front desk been rude well this time it was no different I asked for non smoking and it specifically says it there and they stated they had no non smoking rooms available anymore and I had my daughter with me now I know that Vegas is no place for a child but last minute my babysitter cancelled and we had everything arranged to go so we had to. So I tell them and she says that she has only smoking but that they would send someone to deodorize my room I waited an hr no one shows I call the front desk to see what's going on they said she was on her way and again no one shows after half an hour I called again and again until I got tired no one ever showed so I sprayed the place with my own stuff and it smelled better I don't understand why am asked what kind of room I want if am going to be given whatever they want not caring upon my request
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Our stay was a quick one. Just one night. We enjoyed all the downtown Vegas had to offer. Our only complaints about the room were that the restroom did not have a vanity mirror. Our other complaint was that our favorite spot downtown no longer existed.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,We loced iur stay at La Plaza. The only thing I was disappointed was not having room service
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was good but little bit like 5 miles far from vegas strip. In the room atleast they should keep coffee. But nothing was there
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Wash very good
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Loved this hotel and casino!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,bath tub filled with water ..did not drain....sink the same...stains on hard surfaces.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Ugly dated Room adjoining room door not Secure. Didn't feel Safe!
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The bathroom was really tiny toilet right next to tub...tub had hair in it. The sink and mirror was dirty and had hair. The TV had 5 channels that we could get..I had booked a king deluxe but got a queen regular room instead but still paid same amount for deluxe.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,The rooms were comfy and nice. Elevators are old and very slow. Band at Fremont Street Experience played until 2am. Not good if you're into late night though.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for the Life is Beautiful festival in September. We had a wonderful stay and Plaza exceeded our expectations! Check in was a breeze, and every staff member we encountered was very friendly, some even making small conversation with us. The rooms/hallways/elevator areas were always kept very clean. We only made it to the pool once, but wished we could have spent more time down there! Plenty of chairs to relax in, roulette tables, and a food truck...its a cool little hang out spot! We absolutely would stay here again!"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Rooms not clean - problems getting them cleaned properly all week No refrigerator no microwave no coffee machine - safe was about it. but charges of resort fee
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"It was beyond my expectation that Front Desk people has a not my job, go ask someone else attitude. But then you can rely on the Cleaning Lady, because she can't speak/understand English. All can say is I do not know, go downstairs when you ask her a question. Also the big NO..NO for me is she open my door with her own keycard without asking and that was 9:00 in the morning. Oh I like the lay out of the bathroom but the sink is too high ( square sink on top of the counter) NO FRIDGE / NO MICROWAVE / NO COFFEE MAKER (20.00 per Night if you request one coffee maker they don't have Tea)"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was horrible. No non smoking rooms with small children. No offer to upgrade I had to ask them was told one price to upgrade and ended up being more. Worse customer service ever for someone who stays at that hotel a lot
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"This stay was great as we had a huge family reunion ao it was over 50 of us at the same hotel. The only downfall was it was summertime and the pool was closed, so the kids were upset they had nothing to really do."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was great my favorite place every time I go vegas..
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I booked prior to arriving and requested a non smoking room and upon arrival I received a smoking room.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,I have stayed here about 20 times and this was the absolute worst all they care about is the money they charged us 20 for parking on top of the hotel room and then 20 to get back out of lot
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"Lively neighborhood, great atmosphere"
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was nice comfortable I would do it again
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,My room was very spacious and clean. The location is great with Fremont St right out your door. The rooftop pool and bar was very nice and bartender and security staff very friendly. The casino itself is lacking and needs updating there is just no life in there compared to other casinos in the area.The Internet seemed to work very well. Overall I would stay here again.
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,"When I checked in, I was surprised with a 50 deposit that was not in my budget. Then I was given a King room when I requested 2 queens. Got moved to the new room only to find out our keys wouldn't open that door and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue. The front desk person had an attitude the whole time. When we finally got into our room, (almost an hour after arriving) and it was dirty. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, sink, and tub. Also, I found dried urine on the floor by the toilet. When I called the front desk to complain, the night manager had an attitude. They sent someone to clean and he didn't know what he was doing. He was rude to me. He picked up the hair, but didn't use any cleaners. I will not be staying at The Plaza again. I DO NOT recommend anyone else stay there either."
Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,It was convenient for what we needed as we were there for the Miss USA pageant so we weren't in the hotel very much. We basically got what we paid for which was fine.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"It was a great one night stay. The front desk staff was great, convenient access to food and snacks in the lobby, and the hotel has a nice bar area also."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"We stopped here on the way to Key West. Warm welcome and a very nice room away from I95. The room had a sitting area with TV wet bar, fridge and coffee maker. A separate bed area with king bed and bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. If in the area I would stay here again."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The hotel was ok dated but good . The only real problem was that there was a lot of out of control kids ripping and running in the halls.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,oops ken just told me if i asked for a microwave they would give one  :-)
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"We enjoyed are stay. Hotel staff was very sweet. Hotel was very clean. The only thing was the air from the a/c was not cooling the way it should have, but other than that I would stay there again!"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I was just there for one night and it was a good night, Wish I had more time there then I probably can give you a better answer to this question"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Very upset because my reservation should of been until the 1 and when I found out that it wasn't I went down to ask for help the first gentle man said I had to pay a xtra 249 and I told him I did not have that money I beg him if he could do anything for me and he said to come down and speak to manager did not sleep all night thinking about it when down the next day and told them what happen and crying that's did not have that amount of money if the could please beg them to do something for me and the only thing that they said was that they will give me till 2 to check out so I had to asks nephew from Connecticut to please let us borrow money and transfer me the 278 dollars otherwise I will get kicked out and he did in which now I have to pay for that money no compassion at all after we stayed 8 nights with our 2 girls and we did not bother at all most of days actually 6 out of 8 days we did our own cleaning I was not asking to live it to us for free just the prizing of before because we did not have the money but the hotel staff did not care
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Hotel staff were amazing! From the time we checked in and when we left. Everyone very friendly, informative, and just all around genuinely nice"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Stayed for 3 days...Upon check in found a wet, dirty towel in the bathtub, called and it was taken care of...don't think they cleaned the tub, just removed the towel. Called to complain about the air - the room was very stuffy all night. The engineer came and checked it out, told me I set the temperature wrong and fixed... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"While I stayed at this hotel for business, I asked the guy at the reception desk for a folder and was told that there weren't any. The next day I asked for a stamp to mail a letter and was again told that there weren't any. The coffee maker in the room didn't work. I left a note about this,... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The front desk staff was amazing all request were filled within 30mins of request. The restaurant staff was great as well only ordered drinks (yummers). The bed was extra comfortable and lots of pillows. I traveled with two children their only complaint was the pull out couch was hard and lumpy. We used some pillows and blankets to make it as comfortable as possible. There are a few abandoned buildings makes the hotel feel like a ghost town but I enjoyed the absence of the crowd. Overall this was a great stay!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,amazing stay wonderful staff.rooms were spacious service was great area around the hotel was very nice well kept.rooms were cleaned everyday.if we ran out of things in our room we just had to call.i would recommend this lovely hotel to every one who is traveling to West Palm or anywhere there is a Doubletree
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,It was a short overnight stay with my husband. The Hotel lobby was clean and comfortable. The pool area was under construction closed (which was NOT mentioned on their website). The work was very loud and messy. We were awakened 9am by the fire alarm and had to be evacuated. All of the guests were standing outside of the hotel for almost an hour before anyone explained what was going on. The shower had mold in the caulking. We stayed in the Junior Suite with a small living rm and dinette area. The bed was comfortable and the room was big enough for 2.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Room was good except that my room faced the highway and heard cars and trucks go by thru out the night
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The hotel is conveniently located near the airport. I never heard the airplanes when I was at the hotel. The bed wasn't the most comfortable for me but the room was clean. The staff was extremely friendly.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,bland for the money to stay overnight.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Great customer service
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The room and service was excellent. The breakfast was spacious and clean. The food was well-prepared and was ready as advertised (0600). They offered a ride to City Place that had shops, restaurants, movie theater and watering holes."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Gave my mind rest and peace while going through bereavement.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I was so disappointed! It was my girl birthday, so I call them to make sure that I got a large bathtub and a king size bed. When I got to my room, I had the smallest tube in the world. Remind you that I'm 6'1' and a big dude. They also gave me a small double bed. My leg was hanging out the bed the whole night. To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room. I once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room that gave me everything I wanted in orlando, a king size bed and clean sheet. I wish I could get my money back. NOT HAPPY"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,It was well worth the trip I enjoyed my stay I went to see a comedy show at the Improv at city place.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Everything about our visit was great. We were greeted by a very nice staff member. Our room wasn't ready (we arrived early) but she was able to find us a room available even though it wasn't the room that we pre-checked in for. The room was nice and clean. The restaurant service was always good (we ate there every morning... More
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Unprofessional staff, they either don't know the process of deliberately don't inform for charging higher room rate.

They said I had to make a call within... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"They list that their double rooms have two queen beds, not true. They're more like a big twin bed.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Nice accommodations, good location, helpful staff. The room was clean and had plenty of charging stations and also a new tv. Restaurant downstairs had complimentary apps every night too which was nice. One thing that really made the stay was that every night I'd get a water from downstairs. I was never charged. Not about the cost or anything I... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,I arrived on my vacation that i booked months in advance to lay by the pool and do nothing for a week. The pool happened to be closed.. nobody told me this.. even when I checked in.didn't find out till I went down in my bathing suit. Then they didn't want to refund me so I could stay elsewhere. Ridiculous
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Stayed one night last week while in WPB for meetings. Staffs are nice, both front desk and restaurant. I was first given a room that wasn't completely cleaned or if they were previously given to other peripheral. When I walked in, there was a high eaten cookie on the night stand and a bag of other things on the desk.i... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The hotel room is comfortable and spacious. I lived here for a week and the room service is nice. Selection of breakfast is limited and no complimentary breakfast unlike embassy suites. The desk assistants were helpful too.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"My hubby was traveling for business and I met him in West Palm for his last leg of his trip. The hotel was set up through his work after we were struggling to find anything (decent) under 350/night. (2 weeks ago he paid 120 for a cockroach of a place...time of year, I suppose). The staff was super nice, room... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"First, the cookies are to die for. The hotel has been remodeled and looks great. The have a full bar and restaurant as well.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The rooms and bathrooms were clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Staff was friendly. I will stay there again. I became a HHonors Member right away. I would recommend this hotel or any Hilton hotel to my family and friends.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The breakfast was delightful, as was the view to the west from my window. I was very comfortable. I found it very easy to get into West Palm east of I85. I ate well, slept well, and left relaxed. My objective for a Florida vacation was met."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,I loved the fact that we were able to check in early once we got there at 11am. Great staff the property was close to everything.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Great place great workers very friendly,clean will go back. Close to downtown Palm Beach a must visit, lion country safari awesome for kids and it has a small water park they also have a huge water park called the Rapids my kids loves it. The pillows were a plus :)"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"My only complaint was that the lobby and my room were pretty stuffy at first and had a bit of an odd smell, but my room was great when I turned the AC on after about an hour. Maybe if they had the air turned on to begin with it would have been better."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Convenient, quiet, clean hotel. Close to Airport and I-95. Easy to navigate from here to shopping mall and downtown West Palm. The on-site cafe had nice food selection, good seating, friendly staff."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Recent remodeling was well done. We had a junior suite at very reasonable rate. Hilton Diamond perks included decent breakfast. Had shuttle available to airport and City Place. I recommended hotel to nearby company which has many visitors.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Very good place to stay although they do not offer breakfast but overall in car everything is fairly close

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Perfect place we stayed for 3 night had no regets front desk welcomed us with a warm friendly smile.and the restaurant guys were friendly,kept us entertained,while we having our breakfast.the one great thing is the city center is close by.theres tons of restaurant and night clubs to party at.hey you better check this property its worth a vist."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,In the middle of nowhere and the shuttle only goes to airport and one stop at the very beginning of cityplace.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The hotel was very good, with a free shuttle bus that went to the airport and city place. If your staying for a vacation my advice is to hire a car as hotel too far to walk to beach and any other attraction. Overall a very good experience"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"For our stay we found the hotel met Hilton's standards for cleanliness, design, responsive staff, and general comfort level. In those terms, I'd give the hotel five stars. However, more generally, the hotel is not close to restaurants or activities -- it stands in the middle of a business park. Our standard room and especially bathroom were on the rather... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I travel for work all the time, so I stay at more hotels than I'd like to admit. This location has friendly staff, clean rooms, and great service. Overall, my experience was very positive! I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in the area."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"It was a good room, especially for 1 person. And for it being a double tree hotel, it was amazingly affordable."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The hotel was good for the price television wasn't working. The staff was very friendly, and the pool was great. I would definitely stay again if they can get the television working. Overall I give the hotel a B"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Bravo! When I first posted a review the hotel was going through a renovation of the cafe, fitness center and bar, although it took longer than expected the final product turned out to be excellent! You will be impressed by the improvements but the highlight of the hotel is the staff. If you are eating in the cafe ask for... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,have just checked in. the staff seems nice but had to ask for the bedsheet and pillow covers to be changed as they were dirty.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Loved the space in our room and the jetted bathtub was amazing!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I was impressed with this hotel. It was clean, quiet and staff was pleasant. You are even offered a warm cookie upon checkin in which I took full advantage of. I paid under 100 for the night and it was an awesome deal. It's is about 15 minutes from the City Walk where you can shop and eat. The hotel shuttle takes you to and from the airport and City Walk for free. However, it does not take you to the beach. You will need to take a taxi there. Other than that, I have no complaints on my stay. I highly recommend this hotel."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,This hotel is close to the airport. Rooms are clean and staff is friendly. They had a fire and we had to evacuate. They didn't seem to worry about guess much. That's my only issue.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"As a Diamond HH member, I was impressed that the staff had already upgraded me to a suite without me even having to ask, even though I had used online check-in. I received the complementary breakfast coupon as well as one for a complementary drink at the bar, which I wasn't expecting - that was great, especially since I have... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Overall the stay was not bad. We were disappointed that the pool was closed during most of our stay. I think that is something that anyone who makes reservations should be made aware of.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,my two friends and i loved it.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The hotel is very nice, rooms spacious and clean. Great pool to swim and lounge. My only complaint (and not a serious one) is the hotel is a little hard to find as it is in a industrial area and blends in with office buildings around it. A better sign that is bigger and not listed with other tenets would... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The neighborhood was not nice so we didn't stick around to swim. Hotel was very nice.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,This hotel is overall great. The true highlight though are the staff here they all are great and provide amazing guest service! Mercedes at the front desk is 5 star any questions or concerns are addressed with the upmost attention! The rooms are delightful as well very spacious and updated look.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Great place. Would stay again.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Room was nice for the price we paid. Not near the water, but it was an easy location right off the 95, and customer service is nice and it was mostly quiet and comfortable. They gave us cookies upon check in and the lobby was clean and inviting. There is not a nice view on the 2nd floor."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Bed Bugs!! Horrible experience. when I first arrived I they gave me such a hard time with the check in. Note that my room was paid for prior to arriving. It took me 3 hours to get everything situated. I mad this reservation about a week ago on a debit card and I've yet to see you deposit for room charges placed back on my card. Then when I finally get in my room into bed I felt something crawling in my ear. On top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs. So not worth the frustration. Never again.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"electrical fire took place at 4 a.m. had to leave our rooms and didnt go back until hour and half later, then went off again because they had to reset it. I am not pleased with how they handled the situation, when checking out the lady asked me how my stay was.....Really Go somewhere else, did not compensate at all."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Everything was great as expected from Double Tree. The location of the hotel is not good if you want to walk outside and have eating and entertainment options. For my purpose it was fine as I car shared to work and back. I would definitely stay at this property again. Very helpful staff, all the ladies on front desk, and the front door staff."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Shuttle drivers were extra helpful, a lady picked me up promptly at airport. A young man named Dee Was very helpful and kind on my way back to airport. I ordered a shrimp caesar salad from room service and the shrimp tasted like they were from a five star restaurant! The lady who delivered was so friendly and helpful. She made me feel right at home. Her name is Sharon. The food was delivered so quickly! I was shocked and pleasantly surprised. In the am my coffee pot did not work so a man from the restaurant brought me a pot of coffee. Amazing staff! Comfortable bed....wish I could have stayed forever! Oh my goodness...the huge cookie is the best I ever had!!"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I stayed at this awesome hotel for only one night but was treated like I had stayed there 100s of times before that night.

From the upgrade to the executive suite, to the front desk watching for my business client, to... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Clean hotel with friendly staff.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Hotel was very comfortable. Went with another couple and the front desk was able to get our rooms close together despite being almost full.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This is a very nice Doubletree. It appears to be pretty new. Room's are nice. Breakfast was very good, and as always the cookies are great. I would recommend this hotel. Room's have a small refrigerator. My only complaint would be the bathroom is a little small."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Staff were polite and extremely helpful! Even with what seemed to be 100 people there for a near by convention, the staff were still attentive to us. Location is not the best if you want everything footsteps from the hotel but the short drive to City Place was convenient and had all the shops and entertainment we needed when we wanted a break from the meetings."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Comfortable hotel, Staff is caring. Exceptional service every-time I visit. Frank (driver) and Daniel (server at restaurant) go out of their way to make your trip a pleasant one. Of course the hotel rooms have to clean and comfortable, however, it is people like Frank and Daniel that make the stay a pleasure."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Was upgraded to Jr Suite. Room spacious, quiet and comfortable. Would have liked breakfast included, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Was attending an event in Wellington, so this location was perfect. Heard no noise from airport or from other guests. I would recommend this hotel."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"nice after the renovations, clean rooms and local to beach! front desk seems a little uppity (relax its only a double tree!) but all around staff is nice and pleasant."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The whole hotel was just extremely hot. It took us running the wall unit at the lowest temperature for the room to be mildly comfortable and we had to request a fan at night so that we could sleep well. When you close the door to the bathroom you automatically start sweating, had to leave the door open just to... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I usually enjoy my stay at Doubletree, whether it's business or pleasure. This was no exception. I had some minor issues with this location but nothing that would deter me from continuing to support this brand. (Cookies make everything better!) The location is slightly off the beaten path but still close enough to downtown to enjoy the area. My only... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"After being told by the 800 that we would have a rollaway, we were informed at check in that we wouldn't get one.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Very conveniently located, great shuttle service, professional staff, comfortable and spacious rooms. Good value for the money. Love the cookies and water for the Hilton Honor members. Will definitely recommend."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,A/C was loud and did not control humidity. No sound barrier on ceiling sounded like elephants walking upstairs. Bathrooms were small. Door to room did not close securely unless forced. Linens and pillows uncomfortable. Alarm clock did not light up at night. Will never stay at a DT again. Will not recommend to family or friends.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I needed a nice place to go for Valentines Day and looked all over West Palm Beach for the best hotel that would be able to fit my requirements for the night.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,A convenient stop for flying in n put of PBI
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The hotel was pleasant. I gave the cleanliness only 3 stars bc there were two dirty towels on the night table when we arrived. The room itself was comfortable, we enjoyed the sitting area which had a big tv."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The front desk employee was great. The room was very nice. HOWEVER, was very disappointed with the hotel when it came to the continental breakfast. Most hotels its free. This breakfast cost 15. Everyone is eating thinking its free, then we get hit with a very large bill. There were no signs stating it costs."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Travel on business and this is by far one of the best at understanding the plights of the traveling public. New bar and restaurant area is very nice and upscale compared to the non renovated hotels. Can't beat the location for convenience to downtown and the airport. The staff is awesome!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Perfect for overnight near the airport. Extremely helpful staff. Airport shuttle which picked us up at car rental site the eve before flight. Good restaurant, reasonably priced. Clean comfortable rooms, perfectly laid out for the business traveller. This hotel is well thought out and an excellent bargain."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Great except one flaw. Three of the four days I stayed, my key card refused to work. I spent quite a while standing in the hall waiting for a staff person to come up with a fresh key card and let me in. It turned out the key card reader in my door was dirty. Kind of an inconvenience, and it took til day 3 before they figured it out."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"We had 2 rooms, as we were there for a wedding. Both were clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful. Close to everything. Love the chocolate chip cookies. Free wifi since I am an HHonors member. Would go there again if I was in the area."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,my room is clean and staff has been nice so far!!! i would recommend staying here!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"We came in, checked in, and went to our room. Ordered pizza, showered and slept."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I had a great experience so long as you know that there is a mini fridge in the room before hand, remember to ask for your free cookie, don't forget your HHonors card in your other purse and be patient to get onto the internet, it can really be a struggle. Otherwise, a nice peaceful place to sleep."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This was the first time I have visited the doubletree hotel in west palm beach. After the three hour drive in the rain, my group and I were very frustrated. Once we came to the counter to check in, Mercedes and Gessica sensed our frustration and were extremely helpful. They were so gracious and kind and next time I come... More"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Myself, husband, and two year old daughter booked 4 nights at the double tree. It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"for a smoke free facility, room smelled like smoke, even worse when the ac was turned on."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,It was excellent! Upscale and beautiful property!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,My stay here was absolutely amazing!! The staff was the best especially Mercedes and Evelyn. They made me feel extremely welcome with warming smiles and great conversation. Will definitely be back!!!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,We had a great experience with the West Palm Beach Doubletree. The breakfast included with our stay was a full breakfast with great quality food. The staff in all areas were extremely helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay again.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Really lucked up to get a room at this hotel. It was very convenient to where I needed to be.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Stayed here before departing on Vacation abroad. The location is great, staff are friendly helpful, but the hotel is in dire need of a refit some TLC. Shuttle service to City Place is a nice service very well organized."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Excellent stay from start to finish. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful including the shuttle drivers.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"It's 3am and I'm trying to sleep the night before our cruise. My neighbor though is awake, and by no fault of their own are keeping me awake. See their TV is on...and they're chuckling and talking every once in a while. The problem is that the door connecting our rooms must be made of plastic wrap because I can here every word. The hotel was clean and comfortable, but if your neighbor snores or falls asleep with the TV on then I hope you brought sleeping pills. This was really unfortunate, we normally really enjoy doubletree hotels, but we cannot recommend this stop."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Very happy stay, very clean, very friendly staff and employees."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This hotel is very nice and the staff is friendly. I will stay there again. The breakfast needs some attention, not a very good selection of breakfast items... Not the Hilton quality I have received at other Hilton double tree hotels. That being said, I did not leave hungry.. Like I said it was ok.... Not great."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The hotel from the outside looks a little outdated however, once you enter the building a very nice updated lobby and room await.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Stayed here last year and it was a great experience, this year not so much. Will not stay at this property again. The rooms were not very clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills."

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Very courteous staff Girl at front desk could smile a little bit A little abrupt However overall pleasant stay. Breakfast was very good Thankyou
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,i will say the staff is friendly and helpful the room looked just like the pictures very clean the cookie they give when you check in is really yummy the bed was super comfortable! however the had to pay to make a local phone call almost a 1 for a 2 minute call then you have to pay 5 a day to use their wifi i was like i thought all hotels had at least free wifi no the breakfast was super high 11 for juice and a muffin no microwave in the room i have been to really cheap hotels they had all of the above and it was complimentary the pool close at 11pm so no late night dips i was unhappy other than the comfortable bed and nice staff bottom line be ready to spend an extra 50 to 60 for a stay of 2 people to eat and use their wifi i will not stay at this hotel again
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"We enjoyed our stay,continental breakfast was outstanding especially the employee's serving us! Just one note, pillows were very small,queen pillows are more comfortable. Overall 4 **** Thank you, The Miro's"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Everything was great! Check-in went smooth and we even got a warm cookie as a gift. Nice lounge and nice bar. Room was good sized and clean. You get so much more then what you pay for, and that is awesome! :) would stay at that hotel again, no doubt!"
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This Double Tree Hotel is not like the hotel I went to a few years ago in another city. I expected a more higher class of hotel. It does not hold up to what a Hilton used to be. This hotel did not have a TV guide in the room nor on the TV screen for guests to know what was playing in Florida. That was the biggest complaint. There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future. I am sure the Hilton's are first class not the ones they attached their names to."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This hotel was very clean. Very nice room. Good bed. The staff was friendly helpful. The price was high, but not bad for this area. Great breakfast a little confusing on ordering. The gentleman did an amazing job but could of used more help. Good WI-FI Nice pool but too cold to swim this time. Would stay there again."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The staff is friendly but this Double Tree seems more like a Hampton. The pool area was sloppy. Towels provided for pool are not thick and thirsty. Fitness center is okay. I expect more from a Double Tree and this one did not meet that expectation. The breakfast was okay but the muffins looked lovely but taste was lacking. They... More
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the DoubleTree for a full week.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,nice
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"I was welcomed by a very pleasant and professional staff. I had just flown in and lost my phone at the TSA check in the airport from where I took off, so I was a bit agitated. I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Bathroom could of been cleaner. Front desk and shuttle drivers can be a bit more professional.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Our stay here was great overall. The room was clean, nice and up to date. The only problem we had was the a/c. The fan would shut off and on about every 3 minutes. So between that and the loud road noise we had trouble sleeping. I would suggest asking for a room away from I-95."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,This was a very nice hotel and was located near shopping in town. The staff was very helpful for the most part a few bad attitudes did not spoil our trip :-) the breakfast buffet was above-average for hotel breakfast and I would definitely stay here again!
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"The facility, rooms, cafe, cafe service, cleanliness, and fitness center were all exceptional.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Good hotel in line with what you would expect from the Hilton brand. Nicely situated between airport downtown. Fitness centre is adequate although you can end up peddling in the dark alone if on an exercise bike as lights are on a motion sensor. Only real complaint is that you get 2 small complimentary bottles of water on checkin... More
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,They left the same sheet from the night before. They didn't have a microwave in the room. They house keeping people look like they were rushing in my room. They didn't organized anything in the room or take out the trash we had the night before.

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,The hotel was great. We ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. It was recommended that we get the fish dinner that came with asparagus and coconut rice. The fish: horrible...not edible...maybe even microwaved. The coconut rice:delicious The asparagus: straight out of a can or just plain old they were bitter and gross. The waitress apologized and gave us a free dessert. Key Lile pie......smh
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"This hotel is a pleasant surprise and I will be back. Right off I95 but that is no problem with noise (the hotel guests are more of a problem especially noisy kids). I don't think they allow dogs that is good and keep the rooms and grounds clean. They offer breakfast and staff is very attentive, Wi-Fi free and great... More"

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Good for short business trip. Too close to the highway for romantic get away. Most of the employees do not smile. Nothing beats a sincere welcoming smile when checking in at a hotel after a log drive or a long fly. This should be the minimum of any basic training for any hotel employee.
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,My flight into West Palm Beach landed at close to midnight. I called the hotel for the shuttle and the phone was answered on the second ring. She told me the shuttle would be there in 10 minutes and it arrived even sooner than that. Upon arriving at the hotel I found out that my reservation was not in the... More

Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Visiting family in the area for Christmas, we stayed at this hotel. Staff was nice at both check in and check out. Loved the cookie at check in! Room was clean, updated and somewhat quiet for being right off I-95. The AC made a lot of noise but other than that, very nice place to stay."
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,Only one of the desk attendants was somewhat rude but otherwise EVERYTHING was perfect! Id come back. :) They offered a shuttle service to and from the airport as well as to City Place which is a huge plus as Ubers can get pricey lol
Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,"Was taken here after an evening flight was cancelled out of PBI. It was very much a middle of the line hotel. The staff told me it was within easy walking distance of City Place, etc., but that's not accurate it's somewhat of a distance on the other side of I-95 take a cab! Overall OK, but I wouldn't stay...

We always have a great... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,I paid to park and couldn't find a park when we returned from Disneyland..Hotel staff gave me valet which was great..
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We always pick Marriott name because even in lower priced hotel the bed is always the best, this was not. Took two days and we had to call for extra soap and the computer wouldn't let us get boarding passes, so had to go behind front desk. While standing there I was asked by other guests how late the pool was open. Funny!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"It is a great family hotel, with spacious suite rooms, a great pool, and close proximity to Disneyland."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Loved having a suite plenty of room for our family of 5. The beds are awful, hard as a rock. The pool is a little small for a hotel of this size and in the shade a good portion of the afternoon. It's a cheap Uber ride to the parks and Target is directly acrossed the street."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We were pleased that it was close to Disneyland, we enjoyed the pool and the hotel very much. Family friendly..."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Nice property. All rooms are suites, but didn't have a terribly expansive feeling. Having said that, there's plenty of room for a couple. I was traveling solo with a once night convenience stop in my former and long time stomping grounds of Orange County. Friendly front desk staff, with a nice acknowledgement of my Marriott Gold status. No upgrade, but... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,You just stay one night. But the children said the bed was very comfortable. But i heard the shower head was dripping until i fell asleep
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"My family and I started staying here years ago when our oldest were just little guys. We have loved it ever since.

As our family has grown and the addition of siblings having an all you can eat breakfast that actually offers breakfast (omelette bar,... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Was disappointed to see my bill and the 15 charge for parking. The 15 isn't the issue, it's the fact that at check in I was given a card to place in the windshield overnight. Not once did the hotel employee mention a fee for parking."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"This was a great family friendly hotel that offered many dining options such as room service, a restaurant on the ground floor, as well as a short walk (as in--cross the street and you are at Red Robin, Outback, Joe's Crab Shack, and Oggi's), AND a Starbuck's in the lobby. There is a shuttle to Disneyland for a small fee... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,stayed for 3 night and was nice. hotel was busy but had quiet night for seeing so many families. staff was friendly and helpful
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Unfortunately king bed was hard and uncomfortable, so not a good night's sleep. The pull out bed was really bad. The head of the bed was lower than the foot of the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent. Also, the bed wasn't made and there were no linens, so I had to call for them. The mattress cover had old blood stains so that had to be changed out also. Was very disappointed because the room was clean otherwise and the pool area was nice. But the point of a hotel is to sleep and when the beds suck, it makes the next day miserable."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Do not eat there! Stop and had a light meal at night bad move! Good was awful! Room was ok bed a little hard. The hotel looks like it needs a update! Good for price.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Perfect hotel for Disney Vacation, rooms are large enough for a family of five. Rooms come with refrigerator (a plus), hotel is 15-20 minute walk from Disney Land."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I prefer to stay in Marriotts, however, this one is very outdated and rooms are very dirty. There is also not enough staff present in the lobby for questions, help, etc. Pool area is nice and large but dirty and constantly out of towels. Pool area needs to be monitored more."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The hotel is an excellent choice for a family. The suites are spacious, however the beds needed improvement. They were actually changing the mattresses in all rooms during our stay. The breakfast buffet is a little bit pricey, but convenient. The location is excellent! It is only a few blocks from Disneyland. Will definitely stay again."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Didn't like having to pay for parking. 15 more for overnight parking was expensive.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"had to request complimentary tea, coffee and sugar giving exact amount. Jacuzzi was dirty."

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Wow.... I had a great impression of this hotel upon arrival- friendly, people-oriented, conversational, helpful and attentive front desk staff, clean spacious updated rooms, comfortable beds, sunny inviting seating areas placed all around the hotel, free wi-fi, Starbucks in the lobby, fruit infused water in the lobby, restaurants surrounding the hotel within walking distance...so many perks. But the the icing... More"

Maya checked us in efficiently, and my dad... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"They charge for parking a car and also money for water bottle, no free wi-fi service in room. Price rate is not worth for service"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Excellent customer service, clean rooms, beautiful facilities. From the moment we got there, the bellman taking our luggage and our vehicle, to the lady at the front desk were all very nice. We asked for towels and they were brought to us immediately. I wish we had stayed there longer."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Horrible staff
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Very family friendly hotel and our room was spacious and clean. Location is good with surrounding restaurants and shopping. The staff was pleasant and helpful anytime we had questions. The sales staff went above and beyond for us with our Disneyland trip. Shuttle to and from Disneyland was convenient and was easy to use.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Was amazing
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We spent 5 days at the Marriott Suites, and it could not have been any better. The staff was friendly, and always had great suggestions.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,This is my second stay at this hotel. Previous stay was okay but this time the our room was dirty and dusty. You can see that the walls and head board was dusty and has finger prints. Not good.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"First timers to this property and I was very impressed. Our room was spacious enough for our little party of 4. And more than that, it was clean and in good standing order. It's techinically in Garden Grove, but up the street from DL so it's a great option if you are headed there. No plans for DL this trip,... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Bed was hard as a rock. Didn't get the room we booked on hotels.com and hotels.com said we were booked for three nights but hotel only had us down for two nights. Arrived late at night after driving 10 hours only to find no room for us. The hallways, elevator restaurant were excruciatingly hot! The restaurant sucked... Poor service with lousy hours... Pool was dirty! I'll never stay here again!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,My wife and I stayed here in April for SW Celebration and Disneyland. The suite was very comfortable for two people but might be too small for a larger family. The walk to the Anaheim Convention center was too far for us so we parked across the street and afterwards walked to the Disneyland park. I would definitely stay there... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I travel a lot and stay in Marriott hotels all over the country, this Marriott is my favorite of all.

Every time my family and I go to Disney I stay at this hotel and I tel every person I know visiting Disney this... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Nice to have the extra room for meetings instead of having your bed be in the same room. Staff were pleasant and business like. Keep in mind that parking is an additional charge. Kind of seemed wrong to me since the parking lot was so large. Overall good experience.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,It was wonderful
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Everything was amazing. Room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast in their restuant was delicious and well priced. Tram to take to disneyland was easy and fast! The only complaint is that the walls are a bit thin making sleeping in impossible.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Close to Disney
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Great breakfast crew Leo, Alex, Hasa, Jose, great dinner options, Liz, Kris and chef Hany always on top of the kitchen. Farid has everything else covered for your stay. Can't wait to come back. Reservations with help from Annette, check in with Michelle and Nick always works for me."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Also had to pay for ride to the park but it was a great hotel
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"had issues with A/C unit, BEDS were too small full size only, parking was expensive and there was a charge for WiFi...otherwise hotel was very nice."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,We arrived in OC for an Angels Game and discovered a gem of a hotel when we checked into this great family hotel.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Clean, quiet, great! Will stay again."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We always enjoy our stay here, and it suits us well for visits to Disneyland. Although we didn't partake this trip, the breakfasts are delicious and the Disneyland shuttle is convenient. The front desk staff and housekeeping are thorough and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and clean. Our family of 6 was mostly comfortable, although the queen beds are a bit narrow for two adults. I'm not sure why they feel smaller than other queen hotel beds, but both my husband and I felt we were sleeping on the edge of the bed. Otherwise, we recommend this location highly for larger family groups."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We stayed here for a family vacation to Disneyland. The shuttle service to and from was timely and convenient. Also, loved having several very good restaurant options available to choose from (pizza, seafood, mexican, etc) all within walking distance. Rooms are spacious and most of all CLEAN! The staff was more than helpful. We will definitely stay again."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Now, seriously: You're not in Anaheim to spend maximum quality time inside your hotel. Admit it: You're there for the attractions. Probably Disney. There are hotels that are much closer to Disney. And they are either much more expensive or much less attractive than the Marriott Suites. Here are the big plusses: 1) There is a (paid) shuttle bus from... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Loved the hotel. My wife and I had never had the opportunity to stay at a Marriott hotel, or in a suite for that matter. We arrived early, hours before check in, and the staff were great. The bell men held our bags until our room was ready so we didn't have to carry them around. When we got our room, we had the choice of second floor or eleventh floor. Floor 11 here we come. We were amazed when we walked in the room. Very elegant. The pics on the website didn't do any justice. Very nice.... The only problem with the room was the hardness of the bed. We had a king suite, and the mattress was like sleeping on a piece of plywood. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Stayed here for a couple nights. Overall great area, didn't have really an issue, course it's near Disneyland, may here excited kids at 6-10am once in a while. Wasn't really an issue, parking was alright for not being free. Always spots. Beaches aren't far, there's a nice mall nearby as well as good choices for restaurants. Suite was amazing, overall going to look for this hotel first because we enjoyed it so much for the price"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,A family vacation to visit Disneyland. This hotel is a good location and represents good value.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,We stayed for 4 nights. Hotel is great and very clean.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Locked us out of our room every day!!!. AC DIDNT work!!!! Worst experience ever!! Wifi expensive!

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Very clean and great customer service
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Just wanted to stay here for a night so we didn't have to drive back to San Diego exhausted after a Disneyland trip. Very nice staff, good area, and super close to the parks!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We stayed last weekend and will start by saying the hotel is definitely older and needs updating! I understand it's high season right now, but it's always high season with Disneyland up the street, so eventually Marriott will need to suck it up and get it done! Most in need is the plumbing, which is remarkably substandard. Our tub had... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Professional, friendly and proficient staff. They make you feel welcome and at home. Great location and easy access to Disneyland. The suites are beautiful and very comfortable for everyone. I would stay again."

The night manager gave us a fabulous... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Large rooms close proximity to Disneyland was a great benefit
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The hotel ended up being great. When booking the room we were told that parking was free but upon checkin they told us it wasn't. They did comp the parking but at the same time said that you should not believe the Internet and call the hotel to be sure... What Are you kidding Your not suppose to trust the people who sell the rooms Oh well, after that point everything was really terrific and great. The hotel was great. The breakfast there was great too - particularly a guy named Leo who works in the restaurant. He is terrific and not just to me and my family but to everyone as I watched him do his work. I would definitely stay there again."

The pool was small however was not a major concern... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We booked this room the night before we headed down to Anaheim. When we walked in it was a pretty large suite with living room, walk in shower and good sized bedroom with huge king size bed. We pretty much took the Lyft everywhere we needed to go which wasn't too bad Disneyland was a 6 ride from this hotel. There was plenty of stuff to eat all around the hotel. The only bad thing was you had to pay 15 a night to park at the hotel. since we had to run off we just parked on the street for free. We had a great time during our stay in Anaheim and we will definitely be back to stay in the same hotel if possible"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,I had an excellent experience with this hotel in Anaheim. Extremely close to Disneyland and California Adventure. Close to a lot restaurant and shops.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Hubby had work at the convention center and I tagged along and went to Disneyland. This hotel is walking distance to both if you enjoy walking.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,The shuttle to Disneyland was great. Very punctual. Staff at the hotel were very friendly. Check in/out was so easy. They sell Disneyland tickets in the lobby
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We had the breakfast buffet and our server, Sassan, was the best server I've ever had. He was so attentive and kind. He would look us in the eye and I think he actually cared that we had a great breakfast!! He made my week with him being himself."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Valet guy didn't even help us to bring out luggage to the room. The water was out the day we check out. We called for iron and it never came.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I often come down to Orange County either for work, friends or family. I have stayed in several hotels, on my most recent trip I booked a room at the Marroit Suites in garden grove.. the level of customer service from the front desk team was by far the best. I will now only choose to stay at the amazing Marroit Suites in Garden Grove. Thank you front desk team! :)"

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Excellent .more that I was thinking
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We stayed here while visiting Disneyland this is a great hotel location. You have to catch a shuttle to the park, but it picks up right in front of the hotel and drops off right at the front gates. The hotel is very nice and there's a Starbucks downstairs in the lobby. Great location pretty hotel!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Our family loved our stay at the Marriott Anaheim suites. The beautiful suite was more than enough room for my large family and the staff took such great care of us.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,It was such a great resort. We went on s turn around trip to Disney land California. So we traveled in s group of fourteen total. Rented cars and drive from Az. We left early in the morning and arrived just before the Hayes opppened. After a long fast Disney we were pleased to arrive at the resort and relax. We had a quick check in with no hang ups. They even had us in joining rooms it was perfect!
Anaheim Marriott Suites,My sister I visit Disneyland every other month and we always stay here! The rooms are comfortable and the staff is very welcoming.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We stayed here 1 night to allow us an early start on the day at Disneyland.

Plusses about the rooms include that the suites allow booking a family of 6 into a single... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The room was a bit outdated but spacious. The location is further from Disneyland so it's a lot quieter. However, you can still hear kids running around and laughing at night (naturally, being near the Disneyland). The hotel offers Disneyland ticket sales booth and shuttle (with fees). This would be a good hotel if you travel with family and want... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The hotel rooms were a little dated. Staff was courteous, but sparse. Convenient to have a Starbucks in the lobby. Shower drained slow...had to take a quick shower otherwise you'd be taking a bath. Bed was rock hard, so tossed and turned a lot."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Its okay, but they don't offer breakfast and charge a lot for parking. For parking if you you drive in and go to Disney you must pay hotel parking and Disney parking"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,It was a horrible stay because the room was outdated and old everything was dirty the toilet and the sink had plumbing problems and they ran all night long and bubbled like they were backing off and going to overflow the hallways with smelly and dark and grungy I will never stay here again
Anaheim Marriott Suites,2days great hotel very good staff
Anaheim Marriott Suites,The room was clean we were able to sort of upgrade our room from one King size bed to 2 double beds + one sofa bed suite room!

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Hotel was a good Value and really close to Disneyland. The beds pillows could be upgraded. The shower head needs to be replaced. Overall a good place for my family.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"This hotel is in a great location and has a great staff! Located just down the street from Disneyland and just far enough so that you are not stuck in the extremely crowded areas just outside of the gates, which could leave you frustrated after a long day at the park. Stayed here for a special occasion with my loved... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Device was fine, same with location. Don't waste your time with the shuttle to DisneyLand especially during peak hours. Only have one driver and one bus at peek hours.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"When we arrived at the hotel and pulled-up to the Valet Parking, there was no one to great or help us. After almost 10 minutes we went in to the registration desk for help. We were able to get checked-in by the nice person, but the Hotel Manager was acting as the Bellman and Valet. We finally got help from him to our room but the process took about 25 minutes when there was no line or other customers present. Our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed pillows, sick and bath tub. There was even a Calvin Kline pant sticker stuck on the bedroom door. We stayed two days and informed the staff of the issues, but the sticker was still there when we checked-out. There were food trays in the hallway all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed. I can only assume they retrieve the trays once a day. I can say that the staff was very friendly and helpful, but they seemed very harried all the time."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I travel quite frequently and I must admit the service and accommodations at this hotel is amazing!!! From when I entered the door a bellman greeted me and offered his assistance, as I reached the front desk I was greeted enthusiastically. The room was immaculate, KUDOS to the housekeeping team at this hotel. I especially appreciated the refrigerator, coffee maker... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Pros: Clean room, close to Disney with shuttle service, view from room good, hotel staff very nice and friendly Cons: King bed a little too firm for my taste, sofa bed needs updating. Family of four, I had to request extra towels, blankets and pillows. Room for vending/Ice machine was locked, key didn't work."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The Elevator waiting areas have no air flow they were always hot and stagnet! Parking was always a challenge, they alwys ahd room for taxi's but no room for guests!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I have been staying at this hotel for about five to six years every time I come and visit the Disneyland area.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We have been coming to this hotel for the past five years it's always been comfortable and the location is close to Disneyland. Travis the bell man has always taking care of me and my family, he's one of the top Bellman there, I hope they pay him well for all he does, along with Eli ranks right up there with Travis. As far as the hotel it has had a few updates as far as the hallways with new carpet. But the rooms themselves are getting a little outdated, but still comfortable and clean. We've only been in the pool a few times, it seems no matter what time of year we go it's always cold and the pool area and hot tub is outdated. The Starbucks on location is a nice added touch, a little more pricey and they stopped giving free water like all other Starbucks locations- the Disneyland Starbucks with your annual pass discount is cheaper and they give you free water in their cups if you ask. We will continue to stay here as long as they continue to update the location, and the best touch is Travis and Eli the Bellmans."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We booked this trip as a quick family getaway to disneyland for our kiddos. Upon checking in Nick A, made our experience awesome. With 2 kiddos and several special requests, he took the time to ensure that all of our requests were acknowledged and even made them all possible for us.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,The room was spacious and we had a great time. Very clean and very helpful staff. Store prices are a little high but the hotel was really nice overall. Very close to Disneyland.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Our business group was there all work week. The staff was friendly at all levels. Sasan was over the top attentive during breakfast and made the experience very welcoming. The evening bar staff was also fantastic and knew our drink preferences within one day (is that a bad sign on our group ). Lol

Their breakfast buffet in the morning was... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Enjoyed our stay immensely, the manager has impeccable customer service skills. I called to inform them that we would be checking in late and took the opportunity to make a few specific requests. I was assured that they would do their best but could not make any guarantees. Upon arrival some of our requests simply could not be met. The manager offered other options and we were offered complimentary breakfasts to make up for not having our requests met to the fullest. Wow way more than I have ever received from another hotel. Your manager is definitely worth holding on to, we will definitely be returning to this Hotel. The rooms were clean and spacious, and sound proof, which is very difficult to achieve in hotels these days. Thank you for helping to make our hotel accommodations while in Disneyland truly Magical."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"A truly great hotel with a wonderful amount of space dedicated to each guest. We were there with kids and there were lots of families staying in the hotel. Hotels.com said parking and wifi was free though and that is NOT the case. Be forewarned that you will have to pay 15 a night for self park. The hotel isn't at fault, Expedia/Hotels.com etc misrepresent those costs as free."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We had 4 rooms and one of the rooms had some major plumbing problems on the first night. After some time speaking with the manager, I was able get another room with a better view."

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We had a king suite. The actual bedroom part was not that big and I wish there was a more solid curtain on the door between the living room and bedroom. There's no privacy with a translucent curtain. Bathroom was a decent size, sink area was in the bedroom. The bathroom lacked towel racks. I do like staying here because it's a lil further from Disneyland. The restaurants aren't as inflated. If you're not staying at one of the Disney hotels or right across the street you're going to either catch a shuttle or take a Uber/Lyft which is what we did and worked out well."

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Compared to on-site properties, this one is well worth the short commute to Disney!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Everything was good except for one thing. The airconditioned was not working properly. The heater will turn on for a long period of time. Called the technician several times and he eventually gave up. it was so warm. 90 + degrees inside the room. No windows to open. The hotel was fully booked options for changing room was impossible.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The buffet breakfast at the restaurant is good. If you want amazing service ask for Jose to be your waiter. He focus 110 on serving his customers with a great attitude and a smile, unlike any other waiter I have ever had. In fact, even before I met Jose, I sat in his area and he came over and said...

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Because the name is Marriott I expected certain things. One the hotel would be in good condition with good customer service.

We weren't too happy about the pool because although... More"

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"While the property is about a mile from the DL main gate, the value of the property is pretty good, especially compared to other brands and even other Marriott brands.

Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We stayed here for one night after a day trip to Disneyland. The hotel is fine and the room was fine as well.

One minor problem I had was that the front desk said they'd send up a birthday treat for my son before... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Second visit to this property. Reasonable rates for large one-bedroom suite. Checking in was a breeze and they upgraded me automatically to a nice corner location.

Our family looked forward... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"My experience with hotels in the Disneyland area is that walking distance is a relative term. And I've found that the closer the hotel is to Disneyland, the higher the price and the more worn the property is. The Anaheim Marriott Suites is a great compromise. It is within a mile and a half of the park, but you can... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Just stayed one night with some friends going to an Angels game. Hotel is geared toward Disney visitors and would be a perfect spot if that is your destination.

It is a long walk and... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I thought the breakfast buffet was really great with fresh fruit, yogurt and basic items. What made it really good was Maria S making omelette sto order with almost no oil. She was very friendly and usually most places use way too much oil when they make omelettes. Also our waiter Alex was gave excellent service, even offering us to... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"We enjoyed the hotel its self, close to good restaurants. Good transportation to Disneyland for a small fee. There was a couple of things that were not as pleasant. The toilet ran on and on but they fixed that. Housekeeping didn't clean our room one day. We were going to eat in their restaurant but didn't get any service and ordered room service one morning but it wasn't good at all and very expensive. Other than that the suite was nice, we all slept good and enjoyed the room. I would recommend this hotel, just don't eat there."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,I didn't like the workers in Starbucks...... Very rude and no smile what so ever!
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Due to a last minute issue, we had to more our event (400 people!) to this hotel with just THREE business days notice. They pulled off everything brilliantly! They have the best, staff - hard working and overall happy people. There is NO other place I'd have an event, than at THIS location. Ask for KIT, she's the best!!!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"The customer service at this hotel was impeccable..from the guy working valet, to the young lady who checked me in. When I stay at Hotels, I expect at a minimum good customer service....here, I received GREAT customer service. The rooms were clean and the location is perfect. This will be my hotel of choice when visiting Orange County."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,I loved this hotel! Very family oriented with a Disney feel to it. The rooms were excellent and clean. Beds were very comfortable. Has a Starbucks in it!!! Also has a gift shop with all the little extras you may have forgotten at home. Has a shuttle to and from Disney that picks you up right in front of the... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Great location. Was clean except the couch could use a cleaning. Lots of restaurants walking distance. Pool was nice and warm. Friendly staff and very accommodating. Starbucks instead which is great. I wouldn't waste your money on the breakfast unless its free, lots of other choices nearby."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,I like the fact that it's all suites. Separate sleeping and living rooms. Perfect for a short stay where you don't need to use a kitchen. Needs some refurbishment for sure. The parking space is a plus. The shuttle to Diseny is very helpful and lasts till 1 am with a frequency of every 30 min. I would stay there... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"the lobby of the hotel are big like luxury hotels that what i saw but I didn't stay at the hotel because they informed me that they are sorry and they offered apology that they don't have rooms for me and they did same with my sister but they offered us free room for me and my sister in another hotel called Embassy Suites Anaheim ,,, we got the room for free... so i can't review this hotel but i can review the Embassy Suites Anaheim"

Anaheim Marriott Suites,Love the size of the room n how it separates the bedroom
Anaheim Marriott Suites,We had a two night stay here and throughly enjoyed it. The suite was great with a 'new' feeling to it. Very centrally located. Be careful to double check maps/ GPS when driving to there ensuring to get the right one as there's a few Marriotts in the area and it can become confusing. The 5 shuttle service to Disney... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"I booked this room thru Expedia. As Marriott normally does for such reservations, they provide you with a room at the stated rate but that room is, IMHO, the worst of the lot. In my case, I was assigned a wheelchair accessible room which meant that shelves and counterspace were slightly lower than normal. This made things more difficult for me since I stand nearly two meters in height and have a bad back. However, I decided I could tough it out given my late arrival and lack of desire to wander back to the front desk and request a change - which I would probably not be provided. Rather interestingly, I have booked rooms at five hotels in the past two weeks. Marriott was the only chain which provided a room of this sort. As for the hotel, it is quite large and the lobby is well lit. I was not aware of the Marriott Suites concept and was pleased with the size and comfort of the room. However, in the process of checking in and checking out, I found the staff to be both efficient but not that friendly. I also did not appreciate the housekeeping staff banging on my room door at 8:00 in the morning. When I did not answer, the staff proceeded to force her way into the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged. Shame on me for not placing the do not disturb sign out prior to my shower. Thankfully, parking was free but internet was not. Another disappointment. There are lots of hotels in the vicinity. I'll try another on my next trip"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,My family and I stayed at the Marriott for a week while on our vacation to disneyland. We ate at the breakfast buffet in the hotel every morning. The service was the best. Specially our server Jose who made our morning much more fun.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Kaela at the front desk was being super and extremely pleasant. She went the extra miles to make it a wonderful stay for me and my parents. The night manager was super nice and helpful too. Just love Kaela. Will always stay again when travel to Anaheim, CA."
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"checked in at 2am in the morning, the sign of ring the bell for service already made me feel bad, then the receptionist so rude, he really sleepy and got mad when i ask if there is valet parking, then he gave me a room with privacy please, the key of course not working, i went back and ask him...

We had exceptional... More
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"There's nothing wrong with this hotel. However, it carries the Marriott name but falls short of the Marriott experience in many ways. Housekeeping: they do a great job keeping the room clean. Be mindful as they knock softly early in the morning then enter. They caught me off guard twice during my stay. One time, I advised them that I... More"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Our stay was amazing. Thank you for making my birthday extra special by upgrading our room.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,Working with Kit to schedule my meeting and accommodate our group was such a success everything was easy and smooth. I would highly recommend the Marriott Suites for your meeting events. I hear it is a very nice hotel and my boss raves about staying at this particular hotel more often.
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"Wow! We really shopped around at different reception venues in the Disneyland area. We were most satisfied and most impressed with the Anaheim Marriott Suites from the first phone conversation to the last e-mail. The hotel is close to the park and to the Crystal Cathedral. The hotel has beautiful facilities and a great staff. Claudia Godoy was a our wedding coordinator (at no extra cost). She was amazing. From a year in advance, I constantly e-mailed and called her about details and questions. We were planning this wedding from long distance and Claudia made everything accessible. She helped me and kept me calm when I felt stressed. Also, for the price, you get more from your money compared to other nearby hotels. Parking for guests is free, dance floor is free, gourmet wedding cake was free, and other items. It was a great investment!"
Anaheim Marriott Suites,"My sister's family and mine got a KILLER deal on a couple suites! Less than 1/3 the price of staying at the resort and just a short shuttle ride, which runs every 30 min, from Disney and California Adventure. Hotel was so close that every day we'd go back to take a break, shower, nap, have lunch, grab sweaters, etc.... More"

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Very cute clean and inexpensive! Convenient to restaurants and shopping! Stayed the night before our cruise! I would definitely recommend staying here staff friendly and water was hot and had good pressure.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"My family and I recently moved to Jacksonville and experienced some unforseen costs along the way. We needed a place to stay and let me tell you, this was the best choice we made! They have free continental breakfast, clean rooms, safe and friendly. Amber, the General Manager, was the best. She really took out a lot of the stress... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"My stay was pretty good, for a sad time with the passing of my favorite Uncle Jr on 4/22/16. I only have two complaints...the first is the a/c did not work too good in my room but it was cool at night and in the mornings. The second one is that there is not a pool at this hotel. Other than that the room, the hotel and the staff was good. I will be staying here when I come back to bury my uncle at the Veteran's cemetery."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,not my favorite place
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,It was a nice hotel and the environment was fine. It was close to the airport so that was convenient.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The hotel was fine for budget accommodations- rooms are clean and offer a microwave/fridge setup- but don't expect anything fancy. The room was good sized but smelled oddly swampy when we arrived, breakfast was rather lacking, and the fitness space consists of two treadmills and an elliptical. Staff was not particularly attentive."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Nice clean hotel with good amenities. The hotel is older and has been maintained fairly well, it is starting to show it's age around the edges. Everything was clean and in good working condition. The one big negative about the room was the matteress, it was old, wore down and needs to be replaced. Very uncomfortable."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"We stayed at this hotel for one night before flying home after a cruise. The room was comfortable, but had a musty smell, and there was a strong odor.... maybe from some kind of cleaning agent.... in the hallway. Nonetheless, it was very convenient to the airport, and the price was hard to beat. We didn't eat breakfast, but had... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The hotel was great for the price! Appeared to be somewhat recently renovated, the room was clean if maybe just a little small. It did the trick, and was fairly close to a nice shopping/dining district. Free airport shuttle service as well"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Booked the place 5 months ago for cruise so we could stay and have shuttle for cruise port in morning. First of all we checked in and the sheets and the Ottoman is seaman stained. Then we paid extra for cruise faster to the fun and the hotel lied to us and said they don't start boarding until 1230(false). The... More
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This hotel was adequate. It had 2 queen beds and a tv. It was relatively cheap. The lobby is small and crowded feeling, it has no pool, the wall paper was peeling off the walls in the room, and the complimentary breakfast was bare bones. There was no where to really eat it either. Pick a hotel with a customer rating over 4 for 20 more if you can find one, it is worth the few extra bucks."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Very clean and nice hotel. The Staff very helpful.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,The service was great. The room size was small based on what we are used to.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Decent worth the price
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"As always the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Hotel was convient to shopping mall and places to eat. Room was comfortable and clean.

But the maintenance staff... More"

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Spent three nights in this hotel. Even though the rooms were small, it was an excellent stay with clean rooms and relatively quiet. Parking was excellent and easily accessible. My only complaint was the inconsistency of the free wifi service. Would definitely consider staying again."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The front desk did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to check in, and did not acknowledge us for the entirety of our stay, the only time they even bothered to look up from their phones or laptops was when my boyfriend walked in with his Navy Uniform, they thanked him for his service and continued whatever they were doing. The woman who cleaned our room was very friendly, and our room was cleaned every day of our stay, regardless of what time we left the hotel. The tub had a hard time draining, but all other appliances worked well. The room only smelled strange when the AC was left off for too long. The area is next to a couple of small shopping centers. Over all, it was not a terrible stay but I will probably not be returning."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I stayed over Valentine's day weekend with my fiance. We got the airplane ticket/hotel package last minute so we weren't picky about where we chose to stay. We had read the reviews (some good, some bad) and we had just decided to see for ourselves. To start, the rooms are small. Don't expect them to be big. And we saw... More"

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This is a very nice hotel, located in a quiet area. It is very close to the airport, and also offers rides to the cruise terminal, at extra cost. Our room was well furnished and very quiet. The continental breakfast area was crowded, but adequate. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Surprise trip to see my son for Fathers Day and his birthday the next day. Needed something inexpensive and nice in a nice area. This was perfect.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,good
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,The bathroom had a horrible smell
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Hotel didn't have basic amenities. Sheets were stained. Door handle broke inside the room and the front desk never came to fix it after I reported it. The outside door in the rear of hotel worked sometimes. I was charged a second time when my card was put on file during check in. I still have yet to receive my refund for that. There were not enough towels and washcloths. Walls are extremely thin and I could hear my neighbors talking.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"close to airport, friendly staff, free wifi. good place to stay."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The best thing about the hotel was service from the friendly staff. The beds were okay but the bathroom was not the cleanest, nor was the coffee machine. I was also not used to the water, which seemed to have a slight odor to it. I've paid the same price for better hotels."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,People at front desk were very nice.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This was a one night stay on a trip to Walt Disney World. We have stayed in other hotels near Jacksonville International Airport and this was not the best. But, for a one night stay it's fine. The breakfast is minimal and there are not nearly enough tables and chairs. Both the night staff and the morning staff were very friendly, courteous and friendly. The woman in the morning told me I was welcome to fill my cooler with ice from their ice machine, but the ice machine itself would only deliver about 1 1/2 buckets of ice before it was out of ice."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Room was clean and comfy beds, close to airport with free shuttle. Free breakfast was just ok...cereal, juice, bagels, muffins, tea coffee.....not very much seating though. Return shuttle to airport was busy due to cruise ship pax. Reception staff were pleasant."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Room was great the price was a bit too much. But the bad part was, there was no pool which sucks about my stay."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,This is the second time we've stay here. We arrived late for a quick overnight stay on a road trip up the coast.

They offered coffee danish and cereal i believe.... More

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Great hotel for the price. It was nice, the staff was very nice, and the bathrooms were clean. I had my infant daughter with me so cleanliness was a priority. It was a pleasant stay. We were visiting family in Callahan and the hotel was right near the freeway. I would definitely stay here again."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. The staff was wonderful. The sheets seem to have had some stains. But overall every thing was great.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"We needed a place to stay while our RV was being repaired. The Plaza was very convenient to where we work. The personnel were very sweet. When we asked for extra service, they were immediate to respond."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This hotel is best in its class of low cost yet relatively high amenity and quality. A small room, but well equipped (microwave, decent TV, refrigerator, decent bathroom, hairdryer, great bed), all you'd expect in a good hotel except size and luxurious decor. All at almost half the price for the better decor. And it was quiet: I heard no one from inside my room, but in the hallway I could hear TVs on as I passed in front of doors While walking down the hallway. Parking was right iutside, so no long walks out obscure doorways to get the luggage in. Elevator was there centrally. Ok breakfast: the advertised continental with oatmeal added. Lots of great restaurants nearby, as well as other amenities I needed (very conomical oil change at RPG, and new tires with great advide at DiscountTire), and right on I-295 to easily get back on the road home. Thanks, Plaza Jacksonville!"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,I will stay again in this hotel.Everything was so perfect...
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Pretty disappointing to say it nicely. Looked like a poorly remodeled microtel. Wall paper Peking in shower along with mold like sunstance in crevices. Walls paper then could hear next door. Towels needed to be bleached and mattresses old and squishy. Staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was extremely light for the price paid. Nothing like the promo picture. Worst stay recommended by hotels.com we ever had!
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,I always enjoy my stay at this property because its close to everything and its reasonably price. The front desk clerk is always very helpful and friendly. The shuttle service is much appreciated. The drivers are professional and you don't have to wait any long period of time to be picked up
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I looked on multiple apps to book a room in Jacksonville close to 95. I saw this place and it was a good deal 54 for a single queen, last minute as I read 3.8 rating on expedia and the 2000+ reviews that 91 of people would recommend. I thought great. Well it's a good rate but it might as... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Me and my Family took a day to visit the Zoo and decided to stand the night at this hotel. What a Great experience!! The staff were so kind. I would do it again.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Booked this hotel for a quick business trip. Located near the airport and close to I95. Very short drive to plenty of food choices. Limited items for free breakfast but I didn't expect anything else. Bed and linens were clean.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Clean, decent breakfast. Staff friendly, helpful. No problems at all with parking, shuttle, charges to credit card, or anything else. Can't beat this place if you're a cruiser or flying out of Jax airport. Don't plan to stay anywhere else."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,My husband and I stayed here the night before our cruise. It was very clean and everyone was nice. It was conveniently located to the interstate and only 15 minutes from the cruise terminal. We enjoyed feeding the fish and turtles in the pond on the property as well. We originally purchased the cruise package with our room but we... More
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"It was a short stay, but we found everything to be very acceptable. The room was very clean,"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,The hotel staff are amazing!
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Hotel was a bit dated but relatively clean however, the room was small with only one bedside table and no closet space (only a clothing rack in the main bed space which made it crowded with clothing hanging there). I was disappointed in the space compared to the price."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I loved my stay at Jacksonville Plaza. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Whenever I come back to Jacksonville, this will always be my hotel of choice."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Our expectations for this hotel were to find a cheap, clean place to rest our bodies before embarking on our cruise to the Bahamas. That's exactly what we got. It was cheap. It was clean. And with the exception of some loud exceptionally happy folks in the hallway, the paper thin walls left much to be desired. All we can... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Stay away at this hotel. Woke up with bites all over my body. Bed and pillow had blood stains.

Left over food found in the refrigerator... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,No great bells or whistles but a decent place to stay for the price. Clean. Fridge and microwave in the room but no iron Bed was comfortable. Walls are very thin. Breakfast was ok. Parking is close. Would go back.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"We have stayed here once before but this looks as if it will be our last stay. We arrived and were told by the non smiling front desk that we were too early for check in, unless we wished to pay a fee. We went for a drive to the river city mall to kill some time. When we returned... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"It was a business trip and stayed here at one night. The neighborhood is quiet and the offsite car rental is near the hotel. Comparing to the hotels within the airport, it is less and it was comfortable (at least I can sleep and take a hot shower)."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I have stayed here on two trips and will be booking a third. When all I need is a clean, safe room to stay in, this fit my needs nicely. I don't want to pay exorbitant rates when my only need is just somewhere to sleep and shower. The staff has been efficient and so friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for the business person who just needs the basics"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The motel is very basic, but clean and comfortable. The breakfast is mostly bread products. The wi-fi was unreliable. The motel is located among a number of more desirable and possibly less expensive properties clustered near the airport. Check those out before you decide on this one."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"DO NOT BOOK BASED ON TRIPADVISOR REVIEW RATING. That is the mistake I made. I booked this room based on a family of 3 listing on Priceline.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Room was not as portrayed. We have two small children we were traveling with and we could not bring ourselves to stay there. We went across the street the to the Mariott Courtyard and it was great.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Me and my fiance stayed here over the weekend jus to get home and find out our account was charged an extra 200 and they claim it was for smoking damages in a non smoking room but neither my fiance or I are smokers the customer service was horrible there was no evidence of us smoking in the room other than them claiming to smell smoke they charged our account without any evidence or warning and refuse to replace our funds so I will be taking it to small claims court
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"My husband and I drove from NY to Florida to go on a cruise. We did not get there until 1am. The lady behind the desk was VERY welcoming and friendly. The room was clean, the bed Was comfortable and the lady in the morning wished us a good trip. We were VERY happy the lady told us about the shuttle service !we will use this hotel in the future for all our cruises that we book ! Thank you!"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The pay at the hotel option does not work. They draft your card as soon as you check in to reserve room. The rooms are very small. They are ok for the price range. There is no pool, also there is no ironing board in the room. Customer service was ok, one was having a bad day I think. Would consider staying again for a quick get a way."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,The room or hotel itself is nothing like the pictures. It's a horrible rundown hotel. I'm so confused why they are even advertised on Expedia. The walls the smell was just horrible. This room/hotel should've been 20 max. It was so nasty. There was black mold on the torn wallpaper walls. The bed smelled. It was so uncomfortable. It didn't even feel clean. I didn't get under the covers. I sleep on my own travel blanket on top of their covers. I seriously hated it. I felt so tricked. Cigarettes marks on the counter. I felt like I was in some drug invested crapy building. I couldn't get my money back because of the no refund thing. I booked bc I missed my flight. Just horrid. I want my money back.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The check in we fast and easy. The room was Very clean and well maintained. The pillows were a bit soft, but just our opinion. Others may love them. But beyond that the place was like a 200.00 per night hotel at 70 less cost! Would stay anytime back in jacksonville"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"We chose this hotel because it got fairly good reviews on Expedia and we needed a place to stay near the airport for an early morning flight. The room was much smaller than anticipated the bathroom was tiny with bath towels that were thin and so undersized that they were only slightly larger than hand towels. The room was clean,however, and we slept ok. Our biggest complaint was that we did not get the wake-up call we asked for and the airport shuttle was more than 15 minutes late. The person at the front desk was dismissive, saying that she ordered the call and that was all she could do and that the shuttle driver would be there. Thank heavens we woke on our own and had given ourself a 30 minute cushion in addition to the two hours that we had planned for our international flight. We do not recommend this hotel. There are plenty of other options."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The staff was friendly and the bed comfortable, but this was the smallest room I've ever slept in (1 queen bed and only 2 ft on each side and about 3 1/2 feet between the end of the bed and the wall). Breakfast area was tiny with only a long counter against the wall with a few bar stools to... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I stayed here a full week while closing on a house. It is a great deal for the money. Close to the airport with a free shuttle provided.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Booked the hotel early July 7-16 I do my research months before we leave on a trip, according to it advertisement it was what I was looking for, great price, bottom floor, breakfast, free parking, easy on and off highway, the place was clean, staff very friendly from the time we checked in, our friends booked at the same time,...

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,After reading many reviews we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for one night. I was not expecting much and we were not really disappointed.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"In my pleasant experience at The Plaza Inn and Suites, I noted the cozy, even ergonomic, feel of the single queen bed room, which harmonized nicely with the conscientious and friendly employees at the front desk."

We tried the latter. BAD DECISION! 40 later, the food was frozen and not plesant. Will not make this mistake again."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Everything went perfect including the Stay Sail package for transportation to the cruise port and able to park our car included for six days. One suggestion would be to allow guests to keep the room until 2pm (even with an upcharge) we had to waste 2 1/2 hours driving around before going to the park ride lot for... More

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Location was good. Stayed as a pit stop. Had shopping center nearby. Not the nicest area but everyone stayed out of the others way for the most part. Hallways were hot. Said breakfast was included but they didnt have anything.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"friendly staff, clean room, overall decent hotel for the price. just don't expect anything fancy and you'll be just fine."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Great location for airport use! Parking available. Free shuttle.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I stayed here before and had a good stay. This time, my first room had an AC unit which wasn't functioning properly, so the room was about 80 degrees upon check-in. It didn't promptly cool down, so I requested a new room. The new room smelled like wet towels, but at least they were cool wet towels. I decided to make a go of it. The fan would not run steadily, cycling on and off the whole night. Unfortunately, the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door were talking loud/yelling until 2 AM, and I then continued to hear their TV through the wall until 3 AM. I had an early flight and got ZERO sleep. I've never had a night with less sleep. This hotel is great for its convenience to the airport. It's not so great if you actually want to sleep in comfort during your stay."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I checked out of an Extended Stay in a rush and didn't have many options. I would say I was thoroughly impressed seeing how this was the cheaper of hotels next to the airport. It isn't the best hotel I've ever stayed at but being last minute it is a 5 star compared to what I left. I don't ask for much, relative quietness, clean and a working AC. They made the marks in all departments on top of the bed being extremely comfortable. They do have shuttles to the airport. The breakfast options isn't huge, but you are right next to the outdoor mall with a Cracker Barrel if you are a breakfast person. Only downfall I say is the shower heads need to be upgraded. I would definitely stay here again!"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"When we arrived we walked into a room that smelled of cigarette smoke. My husband went down tot he front desk right away to let them know as we did not want to be charged with smoking in a room we just arrived in to. He came back up quickly and announced we had an upgrade to another room, I... More"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. It's an older hotel and there is a flowery perfume in the lobby and halls, but not within the room. The rooms were all marked as nonsmoking but there was a definite residual odor. For the money and convenience, I would stay here again. I only stayed one might to catch an early flight. There is a very light breakfast selection, but it's included I The rate and meets most dietS. I went to Cracker Barrel which was 3 minutes away."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This is excellent hotel for short time. The rooms are smaller but comfortable, also the breakfast is limited. I recommend this hotel."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Delayed flight good for sleeping one night but that's about it. The room was clean but dated.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Close to airport, shopping and restaurants, great value for the money!"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Wife and I rented a room for one night. The hotel was clean, staff friendly, and location very easy to get to.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,We stayed here two nights before leaving on a Carnival cruise. Online photos accurately depict the hotel. The room was comfortable and clean but nothing fancy.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Everything was as expected from the booking information, the staff who checked me in were very helpful and friendly. Room was small but fine for a single night stay. Room and bathroom were clean if a little worn. No issues with late check in and early check out. Only complaint was that when I arrived the room was incredibly warm and stuffy, and even cranking the fan didn't really alleviate the humidity in the room. Was not intolerable, and the bed was next to the air unit which helped."

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Reserved standard room for Thurs. Fri. for the hurricane. Called once we realized we had booked a standard queen (I was with my son) and was told that for 20 total, they would upgrade to a king with a sleeper sofa. Thanked them so much! Once there, was told it was an EXTRA 30 PER NIGHT...after my son explained the female manager basically called him a liar. Another manager came in and they finally only gouged us for 30 total, but for a double queen that had come available. The room wasn't too clean, so only after a couple of hours in the room, we decided to leave...they refunded Friday, but refused to refund for Thursday, even though it was only around 3 PM and they could have easily re-sold the room (and probably did). There are much better choices in the area."

I called them was told a shampoo dispenser was damaged,the room smelled of smoke and toilet paper stuck in exhaust fan. I explained to them neither of us smoke and if we did why would you block the exhaust fan, and the shampoo dispenser I didn't know.I told her I was coming back up there to be shown the room and what I'm paying 190.00 for she told me I could not see the room it had already been cleaned. So within an hour you found all this had the damage repaired, miraculously got the smoke smell out of the room wow.I told her I would dispute it and not pay she smugly giggled and said I already got the money basically take my word for it and pay up. I'm a white man my girlfriend is black I kind of felt she was talking and looking down on us looking for anything to get from us.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"hotel seemed to be very busy and the adjoining rooms were noisy and children running up and down the hallways. Bed was great, very upscale.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"We stayed in this hotel for one night. Its a shame the outside gives a far better appearance to the inside. The hotel was clean and tidy but the decor is somewhat dated - not sure what had been refurbished.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Over all the rooms were very nice and clean. The rooms looked like they did some up grades with the bathroom and flat screen on the wall. Yes the rooms are a lil on the small side but it suited my needs. Maybe the breakfast offered could be a little bit more choices. Overall I was satisfied.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,In need of renovations. Smelled of cigarettes and mildew.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,OK for just a one night stay but we won't return.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Room was extremely small. Bed small but comfy. Fridge and coffee maker. Bathroom a decent size. All clean. Continental breakfast included but very limited. Allowed an early check in which was great. Staff very friendly. Jacksonville it's self was a little poor and we wouldn't return.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"This hotel was lacking in basic hotel room features. There was no dresser,there was no closet, there were no kleenexes, there was no water pressure in the shower, there was no instruction book including no listing of TV channels and the sink took forever to drain. Also the breakfast was the most basic we have ever encountered with no protein whatsoever and only room for 4 people to sit and eat."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The hotel was very affordable for us as we simply needed a place to rest in between a long road trip.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Clean and comfortable hotel near to the airport. The breakfast was included and wasn't bad however I was ready to eat some waffles or pancake instead they offered pre packed Danish sweet bread, so we ran to Denny's (it is pretty near). If you like to sleep till late, my suggestion is to ask for a room situated in an upper floor. The first one is a little bit lousy after 8 a.m."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,This was the perfect hotel for us! We stayed here the night before we departed on a cruise. Very clean small and basic.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel as I was attending a military function. However, one day I left the hotel from 12:30 pm through to 1:30 am the following morning and returned to find that my room was not cleaned by housekeeping. I was lucky to have had a semi clean/used towel that I could reuse. Breakfast was very basic and to top it off, they ran out of creamer first in the morning! They need to keep a close tab on what needs to be replenished and get it done. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and accommodating. With all that was said, I would stay here again but only for 3 nights or less."

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Needed a quick place to stay to get to airport very early. From the moment I walked in I knew it was a mistake! The front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was terrible. It got worse. The elevators smelled like I don't know what. Thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of and used the stairs, as to avoid lobby and elevator.Even things that were nice, like the tile floor, was covered in a dirty all weather rug. I realize that not all hotel owners care about appearances, it was my error in judgement! The bedroom was okay, effort was put into decorating. I guess they are in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it!"

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,I'll admit was a bit concerned when I booked........However my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. Excellent staff and clean rooms.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Stayed one night following a flight into Jacksonville. Room was small which made running the a/c difficult as so close to the bed.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,Stayed a couple nights before our cruise. Hotel was very clean and rooms nice and comfortable. Was especially nice that we could keep our vehicle on the property while on the cruise and even had a shuttle to and from the cruise. Overall a good experience.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The motel room is small with a big space feel. This is because of lack of furniture. It does not have an armoire, a desk, a chest of drawers, or a closet and there is only a bed-side table and light on one side of the bed. It does have a table with a desk chair and a love seat and a shelf over the A/C unit to put suitcases. The rod for hanging clothes is very poorly placed in the approximate two feet between the bed and the wall, making it extremely awkward to get out of the bed on that side duck or hit your head. An iron and ironing board hang in the bathroom. The lavatory is in the bathroom and has little counter space. The room does have a refrigerator and microwave and a nice flat screen TV hanging on the wall. The bed was comfortable and the motel was reasonably priced for the area. They did charge an extra 5.00 plus tax for having a second vehicle. I was concerned about the proximity to the airport, but never heard a plane."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Nice place. Seemed like an upscale feel in the room. Some of the hotel felt outdated, but not distasteful Cars were parked on curbs. It was overall nice. I would definitely stay there again."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"If you ONLY want a room for ONE NIGHT, and fly out, then this is a good place. No Frills, nothing exciting to write home about. A queen bed and bath and TV. Now, the shuttle service to/from Jax Airport was very good and very prompt in getting us to the airport and picking us up and taking us back."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,We came for the Jaguars game. Good place to rest and get an early start.

Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"The hotel was nice the only thing wrong was the AC not cold enough, I would visit again"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Less than expected. Not impressed,..pictures online are deceiving. Wide angled lense shots to make room look bigger. It's a shoe box. Bigger than a salt box but not by much! If I wasn't careful I could knock my knees against the a/c unit. About a foot of space between a/c unit on one side and wall on other. Tiny. Front entrance and food area is just as misleading. My husband was fixing coffee and I saw a baby roach come out from sugar packet area and went under coffee machine. Don't expect a lot. It is truly NO FRILLS."
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Wifi barely worked, needs to do better with breakfast"
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,room was good. had to double up with a relative and I stayed on the open up sofa bed. very uncomfortable. sheet didn't fit the sofa bed and ended up on the bare mattress although a clean mattress. relative saw trash behind the headboard of the bed. shower nice. coffee in the morning good. staff very friendly and helpful
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,There were spots on the sheets as well as on the table. There were permanent marks in the tub.
Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,"Overall basic hotel, basic hotel experience. You get what you pay for. WiFi was good, Bed was good, and room was nice enough given the age. That said my rooms A/C unit seems to have a clogged drain or something as there was musty smell in my room. But the Bed and Pillows were clean and soft. I'll stay here again for a Jags game. Would like to point out, those not from the area, the water did smell funny, but not Hotels fault I only mention it for others I have seen reviews in the JAX area. It's the water of the area, unless you know a hotel with a filtration system, they will all smelly sulfury."

The hotel was easy access to the highway making it a quick trip to the local wineries. Only really needed the room for a place to sleep at night, and it suited that need just fine. Complimentary breakfast was a voucher for McDonalds, located next door, which was great! Another perk, my dog was able to stay for free. I didn't have to be put in a pet block of rooms, nor did the room smell of animals. I would definitely stay here again!"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"I love stay in Red Roof because the room are very nice and the member team Jessica (property 054) is very excellent professional (clean the rooms very good and attends to all our needs). The hotel is not luxury, but the members treat me very good."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Nice hotel. Only issue is the curtains. When you're on the bottom floor and the curtains are closed it's very dark without the lights on even during the day. There are curtains that have openings across the top so you would have privacy and still have some daylight in the room.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"By far the best staff of any hotel stay we've ever had. The front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions. Jessica gave us extra pillows and towels for our baby and kept the room spotless, she even turned the towels into animals!!. And Diane went out of her way to get us a comfy blanket for our baby when the temps dropped outside. Diane saw that i was a bit flustered with the crying baby gave me some very kind parenting tips As for the room...... :-( The microwave did not work properly, or at all at times. We spent the extra money for this room because we needed to refrigerate and warm up formula for the kid. The refrigerator froze up at night and made clunking noises, only to defrost in the morning, leaving a large puddle of water on the hardwood floors. The bed was obviously intended for people who are under 100 lbs, are bean poles, or like self torture, because its hard as a rock. Oh, and i hope you like dogs. You'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only hotel around that allows pets. Yes, big dogs in a Red Roof Inn. If we ever come back, it would be for the great employees and not the rooms."
Red Roof Inn Erie,We stayed on the second floor.Only drawback was that the floor by the window was really cold. It happens to be where the second floor over-hangs the first floor walk way. Poor insulation It was a great place to stay while visiting family.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Bathroom was kind of tight, had to step to side of toilet to close the door but otherwise was very nice"
Red Roof Inn Erie,I stayed here September 10th for one night. It is a clean place and strictly non smoking. I had my two dogs with me and there was no extra charge for this. The room was adequate. I stayed in room 128 in the back of building not facing highway. I do understand the complaint of noise from I 90 as... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,Great night. Friendly staff.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Great place, convenient location, good rates."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"I do a lot of traveling with my dogs and generally stay at Red Roof Inns. Not all Red Roof Inns are created equal, let me tell you. I learned that the hard way the first time I stayed at a Red Roof other than the Erie, PA location. At my Red Roof (Erie, PA), the rooms are always immaculate... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The room was clean, but seemed damp/mildewed, like no one had been in it for a while. There was a lot of traffic noise, but I should have known that since it was so close to the highway. The room was small, but adequate. Breakfast was a voucher for McDonald's which is right next door."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Quiet area. Clean room. Perfect for an overnight stay with a dog. Presque Isle State Park is a few miles away and hotdog place called Lucky Louie is a few minutes drive.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"From online photos we booked two nights here. Upon arrival, unhappy about the location...on a busy highway/intersection and McDonald's as the backyard neighbor. Still, we checked in as it was getting late. When we opened the door to our room we were met with such an overwhelming, disgusting smell that I immediately went to the lobby and cancelled. The front... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,The room was very comfortable but unfortunatly to close to Hwy 90 so we could hear the traffic constantly unfortunatly.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"stopped here overnight on the way to massachusetts. Hotel is right off of the highway, so a room in front does face the highway and can be a bit noisey. However the room was fine, and the fact that they accept pets is a plus."
Red Roof Inn Erie,As a bass fishing guide in Erie teamwhoopbassllc.com I stay here about 60-70 days a year. The staff is awesome here Lexie who works the front desk 10054 Erie Pa is simply one of the most genuine nice people you will ever meet. Place is clean and quiet plenty of room for a boat with electric
Red Roof Inn Erie,"I was stopping overnight because of hitting the road late that day, and I was happy to get a clean, comfortable, basic room with no hassles."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Clean room. The beds were okay but the highway noise kept me us awake most of the night. The bathroom was rather cramped and the shower head shot water out the back making a flood on the floor after the shower. Not a terrible hotel but I will try something else the next time I am in the area.
Red Roof Inn Erie,We stopped for one night on our travels through the area. The room was clean and comfortable. Our room faced the interstate and the traffic noise was loud but with the fan running in the room the traffic couldn't be heard. The air conditioning unit could use a good cleaning as my allergies (dust mold) flared up during our... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,convenient location right off the highway for the weary traveler.
Red Roof Inn Erie,As always we had a very good stay at the Red Roof Inn Erie. It is a great value. The free WiFi worked flawlessly. I watched a lot of Netflix shows without any problems. The rooms were very clean and up to date. The staff is very friendly especially Joyce who was at the front desk when we checked out... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Booked through Expedia, thinking it would be easier. I believe Expedia was helpful with getting a good price but that's about it. Very difficult to get a receipt with the red roof logo on to turn in for work. Clerk at front desk unwilling and unable to help. Rooms are ok, but noisy. I wouldn't recommend this place for women...

Red Roof Inn Erie,"We came because my husband had a meeting on Saturday, so we just needed a room for the evening. The room was clean, and the beds were really nice. The highway made the room a little noisy, but be were still able to get a good nights sleep:) Thank you. The price was moderate, considering there was no fridge or microwave, which would have been nice, especially a fridge:)"
Red Roof Inn Erie,Leslie at the front counter did a great job with explaining the property and the rewards program that red roof had to offer. I have stayed at several hotels recently and Leslie was one of the best. I would give her level of service a 10 out of 10.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Way to much money , could not sleep too close to highway"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Very nice hotel to stay in when traveling. We stayed for one night and had a king room, not room for kids to play around (but we don't have any so it was okay). Enjoyed the hard wood floors in our room, they were beautiful. The only thing I didn't care for was the comforter, it seemed very flat and not very soft. Other than that everything was wonderful"
Red Roof Inn Erie,We recently stopped here on our way for holiday. We had a small dog with us. The hotel was very nice and had a great pet area including doggie waste bags. There was even a shelter available for smoking. The hotel was clean and everything you could possibly need is nearby. I would stay here again.
Red Roof Inn Erie,Stayed here once in May 2016 and just got the standard 2 double beds and loved it. Purchased the 2 double beds deluxe to have a microwave and refrigerator. Thought the room would be a little bogger but it was smaller. The bathroom was so tiny compared to the regular room we stayed in a few months ago. Was disappointed in that. We also brought our dog who was with us during the day when we weren't at the hotel. Our room was never cleaned which was very disappointing as well. Our stay was not as great as the first time. Not sure if well stay here again.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The Red Roof room we were in was clean enough. However, the bed had a big slope in the middle on one side. It seemed like it was a sofa bed in a hotel room. I don't know if all of the rooms were like this, but it was a bit of a problem. Shower was fine. The room we... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Place looks a bit sketchy from outside but the room was great. Clean, comfortable and up to date. This place is a great deal if you need to be in Erie. One con, the fan in the bathroom was so loud."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"No nonsens stay at a very fair rate. Located next to the highway, gives a little noise, but nothing that you can't sleep from. Room is fine for a family of four. Found the beds on the hard side. Wifi was fast and stable. Free breakfast is a voucher to the next door McDonald's."
Red Roof Inn Erie,quick overnight stay.. staff was friendly and helpful. doors were kinda tough to work and one clerk had to come help us open it. note of interest.. this is NOT beach side.. the beach is about 10 minutes away. breakfast is a coupon to mcdonalds.. not bad.. different!
Red Roof Inn Erie,We have stayed at this hotel many times. We have never been dis appointed in the quality for the price. Excellant
Red Roof Inn Erie,"It was exactly as described, I got everything I expected to get. My room was clean and the lady in the lobby was extra nice and helpful with directions and recommending what beach to go to."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The desk clerk was exceptionally friendly at 2:30am to check us in and it was fast and easy. The room was very clean and we were happy to get 1st floor because we had a pet. We paid 10 extra for pet deposit, which was worth it to stay in such a nice hotel. We parked very close to our room which made unloading a breeze!"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Stayed one night. very good staff and good room. They serve McDonald's breakfast which I think is not ok but, if you like that then it be ok for you. The breakfast is one beverage and one entre, not enough for an adult. Overall, I will come back again if I have to."
Red Roof Inn Erie,It was a convenient locations and nice accommodations
Red Roof Inn Erie,The hotel was comfortable. They offer free breakfast voucher to be used at McDonalds which is in the shared parking lot. We were very pleased. We would stay there again.
Red Roof Inn Erie,Me and my husband stayed here for one night and was very pleased. Everything was very clean and tidy and the McDonald's free breakfast sandwich was a plus!
Red Roof Inn Erie,Wonderful desk worker assisted with a late check in. Hotel offers a great breakfast voucher deal with McDonalds
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We stopped off the highway just to sleep and continue our journey. Good clean room, and good shower."
Red Roof Inn Erie,I needed a place to stop for the night. The price was excellent - I was a little worried about the hotel because it was such a great value but I didn't have to worry. Rooms were clean and quiet (a little small but I only needed a bed for the night.) The bathroom was clean and well stocked. Easy... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We stayed here before and really liked it so we thought we would like to stay once again. We weren't disappointed!

Belinda, Megan, Joyce, and Bill went out of their way to ensure that... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The Erie, Pa. Red Roof is perfectly situated next to I-90- an excellent stop-over when travelling from say, NYC to Chicago, or vice versa. Comfortable, quiet rooms with wide screen tv featuring many channels, a handy, nearby McDonald's where you get a free breakfast the next morning- and best of all, knowledgeable and helpful staff to help you find places... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,We stayed here because it was only one available and it was ok but bathroom was extremely small. Also being hinted at about leaving housekeeping a tip tacky.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"All of the rooms face outside (typical Red Roof). THe room was clean enough. Shower was OK (it had a fold out seat for those that want to sit, and a handheld shower head). The bed, though, felt like a sofabed. The mattress was pretty thin and sloped in the middle on one side. It's right off the highway, and they'll give you a voucher for McDonald's next door for certain items. Good for those who are traveling."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Good that they didn't charge for a pet to stay. The stay included a voucher for McDonald's breakfast. The con is that the water pressure was very hard and the pillows were hard too.
Red Roof Inn Erie,Simply put I was very satisfied with my stay. We stayed in room 126 which was on the back side of the hotel so there was no noise from the highway. The location was good too as we were close to the wineries as well as everything Erie had to offer. The room was spotless and I am very particular... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,THE STAY WAS FINE. THE PILLOWS WERE VERY HARD SO IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO SLEEP.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Another visit to the Red Roof Inn and another interaction with a great employee. This time it was Dave who happened to be there on the late afternoon shift. He was easy going and a pleasure to interact with, answering all my questions about vending and things I may have needed in my room. Not to mention just nice company... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"great stay, However would liked to have seen Pitt. Pirates and Penguins play but cable channels were not available."
Red Roof Inn Erie,noisy due to room facing the highway exit
Red Roof Inn Erie,Just a quick note that I just recently stayed at this hotel on a quick weekend fishing trip. The hotel was very convenient to fishing. The rooms were very clean and the staff was great. Throw in a complimentary breakfast at the adjacent McDonalds -who could ask for more! I would definitely return.
Red Roof Inn Erie,The outside of the building doesn't give the room justice. The outside looks run down but I really liked the room we had which was a king. Bed could have been more comfortable. Breakfast is a voucher with McDonald's which is next door which I thought was cool. Staff was very polite and helpful.
Red Roof Inn Erie,we found that the service was very good and the room was clean and quiet. price was resonably priced. If ever in the area again and need a room Id stay again.we also stayed in a other red roof inn in Grove City ohio. we had the same experience there. seems to be a very good company that cares about...

Red Roof Inn Erie,Had one of my first excellent hotel experiences in this clean and comfy newly updated hotel. Stayed with a friend and my dog as this hotel is pet friendly. Access was easy and I was super happy to see wood floors and a clean space when arriving late. Recommend this great deal for a super affordable nice place to stay.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"While close to the highway, there is little sound insulation, so can hear traffic all night long. A voucher for MacDonalds is a poor excuse for free breakfast. No visible ice machines."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"A good value for the price. Room was very clean,comfortable and fresh smelling. Megan at the front desk was especially cordial and helpful. The motel is very close to and parallel to I90 so the room was a bit noisy into the late evening. I would recommend requesting a room on the other side of the motel."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Joyce and the other people at the front desk were so friendly and helpful. The room was spotless. It was very cozy and warm after a long day of touring Presque Isle State Park. The lady that checked us in made a great recommendation where to order pizza to have it delivered to our room. Everyone was very helpful.
Red Roof Inn Erie,We recently stayed at the red roof inn in Erie and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We traveled with our dog and was very impressed with their thoughtfulness to the pet area. The staff was very friendly and even brought extra towels to our room. The rooms are very clean.
Red Roof Inn Erie,I stay at this hotel several nights a week for business. It is always clean and a comfortable stay. Make sure you stop and see Megan at the front desk she will make sure you get a room that fits your needs and always has a smile on her face!
Red Roof Inn Erie,"I stay at this property at least once a year. We have always had a pleasant experience with the front desk staff and they've always accommodated our requests. Rooms are clean and spacious. I had left behind a camera battery and charger in our room, and they immediately found it for me and left it at the desk for pick... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Very noisy, so so wifi signal"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Good place to stay. Very clean, comfortable"
Red Roof Inn Erie,Great price for a updated clean modern room. Staff is very nice at the front desk. They allow pets with no fee!! Only complaint is highway noise but it wasnt awful.. All in all it was a great stay and i would stay again without question.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"My stay at the Red Roof Inn in Erie was very good. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and breakfast was free at McDonald's! I have stayed here in the past and will stay here again. This time I was in a room on the ground floor, in the past I have stayed on the second floor. The second... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,The second floor rooms are bigger than the first floor. And the front of the hotel on the highway is kinda loud. Otherwise comfortable and clean stunned its purpose well
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The staff is very friendly and helpful, moving me to a room I the back on request to be away from the noise of the road. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. What else do you really need, especially on a budget."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Don't be fooled by the name. This Red Roof Inn is the best one I've been to. It was recently updated with new everything. I stay in hotels 6 months a year for work and you get the most for your money here. Megan at the front desk makes it easy to check in and out problem free.
Red Roof Inn Erie,We recently were traveling through Erie on our way home from Florida and stopped at this hotel. The staff was very pleasant and the room was super clean. A nice touch was the free breakfast voucher for the nearby Mcdonalds. I would stay here again.
Red Roof Inn Erie,Nice updated room was small but big enough to be comfortable and cozy especially for 57.99 a night for the basic room which (mine at least) has a king bed definitely worth the price and splash lagoon is 2.5 miles just get on I90 (right next to motel and splash lagoon) Next time I come up here I am staying...

Red Roof Inn Erie,Rooms weren't ready at check in and had to take a down grade in rooms and got no refund .
Red Roof Inn Erie,Beds could've been more comfortable. They were hard to sleep on. Not soft and gentle.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Easy access from I90, clean, comfortable beds, good mini fridge, plenty of space. Stayed in a room with 2 double beds and was very pleased. Good value. Friendly employees. Breakfast voucher for the McDonald's next door was a nice plus. Would stay here again if going through the area."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"I don't understand the love for this hotel except it's inexpensive. Made the mistake of heeding all the 'excellent' reviews. The usual issues with this type of hotel...tiny room, no thermostat,cheap bedding, a sliver instead of a desk, internet lasted 10 minutes at a time, so weak you couldn't send an e-mail. Couldn't wait to get out in the morning. Only for folks on a tight budget, otherwise spend another 30-40 dollars and get a comfortable room."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Everything was as One would wish from check-in to check-out. Easy on/off to I-90, close enough (but not too close) to all Erie attractions."
Red Roof Inn Erie,The room was very clean and had all the necessities. We stayed at the back in the opposite side of the freeway and did not hear any noise. Great value compared to other hotels and pet friendly. Totally recommend.
Red Roof Inn Erie,Stayed at Erie Red Roof. I haven't been here in about 2 years. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. They offer free breakfast sandwich from McDonald's next door. Would definitely stay here again. Pet friendly.
Red Roof Inn Erie,The room facing I 90 very noisy with all the traffic. Also did not not like the charge for the safe in the room.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We were coming back from PA. The room was comfy and cozy but with room to move. A very nice place for the money, better than a room 30 more."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Stayed there enroute to the Cleveland Clinic. For the price there isn't a better deal out there in my opinion. Very clean (which was important) friendly and easy to get back onto the highway. We made the mistake of staying at another discount motel on our previous trip and it didn't compare. My family had mobility issues that the other... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,Yuck! Room was VERY small and did not match pictures. This is a MOTEL not a hotel or inn! Stay in a prison cell for the same level of comfort!
Red Roof Inn Erie,Flys were terrible......
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Stayed here last time we visited Erie, and decided to stay again for this trip. Good prices, even for being right in the middle of the summer season. They refresh the towels and make the beds everyday. We ended up having to get more towels everyday because there were four of us we also got a lot of extra toiletries,... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Check in/out was easy, booked and paid online. Enjoyed the free coffee and also the free breakfast from McD next door. I was only in the room to freshen up, shower and sleep."

Red Roof Inn Erie,Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful with area eateries. Provided maps and pointed out local area things to do. Great small stay!
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Perfectly located off I-90, a short jaunt to the casino. Unbeatable value and clean, comfortable room. Courteous front desk puts the customer first. Rooms are well-maintained and vouchers are supplied for next-day breakfast next door. Minor problem in morning as elec. breaker kicked out. Situation instantly remedied by mgmt. Highly recommend as John and Lexi put the customer first!"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Very nice place with a reasonable price. We were pleasantly surprised. It was clean and comfortable. Joyce was very helpful. Close to the interstate, easy off and on. McDonald's voucher for free breakfast"

Red Roof Inn Erie,1 night passing through
Red Roof Inn Erie,"This motel is conveniently located off the interstate and although there was lots of traffic, it was muffled enough to not be bothersome. Single level made this easy load-unload...

Red Roof Inn Erie,"Very easy to reach from the freeway, right next to a 24 hour McDonalds. Very clean well equipped rooms, free wifi, free breakfast, coffee, cable tv and tons of hot water to wash off the road dust. Team member Joyce saw that everything was perfect! Next time I am in Erie I will stay here."
Red Roof Inn Erie,This room was small and not very nice. Beds were doubles and not queens as advertised.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"At first when I checked in, I thought the nearby highway would be too loud, but I asked for a room around back and they were very accommodating.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"This was our first time in Erie Pa and at this hotel. We stayed for 6 nights and had no problems at all. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was quiet, peaceful and cleaned each day. I would recommend bringing softer pillows since the pillows for me personally was too hard. Other than that, very nice place to stay and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great place for a decent price."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"A quick background: we stopped overnight on our road trip from Vermont to Michigan. I had been in the car with a cranky man, four wild children between the ages of 12 and 7, and two shih tzus (one of whom was wearing a cone of shame following an eye injury). When we made our reservation, we had asked for... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,we have not stayed at a red roof in a long time. what a refreshing surprise! newly renovated with a trendy feel - very nicely done. great value
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The hotel is RIGHT next to highway (I-90). Heard traffic zooming by all night. The bed wasn't very comfortable, felt the springs. Bathroom was SO small, barely enough room to close the door while you were in it."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The front desk staff of Lexie Joyce were cheerful very helpful. The room is updated, clean functional. It is located right off Interstate 90, very convenient for travelers. They give you a voucher for breakfast the adjacent McDonald's."
Red Roof Inn Erie,Did n' t like breakfast at McDonald's. It was advertised free breakfast which it was for about 4. Not healthy or filling.
Red Roof Inn Erie,We have stayed at this hotel before but the pricing is now expensive for the value.They have done some up grades but on the second floor the smell of cigarette smoke is terrible and its non smoking it must be in the carpets. All lower units seem to be for pets very pet friendly. And very noise.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Room on the highway side of the building was small but nice. It was recently updated and was clean with a comfy King bed. Everything you might need from an iron and ironing board to a hairdryer was included. The only downfall was the loud traffic noise from I-90, but it did not keep us from sleeping.

Red Roof Inn Erie,Was just fine for place to sleep
Red Roof Inn Erie,I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for something cheap and just for one night to lay your head. My advice is to ask for one of the rooms on the side facing away from the interstate. We stayed in a room that was on the interstate side and it was noisy and difficult to sleep straight through the... More
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We checked into the hotel late in the evening. I appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the convenience of the McDonald's breakfast vouchers next door.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"Rooms were modern. They had easy access outlets to charge your devices. The wifi was great, my son could stream his Netflix. I had a second floor room which I recommend. I always prefer top floor when traveling better views and quieter! The shower worked great was hot and had good pressure. The bathtub was new. Front desk agent was... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,Great value and clean room. Bathroom is tiny but the large flat screen tv and spacious desk area make up for it. Comfy bed and pillows. Would definitely stay here again.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"This was our second stay at the Red Roof Inn in Erie. We stay here because of how affordable it is and how well taken care of it is. The staff is very friendly, and even though they don't offer a continental breakfast, they do give you a free McDonald's breakfast valchure! Is it the fanciest hotel in Erie No. But it's worth the price."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Booked the Red Roof Hotel and we're glad we did. From check in to check out, room was clean, pet friendly hotel, great location to everything you want to do. Joyce at front desk was very professional and very helpful! Maid was very nice too! Will stay there again, no doubt!"
Red Roof Inn Erie,Good location easy to find right off route 90. The only down fall is the road noise from route 90.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"great low cost hotel, location ok area not great"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The staff was welcoming, the night was clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay. Megan was particularly kind. This is motel on the way to other places. You can stop, spend the night and feel good. Our pets were welcome, and that made it even better."
Red Roof Inn Erie,This was my first time at a Red Roof Inn. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The free McDonald's breakfast was a major bonus. The only bad thing I can say is the beds are small and the pillows are hard.
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We got in really late to Erie, Pa and Elisha checked us in. She was very attentive and professional. She had also helped book our stay at last minute and got us the best deal possible. I hadn't stayed at the Red Roof Inn in years but rumor was it had been remodeled and it's located near the casino.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"Was impressed that I could make a reservation online. Room was a very nice size for 2 people. Double beds very clean. Altho, through the night it seemed like a door was being slammed every now and then, so I didn't get a great night sleep. And also just a heads up, the continental breakfast was the McDonald's next... More"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"This Inn meets expectations of Red Roofs. No breakfast, so they give McDonalds coupons (adjacent to the Inn) for a limited breakfast and beverage selection. The Inn is not a budget motel by comparison to others in the area."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Because of the room being so tiny, I won't stay there anymore, however, the staff was really great, and the room was clean"
Red Roof Inn Erie,"Clean hotel but sits right on the highway. Yes, RIGHT ON the Highway. They did give us a ticket to eat at McDonald which is right next door for our breakfast. Not bad for the price, but bring ear plugs."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"We were traveling with dogs, no extra fess for the dogs, beside the highway but you didn't notice any noise inside the room. No breakfast but we received a McDonald's Voucher instead. MacDonald's was on the way to the highway. Two miles down the road were a number of restaurants and a stores. Room was clean, and comfortable. good value."
Red Roof Inn Erie,"The only small maintenance issue was some rusty discoloration on the steps in the stairwell by the lobby leading up to the second floor. Otherwise, the hotel was in great shape and the room was very comfortable. I was happy with the refrigerator, microwave, workspace, and cleanliness. The check in and check out process were great with friendly, helpful employees."
Red Roof Inn Erie,very clean and comfortable
Red Roof Inn Erie,Room was clean and comfortable but the noise coming off of the Thruway was horrible. Couldn't fall asleep because of the noise.

Red Roof Inn Erie,"This was the nicest Red Roof Inn I've ever stayed in. It's conveniently located near the highway and is close to local attractions (Millcreek Mall, the casino, Presque Isle, Erie Zoo, etc.). The highway traffic is loud, but didn't keep me awake at night and the hallway and room had a musty smell. I enjoyed having a one-serve coffee maker in the room, but I would've liked a small microwave."

After the problem with the toilet, I would've thought we deserved a little discount on the room, but that was not offered to us."

Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,"The room was really noisy. I clearly heard the surrounding rooms, talking on the street (I was on the 7th floor), and the hallway noise and elevator. The bed was rock hard too. It looks nice by day, but most people don't use a hotel room during the day."
Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,"Room was very clean, well maintained. Beds were fairly comfortable (just not like home...never are!)

Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,Stayed this several times over the years. Last visited we left behind a sweater and the staff were quite non-responsive.

Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,We happened to find a Groupon for a stay at Hotel Deca when we needed just one night in Seattle (and were staying at our son's house the other night of our visit). We require just a few things in a hotel: cleanliness a reasonably comfortable bed free wi-fi and polite staff. Deca delivered all those things and more. We... More
Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,"I am normally very forgiving of hotels (I travel all over the world frequently) and am rarely moved to write negative reviews. However, I was really disappointed with Hotel Deca last week. The hotel has a local monopoly and exploits that to the maximum. From the check-in/check-out to the restaurant, the service at best was inept/inefficient and at worst, downright... More"

Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,"My wife, 20-something daughter and I stayed at the Deca for a 4-day visit to Seattle. It was less expensive than comparable downtown hotels, the savings way more than offsetting the 10 or 12 Uber fare to downtown. Besides, we wanted to see more Seattle neighbourhoods than just downtown, so planned our days to start or end nearer the hotel.... More"
Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,A very convenient hotel ten minutes or less from the University of Washington campus and 30 minutes or so from downtown (depending on traffic).

Hotel Deca - A Noble House Hotel,"After many reviews and a special offer through a work website, I decided this is where wed stay for our upcoming 3 nights in Seattle. Honestly, I would probably stay here again. There were some good high points and some low points. The hotel does feel a little dated, but has a neat old world charm that makes you feel... More"

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"After getting into our room, I found that I did not get what I had booked through Expedia over a month ago. I called the desk and he said they had nothing else available that night. How do you not have the room that someone booked over a month ago that was non refundable The carpet was wet so had to put towels down and the comment for that was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms. By the next day, we were not changing at that point. Never will stay again!!!"

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Very clean hotel! Great location! Walking distance to everything . The beds were really comfortable. Yummy full breakfast! Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Excellent wifi. The indoor pool and hot tub was very nice!
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Hotel was nice except the pool was small and the hot tub was out of service.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,It was a wonderful room with a balcony to watch the morning sun rise out of the ocean or see the activities on the beach from the comfort of your room. It had easy access to the beach. It was always clean and nice. Breakfast was very good and included with the cost of the room.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,I was very impressed with this hotel. The staff was AMAZING! They were always professional and polite. The view of the ocean from the room was priceless!
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Our stay was great!!!

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The hotel was great! The suite was well designed, the pool and hot tub fun, the breakfast had good choices, the popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon and the pancakes at night delighted my young granddaughter. The staff was especially friendly and helpful!! We will definitely return."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Very courteous staff, clean room, comfortable bed. Quiet, great view of the water. Breakfast was good. All in all a wonderful stay and great experience. Thank you!"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Overall, the staff leave a very good impression of friendliness and the breakfast was quite good for its type. The room was clean and well-appointed and all rooms have balconies overlooking the ocean with the hallway providing panoramic windows to look out to the west. The only real distraction was that the construction type of the building and the heaviness of the doors and spring action needed to shut the doors meant that you heard every door on the floor close very clearly and you could hear noises from the room next door. It doesn't seem like much except that everything else is quite silent. It is why I only give the comfort level a 3 out of 5 as it is hard to get comfortable when you hear doors slamming shut all of the time."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"I use the staircase instead of the elevator most of the time. Surprised to see it in need of a cleaning. Spills on the concrete mad for a sticky floor and bottom floor had been used for storage. (Shopvac, bike, bags of something). The sliding door to the balcany was in need of track clean or repair. My wife couldnt even get the door closed. Had to use your fingers to pull it shut when out on the balcany and it was a struggle. Breakfast was good. There was plenty of seating in the morning. Food was plentiful and the staff working was friendly."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Great service. Everyone was extremely friendly. The only 2 things I didn't like was the parking and the indoor pool.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The hotel was nice enough. We have 2 small kids, and they didn't have much room to move around without bumping into things. We were outside most of the time, so it's not a big deal. We asked for a crib on several different occasions and didn't get one. Luckily we brought our own - so, also, not a big deal."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Stayed in this hotel for four nights recently. Great location - close to everything and right on the boardwalk. No complaints.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,The air conditioner in my room wasn't working properly. It was a hot and uncomfortable stay for all the money I spent. I'll never stay again. The fact that it was oceanfront.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"We were there for a sporting event. Only a mile from Convention center. Oceanfront room. Hot breakfast every morning. Only negative is that the indoor pool is VERY small and the hot tub was ice cold, it was not working and had same cold water as the pool."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Great stay. Parking was included, there re a few lots around the property. Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Rooms too expensive, hard to find parking space. Park 2 blocks from hotel. i don't really recommend to friends, pool is very small."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Even when things go a little wrong, the customer service of all of the staff make the biggest difference! Washing machine wasn't working - they got someone to fix it immediately. Missed cleaning our room one day (partly our fault...we were off to a late start!)...multiple apologies and they came as soon as we left the following day. Lots of freebies at this hotel, letting you know your patronage is valued AND their desire for you to have a great vacation! Cookies, popcorn, lemonade in the afternoon, and pancakes from 6 - 10 at night! Breakfast was amazing - lots of options and excellent! Would come here again in a heartbeat during our next visit."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,It wasn't bad. The location was great and the bed was comfortable. We had to use the pullout bed.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The hotel was a huge disappointment. There was a wad of hair on the floor/bathtub that stayed there for four days there was NO in-room coffee for six days (kept saying it was on order) A/C was leaking: had a blower in our room for four days TV constantly pixeled out due to the terrible supplier of service three days of not replacing used hygiene products. This hotel ruined our entire stay in Virginia Beach, so needless to say we will not return."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"I was in Virginia beach for a business trip and my company booked the hotel for me.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"We stayed here for the Carrie Underwood concert in Hampton, VA and we were pretty disappointed by this hotel. When we first walked into our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way. We had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room. The pictures for this hotel look much nicer than the actual rooms, our bathroom had very little space and the countertop near the sink had a large crack. We had to kill a couple of bugs during our two night stay and the overpriced Coke machine outside of the room had expired drinks. The last morning of our trip the toilet stopped flushing and that was kind of the last straw with this hotel, we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here. We did make management at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a free Coke and a membership to their rewards program with around 10,000 points to make up for the issues... the points do not even come close to giving us any rewards through their program. Disappointing stay overall."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Pleasantly surprised when we walked in to see two separate rooms (living room with balcony on oceanfront/boardwalk and bedroom with overlook of the front of the hotel). Very elegant, comfortable, and spacious. The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. The room had a make-shift kitchenette without glassware or silverware, but behold...a Keurig!! Extra towels and toiletries were available which helped since we were beachbound and poolside numerous times during our stay. We can't wait to visit again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,My friends and I stayed four nights at this hotel. Best decision! Everyone was very friendly and the hotel was very clean. The view off the balcony was beautiful. We sa dolphins swimming EVERY morning. They had pancakes available at night which was a fun way to top off the night for us. A little dessert. Great place to stay!
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Check in was at 4. Didn't give us our room until 4:45. Not good. Otherwise was nice place. Not a high end place but nice enough
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Hotel staff was super friendly!!

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Just like the other reviews: parking isn't convenient, sliding bslcony door almost impossible to open and close from the outside, and cleaning was spotty. One day the housekeeping didn't arrive until 5:00 p.m., which is hard to plan around as far as showering and getting ready for dinner out. Breakfast was plentiful, with many options. The hot food choices were delicious. Reserved a suite and the extra space came in handy. The location is great, but the festival 3 blocks down could be heard until midnight or later. Thankfully the suite bedroom is on the parking side so the sound did not penetrate the bedroom."

The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but the room was overall clean. The beds were definitely comfortable. The door that separates the two rooms were unlocked unfortunately. The people in the other room opened our door and of course we were not expecting someone walking through that door since it is normally locked. I did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got to the room. I just assumed it was always locked. Lesson learned for sure.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"First--Paid about twice the normal rate to stay on Ocean Front during Neptune Festival, but bad weather caused city to cancel the Ocean Front activities and bands. Asked about a rate reduction given the basis of the higher than normal room rate was no longer scheduled and no one could do. Didn't seem fair to pay twice the rate given the circumstance. Second-- Tub/shower leaked onto floor whenever used-- tub spout was loose off tiled wall and water was leaking in behind. Third-- Booked through Booking.Com and was not eligible for Holiday Inn reward points. Location."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The hotel is right on the beach with good ocean view. The combined parking facilities (total 3) were good enough and never had problem finding one spot for my car. The free breakfast was good with decent choice of food. When we entered we were happy with the room cleanliness. Entered the toilet and we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere. Had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of smell, good thing was, atleast it worked. For the mattresses, one queen mattress was good enough to hold 2 adults without sagging. Other mattress was terrible seems like the coil was damaged. As soon as I sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches. We avoided to use that mattress to avert back pain. We let our 8 yr old sleep in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort. Overall for the price of the room I was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Overall - we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The only reason I am rating it a 4 is because the feel is a bit dated and worn. But it is a beach hotel- so I expect a bit of wear and tear. That being said - all the rooms open to the ocean with balconies. It was wonderful sleeping... More
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Only thing we didn't like was how the eggs were prepared the second day of our stay. They were scrambled, dry and had too much pepper on them. We loved the location (perfect), view (excellent), room (very nice), friendly staff, breakfast (pancakes, cheese omelet) and parking pass. Also, we were walking distance to everything (shops restaurants activitiesand the boardwalk)."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Nothing
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"I would say they have to monitor parking lot, lots of rude people blocking people in at the parking lot's. Also breakfast was plenty but, The meat was the same all week. I wish they would have rotated bacon and sausage . loved everything else there was so much food and they serve coffee all day and night. They also served popcorn, cookies and lemon-aide. Free pancakes from 6 pm- 10pm. you could survive there for a week on all the food."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,My family and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We stayed for 4 nights in August 2015. We enjoyed waking up to an Ocean Front view.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,check in a disaster. I requested a early check in and I go there at 11AM. The lady I talked with at the front desk had no personality at all. I told her I had reservations with a early check in time and when she first open her mouth I knew this was not going to go well. She told me it would be around 2PM before I could get a room so I ask her would she put me on the top of the list for the first room because i had been traveling all day. the no personality come out again in her and I know we would not get a room early. when I stepped out to the car I told my wife we could forget a early check in and I was right. We set in the lobby in plain view of the front desk watching guest being checked in. Finally after sitting there from 11AM to 1:45PM I stepped back up to the desk and ask why I'm sitting here for about three hours watching people being checked in. she told me it was the type room i was getting. There was another lady there this time listening to what i was saying that i had been sitting here for about three hours. I left and went set back down at 1:55PM. 1:58PM they called me back up there and gave me the keys. She was making me wait to show me she was in control and she cared less about the guest. I have stayed at about 95 of the motels up and down Virginia Beach through out the last ten years this includes the other Holiday Inn with no problems but the check in at the Holiday Inn Express ruin my whole trip. This was my first stay and the last...... So with that being said I give them a zero!!! the room was clean and house keeping was great to work with.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"No complaints after 3 stays. Third year we have stayed at this location over the New Year's holiday week (12/26 thru 12/31). Staff helpful, friendly and always available. Breakfast was fantastic daily. Changed queen room to a Suite this year and it's definitely the way to stay! Look forward to future visits."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Breakfast food was okay. The eggs were cold both days. You should have toppings for your yogurt. Everything was great. I didn't have any complaints and would recommend your hotel to anyone.

My first impression of the hotel was from the... More"

A group of very loud, drunk people started bbq-ing... More"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The price in comparison to some of the more upscale hotels a couple blocks up the boardwalk is a little high. We'd never been to VA Beach and realized the location of this hotel, while very close walking distance to a lot of stores, was not exactly where we had wanted to be. There seemed to be much nicer hotels and stores about 4-5 blocks up in the 30th Street area but that area is still easy to walk to. The rooms could definitely use an upgrade to decor - they're a bit tacky and older looking however, still clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. Now if you ask my husband, his only concern of the trip would be Nowhere here sells funnel cake! which we thought was very strange, but of course has nothing to do with the hotel itself. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly. The proximity and access to the beach area was great and loved the complimentary breakfast (although I would recommend checking milk labels, I accidentally drank one that was no longer good and spent that day feeling terrible). We did test out the indoor pool/hot tub, but it seemed that a lot of parents/kids had a great time there. Overall, great location for easy beach access and a very family-friendly hotel."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"Hot tub was broken, pool never vacuumed. No one cleaned the gym our entire stay. The glass doors were very dirty and disgusting leading to beach area. Sliding door in room very hard to open and close. Breakfast buffet was good. Beautiful view and great location. Room was clean."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The whole place needed a bit more cleaning, the shower curtain was torn and there did not seem to be enough staff to keep up with the guests. the view was great, the breakfast hot, and the location was good.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,Rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. Guests were a problem. There was a high school band completion so there were kids everywhere. There were teachers there but you could here the kids most of the night.

I returned at 4pm and there was another receptionist who told me he didn't know what happened. We finally checked in and found both locks on our patio door were broken, the drain cover in the bathroom was broke and the cover on the smoke detector broke when the door was closed. Housekeeping didn't come till 2pm the next day to bring fresh towels. We were not satisfied with our stay and expected so much more for the price we paid to stay at this Holiday Inn."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,The HVAC unit in my house went out. Thank goodness HI was able to come to my rescue. They went out of their way to help with the two rooms I needed to include a crib for the baby. The staff and facilities eased the pain of being displaced.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The staff was pretty rude. I arrived early, as they told me I could and to my surprise the room was filthy and they didn't replace any of the previous sheets, toiletries, etc. it was absolutely horrible. Especially for the price I paid. The location was awesome, right on the beach. Since it was a rainy day, it was extra gloomy because it's on the beach."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, but the poor mattress really messed my sleep. The housekeeping accidentally put my beach towel in their laundry and it didn't come back, neither did the front desk offer to reimburse me or get me another towel.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"This is not the hotels fault but I'm not sure the management can do anything, but I wanted to bring attention to it. There were several homeless men on the benches on the boardwalk, in front of the hotel. They didn't bother anyone except one night we were walking by and one of them got sick and just leaned his head over and vomited next to the bench. It was quite disgusting, we had just eaten dinner. I have an aversion to seeing and hearing people getting sick and this was quite gross. The complimentary breakfast, popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon and the pancakes in the evening. Staff was very friendly. Loved that the hotel was oceanfront."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Va Beach Oceanfront,"We stayed for one night, and everything was great. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, and listening to the waves from the balcony was a relaxing experience. The included breakfast was fine, although there was no onsite restaurant for lunch or dinner. That being said, there were a few dining options within walking distance. Kids - and adults - will probably like the nearby pizza options (they deliver to your room). The seafood establishments were a bit pricey, as to be expected near the beach, and some options were better than others. Generally, thumbs up, and worth the trip."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"Very nice hotel on the Saginaw River . We had a JR suite which was very nice and big , but the view was of the east side dwntwn and the back of some buildings . You probably can't get a river view w/ hotels.com . I certainly would like go back maybe during the summer time and enjoy the surrounding area and beaches of Lake Huron ."

Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,Good ANd comfortable!
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,Very loud AC unit
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"One problem, the loud drunks running up and down the hall with their screaming and partying, all night long into the morning. The staff responded appropriately , but it makes for a rough next business day not sleeping .They should consider putting guests that aren't related to a wedding party block of rooms elsewhere , on a different floor."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN STAFF. If you need to book a block of rooms....don't go here! Their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the rooms are actually available or not in that block. Had to scramble to get wedding guests hotel rooms else where because the staff at Doubletree told them that our block was full. Week before the wedding, I got a call from hotel saying I still had rooms available and if we were going to fill them or not. Very disappointed in their serv...view moreice. Stayed there over the night of our wedding...I will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the hassel.view less"
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,The room was beautiful and very inviting. Price was great and had a wonderful view of the water from the room. It was a suite and perfect for relaxing whether business or vacation! Would recommend this Hilton in Bay City as a preferred place to kick back.
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable. And, you just can't beat the location, beautiful sunsets looking out across the river. Clean, safe adjacent park and downtown area for dining or an evening stroll."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"A very nice hotel, good service, warm chocolate chip, walnut cookies at check-in -- though I wish they had a walnut-free version. My one dislike is how much noise the heating system made every time it turned on. It somewhat interfered with my sleep."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"Very clean, fresh, friendly, accommodating, comfortable. The pool and fitness center were very pleasant, clean and good equipment. It is located along the river front. It is an easy walk to the downtown restaurants and shops."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,Nice hotel and decent location for activities. Price to high. Quality of room does not match the triple normal prices they were charging this weekend. Seems to be common practice to change extremely high prices during a local festival. But not right.
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,Ice machine didn't work i had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't get cold wasnt very happy i spent that much money on the room and had to buy a cooler and ice!
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,Fine except we could not get breakfast due to prep for a thanksgiving buffet.
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"The Double Tree Hotel in Bay City is always our first choice hotel when we are visiting in the tri-county area. The reservations are easily mad online. The staff are friendly and helpful as we get settled in, during our stay, and checking out. The rooms are pleasant, clean and quiet. The food and service in the main restaurant superior. The ambiance and service in the lounge, fantastic. It is a joy to stay at your hotel every time."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"I have stayed at this DoubleTree a number of times. It is ALWAYS clean, and the employees are ALWAYS friendly and helpful. This includes those at the front desk as well as the restaurant and louge. The location is easily within walking distance (about two blocks or less) to the downtown area. I will definitely return here!"
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"We enjoyed our stay here very much. The bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable and the breakfast was good. (If you are going to eat there be sure to grab a 5 off coupon in the lobby.) Good restaurants are within walking distance as well. However, the air conditioner was very loud. I ended up stacking all the extra pillow in front of it to reduce the noise."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"Perfect stay! The restaurant was amazing, food awesome."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"Great place, great stay!"
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"Nice hotel but pricey for the area given it doesn't include breakfast. We usually stay at hotels with breakfast included because of the convenience with small children. Although Doubletree has a restaurant, breakfast is not cost effective with small children."
Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"When we arrived pool was closed Due to an ACCIDENT , that makes me wonder-- we never used the pool after that. The brochurers for Sept. had already been thrown away and Oct- Dec. in its place. So we had no idea what there was to do in this town. I couldn't get connected to Internet wirelessly nor through cable. So I couldn't look things up and I could not send my work via internet at all during my stay. The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels. This was very clean, but other than that it was a huge waste of our money. For the price of these rooms I expected a great deal more. A balcony for sure when your paying for a river view. We found the HIDDEN microwave and mini fridge on the DAY WE WERE LEAVING, that would have been nice to use during our stay. JUST A WASTE of money."

Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,We traveled to Bay City for the first time for a wedding of an employee. Of course we reserved a room from the block reserved for the wedding guests.

Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"The hotel staff went above and beyond to make my stay very enjoyable....for a busy meeting professional like myself, it is so importat to be able to be flexible and adapt when necessary.

Doubletree By Hilton Hotel Bay City - Riverfront,"They were very welcoming. They had plenty of free, convenient parking even though it was in downtown Bay City--right on the river. The facilities were great. The lobbies were nice and they had a lot of tourist information if you're looking for things to do in the area. In my room, they had a beautiful local magazine listing activities in the area as well as vignettes of local restaurants--a great magazine. They also gave me a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with walnuts at check-in. Nice touch.The people at the front desk were very helpful. The breakfast buffet was nice my room was very nice.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Great breakfast buffet w/ hot eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, etc . Staff very friendly helpful in booking tours, providing maps and giving directions. Location just 4 blocks from Bourbon St and 3 blocks from Hop on Hop off double decker bus which was a great bargain 39 good for 3 days. Only minus was the street is all torn up as they are putting in rails for a new street car line. Also the rooms could use a little spiffing up."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. All of their suggestions were very good.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Its location, N. Rampart, puts it at the border of the French Quarter. The location is a short stroll way from the partying of Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Could use some updating: broken railings (including on 3rd floor which could be dangerous), mold in shower area, poor lighting. Staff was very polite and helpful."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Located conveniently in the French Quarter, you are just a hop, skip and a jump away from the best time of your life. A quaint little hotel with a private courtyard and pool, it has a serene environment inside without removing you from the hustle and bustle outside. The rooms were large and very clean, the staff is very accommodating,... More"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The rooms were a bit small but not an issue for me. The breakfast was pretty yummy and it was very convenient to have a bar at the hotel (something to do while my friends finished some work). I will definitely recommend this place!
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Spent two nights with my adult daughter and could not be more pleased. The room appeared to be recently renovated and finishes were good. Lovely full size tiled shower (no bath). Our room was on the U-shaped surround of the courtyard, which was lovely and full of greenery, a fountain, pool and several shaded tables.The breakfast was disappointing with low-end... More"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Coolest hotel
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We were in town for my son to interview at LSU Dental School. The hotel was great. The breakfast was terrific! The staff was excellent, friendly, courteous. The grounds were beautiful. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay another day."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Kids loved the pool, great customer service, needs some minor things but overall I would return."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,There were several issues with our room but they were rectified in a timely manner.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Overall nice Hotel, nice area. Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Like a previous review, we found parking to be very tight and were thankful for an employee who parked our car. There was a slight room mix-up but we were comped for the parking because of it- thanks. Our room door stuck a lot but we managed. We had to leave too early for breakfast so I can't comment on it. Being an old hotel, the room was quite small but the bathroom had been well renovated. I also wish the bar would have been open the night we were there."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We had a street view. There is construction going on extending the streetcar. Not the hotels fault, but they do start at 7am. If you plan on sleeping in past 7 do not get the street view. Also we had a Sysco delivery truck pull up out front at 5:00 am on our last day, the trucks engine ran until 6:15am then the driver got out his hand truck and loaded the hand truck, scanning every box, making a very loud noise. There should be a back or side entrance for deliveries, not in the front directly under the windows of the patrons paying a lot of money for the stay. It was very rude, and for that reason I would not recommend staying at this location."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The location is very nice-just 3 blocks from Bourbon Street. There is a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel but didn't affect our stay. Staff was very nice and the breakfast had a nice variety. The elevator is extremely small-my husband and i with 3 suitcases filled it up. The bathroom layout was very odd. A large bathroom but the sink was outside the bathroom. There was only 1 small light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark. The shower had NO water pressure at all. The pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks. Did not get a good night sleep. Overall wouldn't stay again unless there wasn't another choice.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Basic, updated 1960s-70s facility, quiet, walking distance to the Quarter and Treme, across from Louis Armstrong Park, close to Basin Street Station, clean, nice people, ought to be very very busy once the Rampart Street trolley line is open this year."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We stayed in room 220. It was 3 of us, the room was a nice size. Nothing to crazy, clean and well kept. The staff was super cool! We honeay do believe that our room had a spirit in it, I personally didn't get messed w... I might of but I had way too much hydration in me to notice anything. One of the girls swears she was watched the whole night and didn't sleep but 20 mins in the middle of the day, the other girl w us had her feet played with. No joke! Nothing scary happened but isent this what Nola is all about We didn't mind out friendly ghost In our room. Over all we had a great stay and I would definitely be back!"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We stayed for my husband's birthday. It was a convenient walk to the French Quarter and the staff was more than welcoming and always willing to help. Breakfast is free and quite satisfying. The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable. We had a courtyard view of the pool and it was very nice. Although it was a bit more pricey, it was worth the money."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The room was either really cold or hot. The bathroom wasn't very clean. Bed was comfy. Continental breakfast was better than average. There were more options than usual by they weren't that tasty. They were going through a bit of construction that kept it noisy outside our room.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"5 minute walk to Bourbon St. great breakfast, self parking in the heart of the French Quarter."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Friendly staff. Key card issues on 2 of the 4 days but quickly resolved. Great location. Parking on site but very small spaces. Kids enjoyed the pool and free breakfast.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We stayed over night on this hotel and can say nothing bad about it. Yes there is construction going on outside the front of it. However, we stayed in the back of the hotel and noise wasn't an issue. The hotel is on a great location. It is located on the edge of the French Quarter - close enough to... More"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Great location to investigate the French Quarter but far enough away to get out of the noise of Bourbon St
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"This hotel is on the northeast corner of the French Quarter, approx. 3 blocks from Bourbon Street and a couple blocks from Louis Armstrong Park. We booked it because the price was reasonable and we have been pleased with other Best Western Plus locations. Once again we were satisfied. Since this is an older building, the rooms were a little... More"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Stayed here one week before Madrigal. The place is very appropriate for the area. Nice court yard. Rooms are nice a bit small. It is just 3 block from Bourbon Street and all the other great things that the French Quarter has to offer.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,A quaint little motel with loads of character. Great location-can walk anywhere in French Quarter or downtown at a pinch.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,We stayed here for the start of Mardi Gras and the location was just perfect. Efficient check-in by staff but had to wait for room as it was not ready. This was no problem for us at all. We had just missed breakfast but tea and coffee was on tap all day at no extra cost which was a nice... More
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Went for Mardi Gras with friends
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Older hotel, walking distance to everything in the French Quarter. Room was very clean, but had a musty smell - normal for such an old building. Charming courtyard. Really tight self parking - and expect to pay 30 for it, with in/out privileges - but ultimately worth it because finding parking is a nightmare in this area. Good breakfast - scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, cereal, granola yogurt. Check out at noon is a plus. Safe and quiet area, close to everything. I would stay here again for a French Quarter visit."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. We paid for parking and there was none. This is not a safe place to bring kids. We disliked it so much, we ended up not staying. Staff was rude."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Just came back from a weekend getaway with the neighbors and can't say enough nice things about your hotel! From the check-in to check-out everything was wonderful! There was construction out front but our stay couldn't be better, your continental breakfast was great and the breakfast attendant Kim did an awesome job! Will definitely come back, we were with a...

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Fantastic location, but noise from the hall was very audible"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"They allowed us to check in early, a real plus on a rainy day, Staff was friendly and helpful."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The reason for the mediocre cleanliness rating was the carpet. It was fairly new but seemed damp and had a gummy feel to it. Glad that I brought flip flops to use in the room. All of the property staff that I encountered were super friendly and helpful. They made you feel like they appreciated you being a guest at their facility.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Old hotel but clean and in a great location. Close to everything NOLA has to offer yet in a quiet location.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"I like being n walking distance to d french Quater, I liked it."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"This is our third visit to the Best Western Landmark Hotel and it is still, in my opinion the best place to stay while visiting the French Quarter.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,A good stay close to everything in the French quarter.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,It was I really nice stay. Staff was fantastic!
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"This location in NOLA is excellent, safe, clean with great staff and services. Close enough to everything in the French Quarters and far enough away that you can get a good night's rest. NOLA tours will pick up and drop you off at the hotel."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Nice room with all the amenities. Just blocks from the Quarter. St. Ann street is the best option for a walk to the Quarter and is well lit at night. A hot, continental breakfast was available. All family members found something they liked. Courtyard was beautiful and very peaceful to soak up the atmosphere of New Orleans."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"A find, located near the periphery of the Quarter, away from the hustle bustle yet walkable. I will stay here again and highly recommend the property to others. The staff is beyond courteous, they go out of their way to make your stay pleasurable."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,I have stayed multiple times because of the free breakfast (saves quite a bit of money) and the affordable rates. Book early and you can save a ton of money. I saved over 400 dollars booking 6 months out.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Hotel was nice. But had a problem with the plumbing. Sink didn't drain and when it did the water would come up in the shower. But besides that people were very nice and helpful.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The parking was horrible.Not enough places for guests to park was very limited.The parking was so tight that you could almost hit the poles near you.Terrible.The breakfast was good.
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Nice staff, very helpful and friendly. Robert at the front desk was great in directing us to the right places and keeping us on track. The rooms are clean well maintained and quiet. The courtyard is wonderful . All in all a nice place and only 5 short block from bourbon st."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Despite checking in late, the staff that greeted us were absolutely wonderful. We had a fantastic trip and it was so amazing not having to worry about where we were staying. The location was perfect for going out, and right around the corner was an amazing restaurant called Eat New Orleans. The room was clean and just a few short blocks from Bourbon and Royale streets. Fantastic time, can't wait to come again!"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Familytrip of 3 days, had a really good time! The hotel is very nice, right there in French Quarter, but not at the noisy main street. Only 3 blocks to walk and you are in the middle of it all! Breakfast was very nice too! Hotel has charming feeling, and staff was vey friendly. The only issue I had, was the fan/AC noise, from unit of the room. As I was sleeping right next to it, and I am also a very light sleeper...turned it off one night, and then no problems to sleep. Also noticed the street noise, like garbage truck, can be a nuisance if your room is on the street side like ours. Recommend this !"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The staff was wonderful. Everyone was friendly and so helpful. Darlene at the front desk always had smile. Thanks for everything guys!
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,Great helpful staff
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We came for the French Quarter Festival. I booked this hotel because it was considered in the French Quarter. Technically it was but it was so definitely on the edge. Instead of walking the Quarter, we took a taxi most of the time. The rooms were European size meaning they we quite well done but very small."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"There aren't many choices for a full-service hotel in the French Quarter, so the Best Western deserves a look. Though located in the corner of the Quarter, nothing in the neighborhood is very far away. The hotel is the sort of nice, clean property you'd expect in the budget business travel category. Nothing is spectacular, but everything is fine. It's... More"

Large hot included breakfast, free wi-fi, 3 computers to use, comfortable chairs in lobby, beautiful landscaped pool area, nice views of the Quar- ters' neighbors' hidden gardens, and excellent service. We have found our spot to stay in New Orleans."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Staff was helpful very friendly. Room was clean comfortable. Noticed that rooms were quiet.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"The hotel is located on the edge of the French Quarter across from Louis Armstrong Park. It is a moderate walk to the main attractions (Bourbon Street, French Market) through lovely neighborhood architecture. While the hotel is very modern, tit does not look like a typical Best Western. The architecture is very loyal to the New Orleans style, including a... More"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"The hotel and it's staff were great. Great location for everything we wanted over the weekend. Easy walking distance to many restaurants, including cafe du monde and bubba gump. Also, easy walking distance to places for shopping and even Bourbon St. The staff were helpful with all of our questions and providing us with a map. The only negative thing I could say is that the parking only allows for one car per room and it's 20-30 a night. Overall we had a great stay and would return!"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,I chose this location because it was in the french quarter.

I am assuming that sleep might... More
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,The hotel is in a great location close enough and far enough from Bourbon street.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Hotel was older but very clean, staff couldn't have been nicer, rooms were very clean and breakfast good!"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"Location is okay, but the hotel itself is noisy. Our air conditioning / heater was incredibly loud and the foot traffic outside our room was noisy. The check in was moderately informative but done by rote with little awareness of the responses. Room was comfortably large but could use a refurb."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"The service was great and the hotel was pretty. We got a suit and it was very spacious!

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We loved our room, the breakfast, the ambiance of the courtyard and pool area.

Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"A couple blocks from Bourbon St. Quiet area but the street hotel is on (Rampart) is broken down and looks sketchy. It was safe, but doesn't give a good impression. Free warm breakfast in the mornings was good. They have a bar and small lounge area but no kitchen. Multiple places deliver to the hotel if you dont feel like going out though. They had a parking garage. If I would have known that I probably would have rented a car for my stay. Overall a decent hotel, but nothing too fancy."

This is my...Hello Guest, Thank you for your feedback. I truly regret that we did not exceed your expectations during your trip with us. We are however happy to hear that your experience with our breakfast offering and staff were pleasant. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you so I can hear more about your stay. I hope we will..."
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"We liked the location of this hotel. It was nice to be able to park our car right there in a well lit area. The staff was helpful and the breakfast was excellent! We have stayed there twice in the past couple years.Hello Miss., Thank you for your review. We are glad to know that you enjoyed your stay with us enough to return for a second time. We hope you will continue staying with us for the years to come and sincerely thank you for staying with us. Best, Teresa Munoz - Revenue Manager"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"This hotel is in the perfect location close to the French Quarter - but, far enough from Bourbon to not hear the whooping and hollering. I can't say enough about the staff - they were warm, knowledgeable and super helpful. We spent many an evening in the courtyard resting our tired feet and quenching our thirst.Hello Guest, We are so glad to hear you enjoyed our location and amenities. We would like to thank you for your review and sincerely hope you will return as our guest in the future. Kind Regards, Teresa Munoz - Revenue Manager"
Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,"The hotel is conveniently located just next to the French Quarter. It is nice having a hotel near the quarter but just off so you do not have to listen to the nightlife when trying to sleep. The property was beautiful, particularly the courtyard and having parking available was handy. The room was a little dated but was overall clean...."

Comfort Inn,Newly renovated. Convenient location to family in Bonita Springs.
Comfort Inn,The hotel was under renovation. We were not told in advance. There were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room.
Comfort Inn,"I Can't stay, the Hotel was a Workzone"
Comfort Inn,"Worst Hotel Experience of My Life!!!!!!!!!! Spent one night there on 1/11/2016. When we checked in, the desk clerk gave us out two room keys cards and told me, in a threatening manner, that if I did not return both key cards upon checkout, I would be charged 3.00. When we arrived at our floor, there was room furniture stacked along the walls of the hallway on both sides. I plan to notify the building inspector about this because I believe it violates fire and safety codes. The phone in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night. I finally had to disconnect the phone. Went to take a shower and there was no hot water. When I went to check on my car in the morning, it was parked in by an 18 wheeler. I went to the desk, but they were no help. It took me about 45 minutes to find the driver to ask him to move the truck. He told me that the hotel staff allowed him to park there because he was delivering furniture to the hotel. When were checking out at 10:30 AM, we waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. The delay was due to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors. This would have been OK between 11:30 AM and 3:00PM (after checkout time and before check in time). But the staff in this hotel allowed the move to take place during prime checkout time. I NEVER HAD A SINGLE APOLOGY FROM THE HOTEL STAFF. MOSTLY BLANK STARES. I will never, ever stay at this place again."
Comfort Inn,Clean great location staff friendly my fourth time here loved
Comfort Inn,"Heat in room did not work, hotel was under renovation (for good reason), phone had short in handheld connection, wi-fi very poor. Workers / maids entered room even with do not disturb sign on door."
Comfort Inn,"Nicely remodeled rooms. Bathroom still seems a bit outdated, but all in all nice room."
Comfort Inn,This was a great room for the price. We highly enjoyed having sinks in both the bathroom and outside of the bathroom. The continental breakfast was average. We would definitely stay here again!
Comfort Inn,We stayed in mid march and found the area to be very overcrowded (spring break and all the snowbirds). The Comfort Inn was a breath of fresh air to us. The location was ideal for driving to the beach (also very crowded) or connecting with US41 or I-75. Amber at the front desk was a wealth of information about how... More
Comfort Inn,"Stayed at the hotel a few days. It's a no-frills place: No fitness center no vending machines as far as I could see balcony slide door lock didn't work, though there was a safety bar very small lobby housekeeping came after the first day and thereafter only to take old towels. And no dining or bar facility on site. But the hotel is up-front about all that, so no real penalty. Also, the hallway carpet was missing because it is being replaced, but hey, at least that means that they refresh the facilities every so often. Most importantly, though, the room itself was clean and quiet. And there is free breakfast. So take it for what it is: a clean, basic facility that will save you some money compared to most other hotels in the area."
Comfort Inn,A pleasant surprise to say the least! They were swapping out the furniture in the rooms while I was there so there was alot of activity. I thought maybe I made a mistake in booking but it turned out to be a great 5 days. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast and coffee were good. I was traveling solo but I could have fit a family of five in my room. The restaurant recommendations in the hotel info binder in the room are spot on! Best night sleep - comfortable bed and linens!!!
Comfort Inn,"great hotel, newly renovated. TV channels were fuzzy but serviceable. Breakfast was very good."
Comfort Inn,Friendly staff
Comfort Inn,Clean and comfortable great location for Naples and BSrings
Comfort Inn,"Very nice hotel, which is newly remodeled, very nice large rooms, nice carpets, furniture and comfortable beds. The hotel is clean, cozy and quiet, can not hear the guests of the side rooms, breakfast is also very tasty with a large selection. On the next visit Florida will definitely come back."
Comfort Inn,"At least they need to add basic need for customer like a botter of water , ice , I don't know but when u get up there there is nothing to drink"
Comfort Inn,Excellent
Comfort Inn,"Nice hotel, when we were there in March 2016 they were in process of renovating with new carpeting and beds being installed throughout. All the staff we encountered were friendly efficient. The breakfast provided at hotel was pretty blah, but the restaurant across the street, Dolly's Produce Stand, was great for breakfast and lunch."
Comfort Inn,"It was nice. Everything was being updated, new beds, furniture etc..."
Comfort Inn,This was an over night stay enroute to Key West and we were pulling a trailer. The hotel manager was very helpful in giving us a room where we could park outside the room to keep an eye on our kayaks and fishing equipment. The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff friendly. We were just stopping for the night and it was perfectly comfortable for what we needed. We arrived earlier than check in after a 12-14 hour drive and the management was gracious enough to allow us early check in.
Comfort Inn,"Very clean, very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay. The staff was helpful."
Comfort Inn,Great location- close toNaes. Great pool. Quiet hotel. Highly recommend!
Comfort Inn,"We had a very comfortable stay, room was big , we got pool view which was great. The only thing the breakfast area was very small, it was very crowded and basically was the hall. Everything else was great, free parking, good size swimming pool. we enjoyed it"
Comfort Inn,"Our stay at Comfort Inn was great. The hotel was clean. We had a king room facing the pool. The fridge size was good. The bathroom was normal hotel bathroom. small bathtub and sink. there was an additional sink outside of the hotel room for additional people to use to get ready or what ever the needs are. coffee avail in room. Breakfast was great. you can make regular waffles or blueberry waffles. eggs, sausage, fruits, danishes, muffins, toasts, yogurts. coffee, apple juice, orange juice. all you can eat. The only thing the hotel should invest in is a shuttle or someway to help get the out of town people can get to and from the beach. Also maybe upgrade the cable. Some movie channels and a guide of somesort would be nice. since it is so HOT it would be nice to stay in some a/c and watch a good movie. We were down for a wedding and did not have a car. I had read on other reviews that you can walk places and there are things to do. That is not even true. You can not walk to anything quickly. And you don't want to because it is so hot that it is miserable to walk anywhere. You need a car. Also on the way to your hotel stop and get water. The water all over Bonita Springs is awful. Get bottles."
Comfort Inn,Hotel Wifi doesn't work
Comfort Inn,There was construction taking place on my hall in various rooms. This made it a noisy place beginning around 8:00. The fan setting on the air unit did not work.
Comfort Inn,everything was find
Comfort Inn,"They are renovating the lobby so it's quite busy with that up front. The Wi-Fi was very weak. Had to go to my mobile Hot Spot. Enjoyed the price. Beds were comfortable and room felt updated and roomy. Like the extra electrical outlets and fridge and microwave. For the price, I would still stay there again."
Comfort Inn,"Great, some remodeling in lobby and dinning area bot manged well."
Comfort Inn,"Stayed initially for one night, extended for 2 more. Would have stayed longer if weekend rate wasn't going up 25. Very clean and quiet, nice pool, hot breakfast."
Comfort Inn,"This was a convenient location for our purposes. Staff was efficient. It was what we anticipated, no luxury. Pool was not heated for cooler days and no hot tub available. We were aware prior to our stay that they were renovating, however we did not expect workmen to be entering our room while we were checked in but away and this was disconcerting to return to our room and find things moved around. The hallways were cluttered with furniture and construction materials. Unsafe for children in my opinion."
Comfort Inn,Good value for prime season. Rooms newly decorated and quite large. Nice breakfast.
Comfort Inn,Teribble Hair in the bed Bugs in the room Very dangerous area I had at least 10 people ask me for money The manager and house keeper excellant but it does not make up for the safety issue. I felt I was going to get shot or killed
Comfort Inn,"A few miles to beach. This hotel was fine. Not fancy, but it was convenient enough for restaurants and the prettier areas. The breakfast layout needs some rethinking. Very crowded. The wifi never really worked, and tv was limited. Accommodations were good enough, and it was very quiet."
Comfort Inn,"great place for the price, good free cont breakfast in the AM. close to the beach and shopping if needed. clean bed and sheets, nice size room, many have balconies. the outdoor pool is nice, in May 2015 it looked as if they might be adding an outside bar area."
Comfort Inn,"Wonderful! Friendly knowlegeble staff, excellent service. Great deal for a room by the pool super clean super comfy room. We will definitely book this hotel again!"
Comfort Inn,Nice hotel. Great staff. Clean room and facility.
Comfort Inn,No one told us when we booked or when we checked in that they were replacing the carpeting in the hallways. Paint masking tape and concrete in front of our room. Mad.
Comfort Inn,"Sadly the staff at this hotel do not have a clue. Booking issues, Lied to. Promised call backs that failed to materialize. The hotel has clearly had renovations recently to make the appearance better - now to change the staff and things may improve overall."
Comfort Inn,"The price was right for the place. They were making renovations , we come back to see the renovations finished"
Comfort Inn,Nice clean quiet hotel. Reasonable price for the area. Nice breakfast choices.
Comfort Inn,"nice place, staff, breakfast. little noisy street side"
Comfort Inn,Totally just redone it is awesome still needs to update furniture
Comfort Inn,Great value for the area!
Comfort Inn,I have stayed here more than 10 times and I love it. This is my number one choice for hotels. You get a great price for a beautiful hotel room. I also use this hotel when I want to be alone and recover from a very stressful week.
Comfort Inn,My family and I stayed at this hotel for one night. The place was newly renovated and sparkling clean. Great Stay
Comfort Inn,"Good stay, quiet neighborhood- they were renovating, but it was still nice."
Comfort Inn,Newly renovated and very clean excellent deal!!!
Comfort Inn,All was good. Lights over sink basin were out. Hopefully they were replaced before the next guests.
Comfort Inn,"Room and breakfast were fine, pretty much what you would expect from a comfort Inn. The housekeeping was awful. When they made room, didn't replace towels, cups, shampoo etc. the final day they made the beds but didn't replace the towels, so we were left with two bath towels, and no hand towels, wash cloths and shampoo. Tube hadn't been cleaned bar of soap, empty shampoo containers were still there. The next morning when I when to take a shower I realized that there was no shower curtain. They had taken the curtain but hadn't replaced it ( this was pretty much typical thehouse keeping experience for our 5 day stay)."
Comfort Inn,Comfortable and clean room. Breakfast had a variety of hot and cold items where you'll find something for everyone.
Comfort Inn,"This hotel is nothing special, but it was a clean safe place to spend a couple nights while we drove to various beaches and sights in the area. Staff was helpful and friendly. While the breakfast bar had a closing time at 10, that meant you need to be there by 9:45 to get any food, as they stopped supplying... More"
Comfort Inn,"Located in Bonita Springs and only a few miles from Bonita beach, this value hotel offers travelers a clean, reasonably priced hotel with an excellent free breakfast. We stayed here for a night prior to taking the fast cat to Key West ( 30 minute drive away). The hotel is only 3 miles from bonita beach ( a straight shot... More"
Comfort Inn,Very comfortable
Comfort Inn,"Loved the hotel , very clean and updated - beds very comfortable and pool area clean - nice pool the children had a very good time in the pool . No towels at pool area . Could of used umbrellas . My only complaint is being from a near county I was charged an additional 100 deposit - never stated that when booking , was upset over it at first - but got to say the receptionist was patient with me while I vented my frustration - I was scared to have a hanger out of place or would be charged 100 . But since I know about the 100 deposit if you are considered a local - I will recommend and return to this hotel"
Comfort Inn,"The room was nice enough. A ground floor room with a sliding glass door and a balcony area. After spending one night there I realized the sliding glass door would not lock and the security bar was broken. Here I was, a woman staying alone, in an unlocked room. The maintenance man came and fixed the bar. I told my... More"
Comfort Inn,It was great I will stay here again and recommend this hotel to all my friends and family
Comfort Inn,the price was very affordible florida residence and AAA get a discount hotels .com said they were booked but when i called i was able to get a room huge pool free breakfast clean room i have and would stay here again
Comfort Inn,This hotel has everything you can expect from a low budget hotel. Breakfast has varied item. There's a lot of space in the breakfast area. Room are clean and has been renovated. We were there only one night and we ended saying that we should have stayed longer.
Comfort Inn,"15min drive to the beach. Hot breakfast -nothing fancy, but it is always nice to have eggs and waffles in the morning. Pool seems to please the other kids (we only opted for the beach). Restaurants around (a lot available in a 10-15min drive) including nice ones, but none of them were accepting reservations (at least 1h to 1h30 wait for the Christmas period) -good to know when traveling with young kids."
Comfort Inn,"The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. It appeared newly refurbished. 2 sinks is very helpful for a family. It would be nice if the breakfast was extended a little later than 9:30. The eating area is a little cramped. The breakfast was simple but good. Overall, I enjoyed the hotel stay."
Comfort Inn,The lights in the room were not bright--hard for my husband to shave.
Comfort Inn,"Wonderful, outstanding, and everything was perfect."
Comfort Inn,"This hotel is really ok... the rooms are clean and comfortable. The only problem we had, though, was that management decided to rip up the hallway carpet and install new carpeting -- a laudable endeavor but not at the height of Bonita Springs' season, March!!!! The noise from the drilling and hammering was AWFUL, and the SMELL from the new carpet glue made it difficult to sleep at night. We did complain to management, and they agreed to give us 15 off for two nights to compensate us. I really thought they should have comped us a night. I can't believe that no one else complained. The hotel seemed pretty full."
Comfort Inn,"The hotel is average.room was clean. The bed and pillows were very comfy and the free breakfast was somewhat larger than other hotels I've stay at. There is one elevator that is adjacent to the lobby so if you had the misfortune of getting a room on the third floor on the opposite end of the hotel, as I did,... More"
Comfort Inn,"The rooms have been remodeled and look great! We were wowed when we walked in and saw how large the room was, that it had a table with 4 chairs (that NEVER happens and was a definite plus since there are 4 of us!), a balcony, and a sink outside the bathroom as well as inside it. Beds were a great size. Breakfast was ok- one waffle maker, pastries and cereal, also egg patties and meat- we dont eat meat though. The location was only 10 mins from the beach!"
Comfort Inn,"Nice place, shout out to Grace for the great attitude and smile! A few miles west of I-75 and 4 miles to Bonita Springs Beach with some decent eateries in the area. Every room has a balcony/Porch. Dolly's restaurant is across the street. Nice, slightly cramped, breakfast area. Outdoor pool. Our room was opposite the road and very quiet. We... More"
Comfort Inn,This hotel charges for your room keys if you do not leave them. 2 per key and when I recv'd my credit bill I was charged 33.30. Called the hotel twice and both times was assured a credit would be issued. That did not happen and I had to go through my credit card co. and let them handle it.
Comfort Inn,Great stay. Recently remodeled. Friendly staff.
Comfort Inn,Very nice addition of hot tub in pool area would be great
Comfort Inn,"This hotel is still going through renovations but the work did not get in our way. I would stay here again! The staff, room and location were great. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends."
Comfort Inn,"The beds were the best part. Nice and comfy. The room overall was okay. There were a few lights out and a few ceiling tiles were a bit shoty. But overall again, it was a nice hotel with friendly staff (Grace). The pool was very nice and and the pool with the surrounding area was clean. Oh, as well as... More"
Comfort Inn,"The hotel is well positioned off the main highway, and close enough to the beach. They are going to rip out all the bathrooms soon, so that will help a lot as the bathrooms are just okay. The breakfast, which granted is included in the price, not free, is poor. I have a hatred of all things plastic on the... More"

Comfort Inn,My wife and I decided to explore the SW Florida area for our 26th Wedding Anniversary. We are loyal Choice Hotel customers and this hotel was perfectly located.

Comfort Inn,"We stayed here while visiting our daughter who attends FGCU. We wanted to try something a little further away and in a different area than we normally stay. This place was perfect. The facility was clean, staff was friendly and the free breakfast (which can sometimes be inedible at hotels) was better than expected. We would recommend this hotel and will probably stay there again on our next visit."
Comfort Inn,"We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the room was that it was a large room. We had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable, and the many fluffy pillows were great. Our room was pool side so that was nice. Breakfast was waffles, sausage, eggs, fruit, yogurt, muffins, etc. More than enough to get the day started. Staff... More"
Comfort Inn,"Because we were in high season and last-minute, the cost was extremely high. Other than that complaint, this was a clean and pleasant hotel with a good location.

Comfort Inn,Grace was so helpful and has a contagious personality which made our stay a pleasure. The property was clean even though it could use some cosmetic updates. The breakfast was more than expected. This is our second stay at the hotel and expect to return again next year. Thank you for a wonderful start to our vacation.
Comfort Inn,"Came down here for a wedding and let's face it, there not that many places in Bonita. The place was good enough for an inn. Front desk lady was rude one day when a pipe broke and the water was shut down but other than that I would stay here again. Breakfast was decent."
Comfort Inn,Great place! Breakfast was plentiful and varied. Great service!
Comfort Inn,"I just love this hotel , very clean , and very clean pool and pool area.

Comfort Inn,Room was disgusting. Dirty and had strong chemical odor. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Front desk could have cared less. Would not recommend. Did not feel safe. Police were here in the evening about a fight between two individuals. Noisy all night.
Comfort Inn,We had to travel to Glasgow for a family wedding and got a room at the Comfort Inn. Staff was nice and the hotel was really nice place to stay. Nice bedding.

Comfort Inn,place wasn't to clean. they did some painting there. didn't see wet paint sign until too late. won't be my first choice.
Comfort Inn,"noisy, aged and worn interior. clean and friendly but gaps under doors let light in, smoke detector beeped in hall all night, can hear everything in hall."
Comfort Inn,The hotel was nice and clean....however I had an issue with the dead insects and crickets throughout the room. The room could have also had a more pleasant smell.
Comfort Inn,"We travel frequently with short overnight stays. As we're retired, I generally look for bargains and have found that you generally get what you pay for when it comes to lodging. So, for our stay in Edinburg, Texas, my wife persuaded me to pay a bit more, and I'm glad that I did. The free breakfast was quite good with an outstanding number of choices for everyone. The one exception was the scrambled eggs, which were obviously not directly from the shell. The omelettes more than compensated, however. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and odor-free. Every staff member we encountered was courteous and friendly. Parking was convenient. The nicest touch was the choice of pillows in the room: firm or soft. We both slept quite well, unusual for us without our own pillows and on the first night of a stay."
Comfort Inn,"This Hotel was built sideways to avoid facing the busy highway. When I checked in, I was assigned the room facing the highway on the side of the building. I asked for another room and the Clerk not only graciously changed my room, she gave me a bigger room for the same price. I was impressed with the outstanding customer service. The breakfast is better than what is offered in most hotels. I found the bacon wasn't cooked enough and asked if they could make some crispier for the following morning. When the Clerk saw me arrive to breakfast, he immediately had the Kitchen staff make crispy bacon for me. I can't say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are. Tuesday through Thursday, they offer Happy Hour from 5:30 to 7:30PM. Great variety of cold beers as well as wine. The appetizers were different each night. This Comfort Inn is expanding by doubling their size and making suites. The addition is supposed to be ready by July. I never heard the construction from my room. I already booked this same Hotel the next time I am in Edinburg for business. Tons of nearby restaurants and shops. They offer 4 pillows for each bed. Two pillows are firm and two are soft. Love this Comfort Inn. They know how to distinguish themselves."
Comfort Inn,Comfortable and close to things

Take pictures of everything the wanted to charge me 100 for a comforted that they said it was stain after I left even tho it wasn't stain by us.. But when I went back to look at it they already had it on the bedroom .. For someone else to used., they figured cause I was from out of town I wld come back n check . It's a scam..

Comfort Inn,To our surprise the hotel is under construction therefore the pool is not working at point. Also the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have water. We asked for management to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius. It was an inconvenient especially when your children are coming along.

Comfort Inn,"Only one negative, our fridge was rusted and the fan in the fridge would make three LOUD taps when it stopped. We thought someone was knocking. It kept waking us up."
Comfort Inn,Comfortable and quiet. Breakfast the same everyday and limited.
Comfort Inn,"Me and wife stayed there Saturday Dec 6 2014 the hotel was great, the room was clean, the restroom and shower were excellent. Definitely we would stay there again."
Comfort Inn,Hotel under remodeled but no noise or mess inside the building. Handicap room was big and the roll in shower was great
Comfort Inn,Very Clean and friendly atmosphere. Rooms were clean as well as over all hotel. Breakfast was most enjoyable as well as the weekly social hours
Comfort Inn,"If you are considering a stay at this Comfort Inn in the near future, just know the pool and spa are closed due to construction. The nice pool area was a major reason I chose to book our family there. When I reserved a room for 2 adults 2 kids it would have been proper and considerate of them... More"
Comfort Inn,"Came to the local university on business. Hotel is fine, but google had its location way off when I booked it. Thought I could walk to campus and took a cab there. Well, had to take cab back to the airport to rent a car. Not many dinner options around, unless you drive. The room was huge and very comfy. Internet was kinda spotty, but the spots where the coverage was good, it was reliable."
Comfort Inn,excelent
Comfort Inn,A comfy place to crash. Nice staff in the office.
Comfort Inn,Hotel was very accommodating and friendly. Clean and comfortable rooms.
Comfort Inn,Everything was awesome except pool needed cleaning
Comfort Inn,We were disappointed that there was no swimming pool but we had access to a sister hotel not far away.
Comfort Inn,"The hotel is confortable, good breakfast and very nice price"
Comfort Inn,"We booked a room for 3 nights at the Comfort Inn Edinburg,TX The first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and hair on the bed sheets. We notified the front desk and we're told that they could give us a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas. We were forced to move to a different hotel across the street. And we were told by the Comfort Inn that they would not refund us anything. We had paid in advance. We tried contacting the corporate office but we're given the run around after being on hold for 30 minutes. The hotel offered a complimentary stay if we choose to decide to stay with them in the future. Of course we said no we would not use them again but asked why could we not get refunded at least 2 nights but yet we were offered a free night. They again said they would not refund us anything. I am very disappointed at the quality of service and quality of the room at this hotel. I recommend you do not stay here, unless you don't mind fleas and unclean sheets."
Comfort Inn,"The only issue we had was the breakfast. The in-room book said breakfast was available until 10. At 8:45 my youngest and I went down and started eating. At 9 we noticed all the items being cleared away, so we texted the other famy members to hurry down since the food was being taken away. I was able to get my husband a plate, but that was it. Otherwise, it was a good place to stay."
Comfort Inn,"Overall, it was good. the hotel was and still is, in the process of renovation, but it did not bother me. The room was clean, and I had everything that I needed. I had a great breakfast.."
Comfort Inn,I can't say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are for their guests. The consistently go above and beyond. This is my third time staying at this Comfort Inn and I'll be back again in June. The beds are more comfortable and you have an option of a soft or firm pillow with each bed. The shower head offers different water pressures and they recently changed their security system for all their doors. You can't beat the service for the price of the room.
Comfort Inn,A great place to stay for a phenomenal Price! The room was clean and ready for guests. Breakfast location was well prepared and inviting.
Comfort Inn,"We had to switch rooms. The air quality in the first room was not acceptable. It had a damp feel. They were very accommodating though. However, when we got into the second room, it smelled like cheap cologne. We stayed. It was bearable. The breakfast in the morning was okay."
Comfort Inn,"Very good place to stay. One minor issue, a foul odor came from the sink."
Comfort Inn,Very friendly at check in desk
Comfort Inn,"The room we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke. Then they switched us to another room on the first floor, next to the temporary entrance, and we could hear people coming in and out all night. We will not be staying at this hotel again and no swimming pool."
Comfort Inn,"This was a last minute booking. What a huge surprise, the rooms are enormous. These rooms have so much room, even with two beds, chair, sofa and desk. It has a nice hallway and even a small space by the door for extra storage or to set up ironing board. Clean and enjoyable."
Comfort Inn,"No complaints whatsoever. Every hotel should be run like this one. The complimentary breakfast was especially good, and the bed was very comfortable."
Comfort Inn,Staff very friendly and the hotel was clean.
Comfort Inn,I've stayed at this hotel in the different occasions....my satisfaction with it had steadily declined. Horrible and uncomfortable stay this past weekend!!!
Comfort Inn,There to see south Texas museum
Comfort Inn,The overall stay was nice. Our room we reserved was given away but the staff made sure we had a room that was to our satisfaction. The room was big and had allot of room for my 4 yr old to play. Only down side to room was the a/c made the room really humid and some times uncomfortable. Breakfast was the typical breakfast at hotels. Saw two bugs in room but nothing serious.
Comfort Inn,It was a family visit and I got to relax and felt welcomed.
Comfort Inn,The person at the desk was extremely helpful. The stay was great.
Comfort Inn,"Nice hotel near Mcallen and also Mercedes, tx. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was ok!"
Comfort Inn,"I stay at this hotel every time i visit in the Valley. It is my home away from home. Staff is great, rooms are comfortable, breakfast is great. They treat customers with alot of care and with lots TLC."

Comfort Inn,"The Check-in was quick and easy, friendly staff, but i had booked the rooms days prior, staff let me know about breakfast in the am. The room was clean, organized and quiet. We stayed only for one night but didnt stay the whole night because my daughter got sick and decided to drive back home. The staff at night though was not so friendly. Overall it was a great hotel and would stay again on my next visit!!"
Comfort Inn,"It was great, enjoy staying here everytime."
Comfort Inn,The one night stay was great!
Comfort Inn,"Hotel was under construction because they were adding on. This made it a little noisy during the day, but it did not effect the great service and wonderful rooms- and don't forget the awesome breakfast. Would book there again for sure."
Comfort Inn,"The bathroom needed a little msintenance, tiles were missing along the shower wall."
Comfort Inn,Had to attend a funeral in Edinburg. Chose the Comfort Inn due to proximity of places we would be going to. The price of the room was also attractive. The hotel itself is nice and has attractive grounds. There is construction going on as it is expanding its room availability. The noise was not an issue. The front staff are... More

Rooms are beds very comfortable, with all the usual Comfort Inn amenities. Clean bathrooms. Very nice small pool area and hot tub. Fitness and business center also located on the property. Pay for use coin laundry available. Typical Comfort Inn hot... More"
Comfort Inn,"My only complaint about this hotel is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room. The staff was courteous enough to change our room, but the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much."
Comfort Inn,"so it felt very much like a budget hotel (almost to the level of motel), the bed was way more stiffer than I expected (woke up with sore shoulders and back), the breakfast was alright (the usual you get when breakfast is included in this price range kind of hotel), but the hotel in general had a bit of a funky smell (oldish maybe a bit moldish)...we usually stay down the street at the best western and between the two the best western is better...the best western has been remodeling stuff and seems to have kept up with consumer needs a bit better.."
Comfort Inn,I've been staying here for years and the overall condition has improved during this past year.
Comfort Inn,We stayed here for a weekend as our kids were participating in a chess tournament. Our stay was pleasant with only issue is we weren't acknowledge as an Elite Member. This hotel is well maintained and clean. Our beds were comfortable and these were probably the best pillows I've ever slept on in a hotel. The rooms were spacious which... More
Comfort Inn,Drove to McAllen Tx from Dallas Tx. It was 100 degrees in McAllen. Told the clerk our room was not cooling after being in the room for 6hrs. A/C would cut off every 2mins. Maint man said give it time. So we did. That night our room temp was 87 degrees. For some reason the Maint man wasn't around the next day. I had to raise hell in order to get them to replace the unit. WOW!!!!! It was finally replaced the next day. I love comfort suit hotels but that bunch of workers/Maint man just didn't give a care....
Comfort Inn,"The price is right, what a pleasant surprise Room is clean spacious staff is friendly. The breakfast was clean, and the lady taking care of the breakfast area was very attentive. The suit is great for a family of five. I will definitely stay again."
Comfort Inn,Hotel was under construction so no pool or hot tub. The rooms were large and comfortable. Breakfast was great!! Loved that they had our favorite Shipley's Do-Nuts!
Comfort Inn,"I stayed 5 nights in April. The room was clean and most importantly the bed was very comfortable, I slept well which is not always the case! The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a moderately priced abode in Edinburg Texas."
Comfort Inn,"Stayed for 3 nights on labor day weekend for a family event. I knew there was construction but the price was fair. Construction wasn't bad. Breakfast was good, the staff was very professional and friendly. Conveniently located near shopping and restraunts. The two down falls were limited parking and there was NO POOL as advertised."
Comfort Inn,"I have only one semi-negative thing to say about this hotel and gonna give it a five anyway. Everything was great! We were there for a funeral for two nights. We had three rooms and each was very very clean. The service staff, paint job, the carpet,the beds,the restroom ,we found nothing bad in any of our rooms(212,215,217) except mine,... More"
Comfort Inn,Unhappy - construction made the place look dirty and unkept. I was given a handicap room that I didn't request. I think the hotel's reputation would have been better served to close it down during construction.
Comfort Inn,Overall stay was good not excellent because The A/C wasn't very cold. Location was great for shoppers.
Comfort Inn,"This hotel was fine for a business trip (clean, comfortable, nice staff and breakfast). They are currently renovating, so I'm sure on future stays it will be really nice."
Comfort Inn,"Checked into the hotel, initially was checked into third floor which the entire floor was like being in a Sauna! HOT!!!!

Comfort Inn,From the moment we walked through the front doors until we checked out all staff members we encountered were enthusiastic and helpful. You can tell this runs through the whole team that were there. Certainly a 'must try' location for every traveller who goes near this location.
Comfort Inn,"Caught in a blizzard....drove for hours and hours and didn't know where we would stop....this place was awesome.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"From check in to check out Mountain Lodge never disappoints. Staff is exceptional, the grounds are lovely, and the rooms are impeccable."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"This was the first time I stayed at the Mountain Lodge but not the first time in Telluride. I was quite disappointed. For the price of the 2 bedroom condo, I was expecting much more. There was no bellmen to help with the bags. There was also no room service and the restaurant at the hotel was not open all the time. I had to call the front desk for several things, and they were very short to get off the phone. The 2 bedroom condo that we reserved was small. We needed to call for housekeeping daily to service. Sorry, I expected more disappointed. Will definitely not be staying here again."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Room was great and very spacious. The staff at this hotel was one of the best I have ever encountered. We enjoyed our stay very much.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"I stepped out of my comfort zone decided to take a trip alone. Although I didn't get to the hotel until 1am, The young man at the front desk was very polite and welcoming. The room was clean and waking up in the morning to a site of trees and log cabin style buildings was a great refresher. The staff was always courteous and attentive to any questions and request that I had. The hotel is located perfectly on the mountain giving easy access to the gondolas and other activities within walking distance. Already booked a week stay over Thanksgiving with the family. Would definitely suggest this hotel to anyone going to Mountain Village/Telluride."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"I stayed in a one bedroom, by myself and thoroughly enjoyed my time alone. I liked the fireplace and the jacuzzi bathtub. The room has a small but very functional kitchen for my needs. I just needed to toast an english muffin in the morning before skiing."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We enjoyed our stay here. lovely little jr. suite that was like our own apartment. the gondola rides were great and easy. the casual restaurant was good with a lovely view.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The girl at the front desk was very unfriendly and looked annoyed that I was there. She never looked me in the eye, didn't explain any features about the property, pool access, restaurant times, nothing! She was rude. My tiny room would have been fine except...the coffee pot was broken, I only had decaf in my room and it was an adjoining room where I could hear the entire conversation of the folks in the next room. I was kept up at night througout my whole stay due to stomping footsteps above me, a barking dog too. I hardly slept."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We were rerouted to a different location due to over booking. It worked out perfectly for us as we had a rental car. Beautiful area and condos. Could not have expected more.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Wonderful. Gondolas in Telluride are free. Leave car at hotel and ride the gondola to Telluride village. The hotel staff really treated us as special guests.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Beautiful view, great market a short walk away that has everything from meat to baked goods and great fresh coffee. This is where you pick up the free shuttle to down town. The condo had a few issues. The up stairs electric heater ran on high with no way to turn it off. The up stairs toilet also constantly ran,...

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Got stuck inside elevator for 30 minutes when heading to music festival with our gear. No auxiliary power / generator apparently, so no light or air available and could've been a problem had we been stuck longer. Staff/management didn't seem concerned, as they never followed up with us to make sure we were alright. We also missed most of the performance of the band we wanted to see. Property was fine generally, but this left a bad taste in our mouths."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,went for the weekend Telluride Film festival. Location was close to the Gondola which was great food at restaurant was excellent and lower priced than in towns. The room was a 2 bedroom condo style which gave my husband and I privacy - my 21 year old son and a friend had the 2 twin beds upstairs
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Took my family on a weekend ski trip. The rooms were nice, bedding was a little worn, but overall the 2 bedroom condo was very nice. Full kitchen was very nice for breakfast and a couple dinners. The View (the lodge restaurant) had amazing food, especially 5 burger. Walk from room to hot tub and pool was a little far in the cold. Ski-in/Ski-out was nice as was having Christy Sport's for rentals on-site. Shuttle service takes you to/from gondola whenever you like. The only real negative was the paper thin walls, you could hear TV from next door, kids running around, etc..."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Morning Noon or night the view from both the Lodge and our room of the Sneffel Mountains is beautiful.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Lovely grounds, nice people and facilities overall BUT for the Expedia 'deal' that cost us 200 we were put in a room that is an add on to the regular suite. It was super small ( we had a full bed instead of the queen size we paid for) and we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door/walls. Just be aware of what you're buying."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"had a great time, great location. Be prepared to take gondola into town because the hotel shuttle doesn't take you there."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The hotel is beautiful! It's walking distance (though they have a shuttle if the altitude is hard on you) to the gondola into town. The restaurant overlooks the mountains and is a wall of glass. They arranged two functions for us and both were handled perfectly, even when I threw in extra people at the last minute. Chef Bud is great."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Nice check in with pleasant young man. I noticed there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have. No food available because it was off season (not even apples which most hotels offer as well). If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning. The young man checking us out was same person checking us in. He was pleasant."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The lodge room was spartan with no desk or shelf area nor chair. If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job. Expensive for such a poorly equipped room."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The room we were given was so small we couldn't even put our suitcase opened anywhere. The blanket at the foot of the bed smelled like dirty feet....the maid left our room door wide open when she finished, and good thing we went back for an umbrella and found it this way, or it would have been open to anybody all day."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We have stayed at the Mountain Lodge twice and really enjoy it. The property is beautiful. Very easy to get around Mountain Village and gondola access to Telluride. We stayed in the two bedroom condo this year and it was perfect for our family of four. The *only* complaint is the lack of parking. We were told they have 140 units and only 25 parking spaces so when they are busy its mandatory valet. We visited in the summer and had hiking, biking fishing day trips planned so it was somewhat of an inconvenience to have to rely on valet parking the first day. Mid week we were able to self park."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We enjoyed our stay. It was very quiet and private. Outside parking was inadequate.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,All and all our stay was a good one. A couple of kinks-no wash clothes or face towels at check in and the bathroom fan did not work other than that it was a pleasant stay. ps.. they should also make it clear that you will be billed a 20. per day parking fee.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Will find another spot next time.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"It was a bit overpriced for the tiny little room with the soft bed we were booked in. The manager offered us a bigger room, but since we only had one more night until we were off on our next great adventure, we decided to stay in the room we were in. The bed really needed to be replaced, it was way too soft. The valet service was a bit of a hassle, though they were quick about getting our vehicle to us. The dog fee was a bit steep. At least the stunning snow capped mountains surrounding the lodge was free. Thank goodness, because the view was priceless!"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We stayed here on our honeymoon (Sept) and try to stay here every year for my husbands Birthday (Oct).

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The hotel room was average at best but I realize it is a ski resort and hard to keep like in a beech resort. Skiers are looking for a dry place to put their wet clothe and ski's for the night. The price was right and the location couldn't have been any better. I would recommend my friends to stay for that reason.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Zero sound insulation between rooms and not a single chair provided to sit on. Asked at front desk for folding chairs and told we should consider a room upgrade next time - no thanks.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We come to Telluride quite a bit and always stay at Mountain Lodge Telluride- we always are treated well and the staff is so great- especially Chris and Robert.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"telluride is a great place and the gondola that runs to 2.00am in the morning is handy .that being said are rm was a shoe box (hotel was over booked)we were told we would get a bigger rm but then we were told we would have to pay extra.parking is an issue so they were suppose to comp the 20.00dollar a day charge ,but ended up charging us anyway ,other than that we had a blast in telluride"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The accommodations were very nice, clean, comfortable. The location was beautiful.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Mountain Village Lodge never fails to to impress! Whether you're looking for location, great rooms, accommodating and friendly staff, or great views, you'll find them here! Truly the best place to stay in Mountain Village.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"This was our first time to Mountain Village and a very kind and very helpful young man, Chad, made our experience memorable. Chad made sure we had everything we needed. This Lodge is located in a beautiful area and with the gondola located so close it was easy to into the town of Telluride."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Awesome Mountain Village location, close to Gondola, shuttle bus drops off and picks up around Mountain Village. Stayed in a 4 bedroom Cabin, directly on the slope, lovely mountain log home feel, kitchen a bit small and lacked quality kitchen fixtures (pots, pans, tools...). Unfortunately, every bed in the cabin was terrible, and I can attest to that as over... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The ski access is actually on the east side of the property. If you are staying in the large building (on the west side of the property), you need to lug your skis across the street, through the pool area, and then down a pathway east of the main lodge. Not terribly convenient if you are expecting to ski out."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Discerning skiers need look no further than Mountain Lodge for the best vacation!

Kitchen, living room, dining room, two fireplaces and a large double balcony with a view of the mountains that you can't beat. Ask for the view. Walk a hundred feet and your in the main lodge which... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"This is the second time I have stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. It's a beautiful location on the mountain. We were upgraded to a larger one bedroom condo which was nice. Only complaint was due to loud noises that occurred off and on throughout day time hours (sounded like furniture being moved over and over above us). It was only during he day, so not a tremendous issue."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We spent our Anniversary here last summer and could not have found a place more accommodating. The views were stunning and the room superlative.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The staff at mountain lodge was not helpful and I found everyone to have an attitude. The shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very nice. Christopher, however was the nicest employee."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"I enjoyed my stay here very much. The staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and comfortable. The room was a little dated but very clean and comfortable. I believe they are in the process of renovating them so this will probably change pretty quick. You can't beat the location, a couple hundred yards to the gondola into town. I will definitely stay here again in the future."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We had a great stay and the staff was excellent. What a beautiful hotel.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Though it was a clean room, it was very small, and the bed was very soft. The valet parking was a nuisance,however the valets were quick about getting our vehicle. The 50 a day dog fee, I think, was a bit steep. It's not like we own a Great Dane. We have a little 16 pound dog. The snow capped... More"

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The restaurant here is unbelievably delicious and has a burger for 5!! Also the hotel staff Bryan, Mackenzie, and more were so polite, answered all of my questions, and were able to accommodate all of my somewhat picky requests! Will be back with friends!!"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Over the phone staff was very helpful, friendly and comforting, when we arrived front desk staff was very helpful and nice! Security and night staff on the other hand had a problem with what seemed like everyone, very rude and flat out told us that if we did not like anything that we could go to another lodge, keep in mind we booked a suite so very loved everything else but the management needs to control comments and overall rudeness of night staff. Rooms were perfect, our stove was fixed in a timely manner! Had a great stay just left a bad taste in my mouth as far as the night staff goes"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Everything you want in a cozy mountain retreat and at a decent, at least for Telluride, price. Restaurant is has good food and great views. Overall hotel service is good with the caveat that when things get busy, the staff is not big enough to handle everything instantly. Management is flexible-on a more recent trip we had to cancel at... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"This hotel is surrounded by such beauty! The room was amazing and very close to a gondola to get to all attractions and restaurants! This resort is surrounded by trees and greenery. I would most definitely go again. I heard thatbit's amazing in the winter for skiing! if you ski, I highly recommend."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The room was next to the elevator and the noise was continual. Breakfast is not included with this Hotel and they charge you 20 per day to park!
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We stayed in the 2 bedroom deluxe condo. It was comfortable, roomy and pleasant to stay in for a couple of days. I liked the 1/2 bath for guests so they didn't need to use the bathrooms we were using. The kitchen was roomy for two cooks. The staff was friendly pleasant. The outdoor pool needs some tile repair."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Lovely place and view! A bottle cap and wrist band from prior guests was found In the room. However it was otherwise very well kept! Loved the convenience of riding the gondola into town with my dog!
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The view was spectacular but the benefits stop there. Our room was small bed had a foot gap between headboard mattress. I think next time we'll try AirBnB or a telluride hotel. My recommendation, save the sticker shock on this stay or insist seeing the room first."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,We staid in a 4 bedroom cabin with several friends for the labor day weekend. Everyone loved it and enjoyed the mountain views and convenience to the free gondola into town. Great place to cook and grill when looking for another alternative to eat out. Staff were fantastic and the place was very well maintained and comfortable.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The people above us were really loud. The floor stomping was over the top. The view was not at all as expected since all we could view was the gondola. The only other issue was lack of privacy as the folks that were on the gondola could see right into the room. I confirmed the view into the room from when my husband and I took the gondola ourselves. Perhaps the place was clean because you had the experience as though company was coming and on thei way.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Parking wasn't convenient. Husband has heart trouble and had difficulty walking up hill to lodge office to get car from valet. Also left some important personal items in room and staff weren't very responsive to checking on them same day after we left.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Beyond the incredible views of the rugged cliffs overlooking the Mountain Village area above Telluride, this resort offers a dog-friendly, mostly car-free environment for hiking, rock climbing, and mt. biking. A well-prepped staff, excellent concierge and valet services in particular, means a clean stay. The condo rentals especially provide ample room and a quiet rest. With a small creek running... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We made a short trip to Telluride, mostly to view Fall foliage. Unfortunately we were a little bit late for the peak of that. The room we reserved was actually described on the web site as a tiny room -- surprisingly. Seemed to be a lock-off room that is part of a larger condo unit. It was by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in but was rather poorly designed, especially in the bathroom closet area. Finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of a challenge -- it was hidden in the cabinet under the sink. Similarly the one waste basket was hidden in a back corner behind the toilet. The toilet and bath/shower were in a separate compartment with a ridiculous door that was just about impossible to close. I didn't try. The shower/bath combo had sliding glass doors that made it very awkward to use also -- a curtain would have been far better. Much of the closet space was totally inaccessible with a floor mounted safe facing sideways -- would have been a challenge to use. The toilet was extraordinarily low, as was the one easy chair in the room. It took a long time for the electric wall heater to warm the room and its contents to a comfortable temperature tho it was not that cold outside yet. Other than this, it was a nice enough room with a decent view. Not only was there a hefty fee for parking, it turned out that valet parking was mandatory and that parking seemed in very short supply. Excellent hamburgers in the restaurant."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The View (our restaurant) is the only place in Telluride that serves 1/2-yards of beer!

And ask for Luis!!"

Mountain Village has a free gondola that travels over... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"This was a small but clean room in the stunningly beautiful Mountain Village just above Telluride. The gondola station, with the free gondola ride into Telluride, was only a short walk but the hotel ran shuttles on request. A great place to stay for time in Telluride. The view from the gondola alone is worth the trip."

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"First trip to Telluride and this is a very nice Hotel with a very Lodge-like feel. However the room accorded us through the Hotels.Com booking was Spartan at best consisting of a bed, a closet, a shower and nothing else! This was unfortunate as occupancy at the lodge/Hotel was not crowded and the Hotel Management staff there certainly had the flexibility to assign a room more representative of the quality at this facility.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The good news is the main lodge was nice. Service at its bar/ restaurant was glacially slow. The rooms were: 1)impossible to find with no wayfinding signage 2)dirty- found several cigarettes on the closet shelf 3) poorly designed- you have to almost stand on the toilet to close the bathroom door.
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The Mountain Lodge has an outstanding appearance from the outside. It has a log cabin feel with excellent lighting. The outdoor pool and hot tub are also a plus in addition to the lounges that surround the pool area. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,Thanks Lisa for a great time at the View at mountain lodge! And thanks for your amazing patience with our kiddos!!! We came to Telluride with five families and all the most came to the lodge for some apres ski food drinks and hot tub time. Lisa was so great with our kids and conscientious.

Front desk stated they did not have any 2-beds available since they started remodeling early to get ready for the winter season.

The location, the accommodations, the view, the suite layout, kitchenette, TVs, etc. A few gripes: 1) No good temperature control.

The restaurant at the Lodge was delicious and the service was great. We have stayed before in the units with kitchens and fireplaces when we had more people with us.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"Room had no air handling unit. Only source of fresh air was to open a window. Most all other guests had Windows open and the noisy coming from other guests was very loud. Very loud obnoxious music was coming from every direction. The window covering would only raise about 8 inches the window itself would not stay open without a garbage can holding it up. The screen on the window was torn. Parking was mandatory valet at 20.00. Many other guests disregarded parking rules and were parked in drive paths making it most difficult to load and unload luggage, or emergencies vehicles if needed. Staff was courteous and polite."

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We stumbled upon this lodge after backing out of an AirBnB for being cramped and unwelcoming. Chris Webber at the front desk of the Mountain Lodge turned our frown upside down. He was super enthusiastic about all the amenities and made us feel very welcome. Our two nights there were excellent. The ski-in-ski-out location, the View Bar and Grill, the... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,we visited in summer - the access to the back side of the mountain and the views were great. the ride into town is completely reliant on the gondola (which takes a while and can have long lines during festival times) and the hotel shuttle won't take you into town (i'm not sure where it does go....!). the property was...

We typically stay at another property in Mountain Village, but since it was high season (New Year's weekend), our usual spot was booked and we were glad to snag a 1 BR Suite at the Mountain Lodge, as I've wanted to try it. If only I knew... Here's the list of grievances: -The... More"

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"We booked this hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor. First time to Telluride and the hotel was what one pictures when they think of a mountain lodge. We arrived early and were informed our room was not ready but they would call us as soon as it was. We took the gondola into Telluride and enjoyed lunch. Arriving back, the... More"
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The views were breathtaking but other than this we were not blown away considering the cost and the star level.

Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,"The hotel and staff are excellent, easy access to the gondola and the view are spectacular. The food a The View was very good. Rooms are spacious and pet friendly. We had a wonderful time, highly recommend this hotel. My only complaint is that that rooms are too hot in the summer and there's no A/C, which is understandable in the mountains, and there are too many bugs to keep the porch door open. They probably need to install ceiling fans to make it more comfortable to sleep."
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,The hotel had the most beautiful views. Close proximity to the gondola to go into town or the village. The fact that it has a restaurant was a plus since most do not. Excellent well equipped kitchens helped with making this a easy trip with 4 children under 12. Clarks grocery in town is the best options since the nearby... More
Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,I really like the location of the Lodge. It's easy to get to the Town of Telluride and being able to ski in/ski out saves you so much time and energy schlepping. Their onsite restaurant is perfect in every way and the prices are fair for such a creative menu. The size of the lodge isn't overpowering and the rooms... More

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"My boyfriend and I recently took a trip to see a hockey game and chose this hotel because it looked nice, but specifically for the hot tub. There were plenty of other nicer and cheaper in walking distance of this one but we chose this one so we could relax in the hot tub. To our surprise, the hot tub... More"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Great stay. I did call ahead and ask about the evening reception. I was told that they served finger foods. My husband and I stopped for dinner before arriving. We were disappointed that the reception is far more than finger foods, and didn't need to stop and eat on the way in. The reception would have been fine. On the other hand, the breakfast was awful and the only edible food was the Belgium waffles."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"We were in town last weekend for an event at the Nationwide Arena, and were VERY pleased we chose this hotel for our stay.

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Beth was wonderful at the front desk. Clean and quiet. great stay.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Great stay except Pool closes at 10 and does not open until 9am. That meant we could not use it at 10:15pm and we left at 9 am. More hours would be nice.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"It was very safe, convenient very comfortable."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,This place is pet friendly! We love traveling with our dog. Thanks Drury Inn!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Excellent service. Very friendly and helpful staff and managers. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool area was decent. No bar/lounge but they made up for it with 3 free drinks during happy hour. Overall we were ecstatic about our experience and would definitely choose to stay here again!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Clean, great neighborhood, great service. I marked off for comfort because the pillows were especially small beyond the point of being uncomfortable, and I'm not especially picky when it comes to sleeping conditions. That said, the breakfast was good, staff was helpful and friendly, and everything was clean. We stayed there to see a show and basically just slept there and ate and left in the morning, but really no complaints. Would recommend to anyone."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"The free breakfast and the Kickback in the evening are lovely benefits. Appreciating that the kitchen likely does not have a grill, I'd love to see thick ham slices or microwaved bacon along with the pallid gray, limp sausage patties and maybe a more whole grain bread. A little fresh cut up fruit, maybe chopped walnuts along with plain low fat Greek yogurt would be other nice additions to breakfast, and maybe cinnamon or cooked apples to accompany the oatmeal. I'll be coming back to the hotel every two or three months."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"The property is conveniently located adjacent to the convention center and near all other Downtown hotels. Had a great one-night stay at a fair price which includes wiFi, breakfast, alcoholic happy hour drinks etc. The hotel is near all trendy bars and restaurants within walking distance making it a great choice. Highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"New Years Eve, we had a great time!! Booking again for next year!!"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,best place to stay for conventions!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Stayed several times at this location. Excellent every time. The breakfast was very good selection of items and the free drinks and food provided in the evening was added bonus. It wasn't anything fancy but nice to get a quick bite and relax in our room, especially when it's bitter cold out. Wish checkout was noon instead of 11."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Perfect hotel for our family's visit to take in a Bluejackets game. Walking distance to the arena and lots of restaurants. Can't beat their FREE drinks and food! Will definitely stay here again!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"The room was big and comfortable. The free happy hour and food was nice. My only suggestion would be to have more of a variety for breakfast and dinner which includes more healthier options. I stayed here for three days. By the third day the same thing for breakfast was getting very boring. Also, dinner was exactly the same Monday and Wednesday. My option were further limited by my low-carb diet. It was still definitely nice and worth it for the price."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,great location. close to the sporting arenas. wifi works fine.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"We have been customers with Drury Inn for almost 10 years... Our stays have always been comfortable and we will continue to come back. I have to commend the job from your Asst. Manager Richard S., he was helpful and attentive to both us and whoever I saw him dealing with. On top of that, all the staff we encountered.., greeted us or were over polite in allowing to pass or gain access to wherever we were headed. Definitely a 5 star staff.... Next visit to Columbus, we will surely stay there again. The only issue we had was dealing with elevator wait time..., but since our legs work just fine.. I don't mind stairs. God Bless"

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Hotel staff was great! Food options were poor, especially in comparison to the Drury we first tried in St. Louis. We paid 50 a night over the Hyatt for the convince of hot breakfast which was foolish, knowing I pack my own food and my son thought the eggs were plastic like. Hot food in the evening included hot dogs and chili."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"I stayed at the drury for a convention and enjoyed every minute of my stay. Check in was easy and quick.

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"As always, Drury Inn did not disappoint. I can't think of a real negative. Price was high, but that is expected for a downtown location. Everything was clean, modern, safe, and a very short distance from the Arena we were walking to."

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,My favorite hotel in Columbus!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Great extras

Even with the commotion of people, the staff were absolutely incredible. They were very friendly, accommodating and welcoming. I wish I would have remembered the gentleman's name that checked me in but he addressed me by my... More"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Breakfast was sub-par. Hot food was barely warm, coffee was awful, they kept running out of cream, yogurt, and juice. The evening reception was equally unappetizing: the free alcoholic beverages tasted so bad they were undrinkable, and the food was disgusting, cold, and the same offerings each night. The other amenities such as the fitness center and pool were acceptable. But none of this justifies the price of nearly 185 a night."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Great place to stay if you are headed to Columbus for a show/event at Nationwide Arena...and probably the Convention Center. Very clean comfortable room and they had a complimentary beverage and snack buffet (chili, hot dogs, nachos, chicken tenders, mac'n'cheese) beginning at 5:30 pm that was a quick pre-concert meal for us. They also do am breakfast buffet. We will... More"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"My mattress had plastic covering on it. It made the worst noise anytime you rolled over on it. It also made me extremely hot and sweaty. Worst night sleep. When asked, hotel staff had no idea why my mattress was covered. The hotel itself is nice and clean and near the convention center. Food and manager's reception was a nice touch."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"I really liked this hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was especially clean. I get grossed out easily and nothing here grossed me out (I didn't even wear my flip flops in the shower). We ended up staying in two different Drury Inns over the weekend. This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,It was a good stay...have stayed there many times. The only challenge was someone smoking well into the night (3am)in a nearby room and the smoke was coming in through our ventilation system. :((

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Got lost on the way there because of construction. Called ahead because a group of friends was already there and the room was under my name. The lady at the desk gave them a parking pass and let them go on to the convention we were in town for and we arrived later to a huge clean room. The access to the convention center was great and I will definitely be staying there again next year for the same convention.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,I stayed here for 4 nights while attending a conference. The breakfast is top notch with fresh fruit and healthy cereal choices. The evening reception hot snacks are also plentiful. There is a walkway to the convention center which was great for rainy weather.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Close to downtown. Friendly staff.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"The Drury was great, as usual. The only complaint I have is that the room smelled of smoke. Since neither of us smoke AND the hotel is supposed to be completely smoke-free, that wasn't pleasant (thank goodness, we always bring a can of febreeze). Thankfully, it wasn't over-powering. They did offer to come check it out, but I was more concerned with not getting charged for smoking in the room, which is why I brought it up to the front desk staff. The breakfast is nice and the evening kickback (baked potatoes, nachos, hot dogs, soups, salad, etc.) is nice, too. It's all free and it's good. The room was comfortable and it was quite large. We had a coupon for a free upgrade, otherwise, I'm sure the room wouldn't have been nearly so large. The view of downtown Columbus was great! We took quite a few pictures as the sun was setting and the buildings were lighting up. We definitely felt safe walking around. I would stay here again."

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Better than average overall, but plan to eat elsewhere. Friendly staff and clean hotel. Bring your own shampoo/bath products because the pumps release a small drop at a time. I had to pump it over 150 times to condition my hair. That is not an exaggeration."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"I stayed here for one night in order to attend a conference at Columbus State the next day.

Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Stayed two nights the first weekend of May for a volleyball tourney at convention center. Great access vi walkway...love the offering of food for breakfast and afternoon. Customer service is tops as always and rooms were clean and comfortable. Our family prefers a Drury hotel when traveling.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Great until I was assaulted not only by other guests but hobos outside. Nothing was done to control the rule breaking guests or trespassers until after my sister and I were hurt and stay ruined. Best I got was a late check our since we were in the hospital.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,In town for a hockey game. Very convenient location. Nice breakfast and dinner selections. Clean rooms. Pool and hot tub were nice and appeared clean as well. Staff were polite and greeted us at each passing. No complaints. Recommended.
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"The experience was very good. We enjoyed our upgrade, great view of the city. The hot breakfast is a nice perk as well as the kickback time. I will definetly stay again. The Staff is very nice. Thanks Kevin!"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Great hotel. Close to arena district, short north, and downtown. Came on a Friday night and was shocked they had 3 free complimentary drinks plus free food from 5:30-7! And it was liquor, beer, or wine! Room was clean, nice, and very current. Def will stay again!"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Awesome hospitality!!! The best place in town!!! Safe and close to everything!!!
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"I stayed there two nights last week on business . I liked the fact that there was free wifi, free happy hour food, free indoor parking and free hot breakfast. I had a hard time with the wifi but the help line was helpful. Ultimately, even the computer help line could not fix an erratic wifi that kept bouncing me... More"
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"As always we stay at Drury when we are away. We are in Columbus for Blue Jackets games throughout the season and never think to go elsewhere. Quality, location,value and just the overall experience of staying here keep bringing us back."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Checking into this hotel was an absolute nightmare it took over an hour because the guy behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to use the new system and had to call the IT guy in order to check me in. There's no bar there's no food they say they have free food for gas but really it's just popcorn there's no real amenities this place is so run down joke that hasn't been updated in quite a while. I will never stay here again nor will I stay anywhere but a name brand Hotel since the staff is rude there were no amenities that I'm used to and checking it was an absolute nightmare
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,"Came here with a large group. What staff we saw was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast provided is more or less the definition of good enough. Don't come here expecting a fantastic experience, but it's a place to sleep and incredibly convenient if you have business in the convention center."
Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Wow!!! This was probably the best hotel experience I have ever had. The room was top notch and the breakfast was very good. The free evening food was a huge plus. The ease of getting to the convention center was great as well. Parking was on site and easy to access. The only negative was that we were leaving early...

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Pros: convenient location, up to date rooms, and friendly valet and front office staff. Cons: Walls are paper thin and you can hear everyone come off the elevator. The problem wasn't the hotel but the patrons. We had 2 rooms and my family and I got no sleep until 3am when the partiers are finally passed out."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Try the spa!
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"eveything was perfect , everyone was so friendly , only thing was when we got into our room there was a gift from Sugarfina , my children were so excited , we went out for dinner when we came back it was gone , the operator said because the way I booked my room we didn't qualify for the free amenity , weird that they would come in our room to take the little gift"

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Great room. Really great restaurant called Citrus. The service at Citrus was fantastic.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"great place for big events like weddings or prom. also, great service and amazing pool area overlooking santana row."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Room was not very clean, the bathroom is tiny and the beds (we had two in the room) are too small and soft. The hotel is more of a night club with some rooms that look groovy in pictures but are not really very nice. Overall, the cleanliness in the entire hotel was poor, fingerprints on walls/mirrors, many scratch and scuff marks. The breakfast was absolutely terrible, just awful."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Room was very clean. Staff was very nice. Not a bad area at all. Valet was very nice and helpful. Great place to stay.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,I have resevered two room paid in advanced one for my self and another for my guest however they after that I realized that after first night they changed the room basically after one my guest left and my other guest arrived to the hotel they made him wait till check in time for the room that supposed to be mine from day before and it was paid already.this hotel its located in nice neighborhood and they are busy anyway that's why they don't care about your complaints and the customers
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Great
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Super friendly, helpful, gracious staff!"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Stayed here for Memorial day weekend. It is a beautiful hotel inside and out. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. Their Brunch is awesome and surprisingly 4 hours long which is unusual at most hotels that offer brunch. It is usually shorter from what I have experienced. Highly recommend this place if you do not mind spending a little extra on a room. It will be worth it.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"This is a good hotel in a great location. They have a great restaurant, a bar (see my review for V Bar), an indoor terrace, an outside terrace, a pool and fitness center as well as valet parking. A lot to offer. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 3pm so we waited at the indoor terrace, which... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Really convenient location in the middle of downtown Santana Row, which reminds me of Downtown Disney without the cartoon characters. The staff is helpful. Rooms are very clean and well accessorized. The food is not good but there are plenty of places to eat on Santana Row. Looks like a resort hotel but functions like a business hotel."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Check in was fast and efficient . Room itself was beautiful but bathroom could be more modern and sleek for the price. No turn down service or any fancy 5 start perks like what I expect when staying at a luxury hotel. Your had to ask for bar key which I thought was tacky considering the environment. Not recommended for... More
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The hotel was absolutely beautiful and was right in the heart of Santana Row, which was so fun! Great Location!"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The room, room service, hotel amenities, and service were great. The breakfast was very disappointing and well below the general quality of the hotel."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,don't buy the food by the pool. it isn't worth it.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The hotel is located right on Santana Row, a very hip street with great restaurants and shopping. The hotel was better than expected, super stylish decor and furnishings, cool vibe, complimentary breakfast. Location location location. The only thing i didn't like about the hotel is that they use double beds instead of queen for their double bed rooms, pretty small for two people. If I had stayed in a king bed room, I wouldn't have noticed at all. Travelling with kids though and we were cramped. To get nit-picky, the tub/shower was more three star than five star. Other than that, a GREAT hotel, I'll be back."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,pack your adult beverages in your bags before you valet...
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,We were in town for a wedding. We already knew about the area so decided to stay here to be right on Santana Row (lots of shopping and restaurants). Great stay!
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Stay was great. Only downside was there weren't enough TV channels. Too many sports channels.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Nice room and staff was very courteous. Would stay again.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,4th floor room with two balconies!  Sweet!
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I booked through Hotels.com but when we got to the hotel, they couldn't find us in the system (even though I showed them the reservation code)... They ended up giving us a room for that night. I am upset because I didn't receive the rewards toward the free night stay because the hotel marked us as canceled. We did not cancel. They couldn't find the reservation on their end. I called them and hotels.com and they said they will call me back to solve the problem. One week later, and no one called. Upset at hotels.com and the hotel right now... not sure if I trust to book through this website again."

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Free wifi is slow and premium is charged at $10 per night (and isn't much faster). So if you own a 3/4G USB Internet dongle, be worth bringing it with you."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,I suggest they put towel hangers close to the shower
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,room was extremely dusty and surfaces were not clean. Example - there was thick gray lint around entire outlet in bathroom.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,We stayed here while visiting family in the area over Thanksgiving. The hotel is in a wonderful location for shopping and restaurants and about 15 minutes from the airport. The rooms are nice and staff is very friendly and professional. We would stay here again!

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,The hotel has a beautiful outdoor area where you can eat or just relax. The weather was very nice and sitting outside was a slice of heaven
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,don't forget to tip your bartenders
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Awful Fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am. No staff telling us it was a false alarm. Everybody evacuated. My 70 year old mother hurt herself going down the stairs. Once out, still nobody telling us it was a false alarm and safe to go back in, or that could take elevators back in. Second night, people yelling in the hallways in the middle of the night. Very little sleep either night."

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I was fortunate enough to stay here in late Oct '15. The Santana Row area is something special and I found the Hotel Valencia to be excellent, if a little pricey. My room was large and comfortable and the hotel facilities were excellent. I really enjoyed the rooftop bar as a relaxing location to have a couple of quiet drinks... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"We were given the worst rooms in the house. I believe it's because we booked through Expedia. We had a family of 7 in two rooms, both rooms were handicap versions, no tubs for kids, and located at extreme opposite ends of the hotel. They claimed it was due to being extremely full, despite booking months in advance and giving them two warnings of our arrival 24 hrs prior and morning of. Handicap rooms were totally inappropriate with small children. They made zero effort to put us close together. Do not recommend for families. Dining room is too formal, and they do not allow children in the lounge. Room service wasn't perfect. Asked for wine with 4 glasses and a bucket of ice. They brought 3 glasses and no ice. They charged a late evening service charge for room service before 8 pm. Won't return I'm afraid."

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The hotel is beautiful! Our room looked out into Santana Row we were on the 4th floor. The bed was very comfortable and clean, the mini fridge was stocked with all sorts of drinks from water to juices sodas and wine! We received a complementary bottle of wine with our stay which was pretty fantastic! Complementary water bottle once you're entering or leaving the hotel at the entrance. The next morning you get a pretty delicious breakfast buffet with your stay! They had everything from scrambled eggs to rum raisin bread pudding! All the different varieties of drinks you want such as orange juice to coffee etc. next time in the area we will definetly book our stay here."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Good location and breakfast is quite good. Mattras(bed) is too soft for us.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,It is a very nice facility . The only thing that was a bit challenging was getting to the valet through the shopping corridor.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Stayed at the Valencia for a 21st Birthday Weekend.....False Fire Alarm the First Night Which Was Interesting. Only Negative was That We Could Not Get a Roll Away in the Room. They Said Due to Fire Restrictions but There Was Plenty of Room so it Didn't Seem Correct. The Breakfasts Were Outstanding. Easter Weekend and the Weather Was Perfect. Great Spot.

I'll head up the peninsula next time."

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,This is the third and last time we will be staying here. We go there for the pool and to escape the San Francisco fog. The pool is poorly staffed. Towels are scarce and their isn't a bartender. There is one waiter for the whole pool and he doesn't take orders you have to go make a phone call to order room service and then over an hour later your food/drinks are delivered. Bad business and lost revenue.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I have stayed here a few times. On this stay I booked two rooms, one of which was a handicap access room. Not a huge deal, but it just wasn't specified when I booked the room. Everything, including the shower head, was lower. Not ideal for a tall person. Again, not a big deal but would have been nice to know. Very nice rooms and hotel overall."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The Valencia is a very nice hotel. The location is super. The staff was great. The rooms were spacious and clean.

Right in the heart of all the action -- will definitely be staying here again!"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,We were there for my granddaughter's graduation from university. I had a knee operation so having to change elevators to get from the street to our room was not easy and painful. We (a party of 6) were unable to have a drink at the rooftop bar because there was little seating for groups of more than 4 and no extra chairs to pull up. Other than that it was lovely.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,the breakfast is pretty nice and they have an amazing pool. great way to fight the jet lag.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"This gem of a boutique hotel is situated on Sanrana Row. The most perfectly clean, manicured and lovely street that you can imagine. If you like high end shopping and delish outdoor dining, this is the spot. The only drawback is the early close of the hotel bar. Pricey, but worth it if you can swing it!"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Didn't stay here but held a wonderful reception here. The food was absolutely the best and the staff was very friendly and helpful. This place reminds me a lot of La Fonda in Santa Fe. Wonderful location in San Jose in the center of shopping and dining at Santana Row.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Nice get away! hotel was great.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"The hotel room and service were good. The rooms are clean, the bed comfortable, but the tub was tiny (too small to take a bath) and dilapidated. It stood out. The problem with the hotel is the noise coming from the street. At night a guy sets up a music box on the street and attempts to sing along. The music was horrible and the sound carried into the room as if he was sitting next to me. Despite my complaining, it went on till well after 11 p.m. I was not able to sleep, read or think due to the sound. I know it is not exactly the hotel's fault, but I would of appreciated being given some information about how loud the room was going to be during the evening. I was uncomfortable in my room which made my stay not so good."

Otherwise we where made to wait more than an hour and a half for our room at check in. Hotel desk staff was not very considerate to its guest. No one kept us updated or showed any concern. All the staff says is ... More

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"This is a really excellent hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful and stylish, with very nice and large rooms. The rooftop pool is great, with tremendous views of the surrounding mountains. The hotel bar is a bit of a scene, so you will see a lot of exotic cars out front in the evening. Santana Row is a great location,... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Beautiful room. Great location. We will definitely be back soon for our frequent trips to San Jose. Continental breakfast was absolutely amazing!!!
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"For paying nearly 400 per night, I would expect a much larger room. We had two queen beds which were comfortable but they took up so much of the room. There was a long bar/counter that ran the full length of wall adjacent to the beds and it was really unnecessary because it took up so much space. The location... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I'm a San Jose local and booked a room at Hotel Valencia as a little staycation with my friends visiting from other parts of the Bay Area. It's located along Santana Row next to Valley Fair mall, so there is no shortage of shopping and chain-food options in the area. However, I would say if you have a car and... More"

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Lovely hotel with very nice room, great service, good food, with a pretty pool area that is not huge but is of adequate size. The only areas that could be improved is a larger fridge, or one that is not completely stocked so there is room to put your own things, more or larger drawers for clothes, and more hooks in the bathroom for towels and/or wet bathing suits."
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Don't buy the food by the pool. It isn't worth it.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Stayed here for 1N on business and it was in an absolutely lovely area. There is HM just opposite and the hotel is located within rows of restaurants/shops. If you'd like to buy groceries, there's also just Safeway/CVS about 5 min walk away, near the Cheesecake Factory (awesome strawberry cheesecake). The hotel itself is very spacious and clean, with an... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,The breakfast is pretty nice and they have an amazing pool. Great way to fight the jet lag.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Awesome hotel - V bar is THE bar in town
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Not so sure about the reviews regarding not being a quiet hotel. The staff will accommodate you with a room with views of the inner courtyard. Stayed there for 5 days and it was the best 5 nights I've ever had in San Jose. Santana Row is also the place to be for fashion shops and nightlife if you want.... More
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,The hotel was a great value. The biggest problem we had was that we didn't get access to our room until almost 6pm because house keeping was running behind and all we received was a free drink in the hotel bar. It was really frustrating.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I have stayed at Hotel Valencia numerous times for a quick get away, even though I live only 20 minutes away.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Valencia hotel is all you can imagine and more. It is on the prime location, offers easy parking ( valet or self-parking) and variety of entertainment.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I particularly liked Hotel Valencia because I noticed it's on higher floors so the rooms get exceptional sunlight.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I've stayed two nights for a business trip at this hotel. Staff is very friendly and the room was spacious, clean and well decorated.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Very clean and modern hotel close to food and shopping. Very good breakfast in the morning.
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"Excellent location, nice room, free wi-fi and a huge parking garage with free (for hotel guests) self-parking just a block away. Nice pool/Jacuzzi area. A couple things to be aware of: You have to take an elevator up to 3rd floor, walk across the lobby, and take another elevator to get to guest rooms. There is only one rather small... More"
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,Nice hotel but rooms are dark
Hotel Valencia Santana Row,"I love this Hotel, it is in the perfect spot for shopping, eating, strolling, and drinking. What could be better.

Hotel Valencia Santana Row,I stayed in the hotel for business so didn't get time to make use of the rooftop pool - but at least I could look out at it from my 7th floor room on the opposite side of the central courtyard. The room was large enough and nicely laid out. The free WiFi seemed pretty good. Breakfast (included in the... More

Quality Inn and Suites,Parking garage dark and spooky. Hotel is older and in need of updating. Elevators are scary! Room was ok for an overnight stay but wouldn't want to spend extended time there. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and this was a definite plus. I would recommend this hotel if you are in need of a reasonable rate for... More
Quality Inn and Suites,"The price was very good and staff was friendly. However they need to update the halls, rooms and beds. My wife started complaining about her allergies from the smell in the room. She thought there might be mold. I felt the bed was just O.K. but she found it uncomfortable. The remote was missing the back cover."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Got a good price on Expedia because hotel is renovating Had to walk past the dehumidifiers broken ceiling tiles Room itself is good size, comfy king size bed WIFI is spotty Breakfast had scrambled eggs, pour your own waffles, bread items, coffee Exercise room not good Pool needs to be cleande upgraded"
Quality Inn and Suites,"The good: The staff here is very kind and accommodating. I found them always ready to be of assistance, always saying hello, especially in the breakfast area. There is ample covered parking. The rooms themselves appear to have been renovated with new furniture (microwave, fridge, new lighting) and a new bed, which was very comfortable. Unfortunately, nothing was done to... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"This is a very old building in dire need of renovation. Many other reviewers give this place a lot of credit for having been freshly spruced up, but I think they're overselling it. The room I was in had been freshly painted, and the bed bedding was new and clean and comfortable, but all of these superficial improvements don't... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"We stayed here overnight. The Good: Friendly staff, Great price (AAA member), Pet friendly, Free Parking The Bad: Badly in need of a makeover. Stale,musty odors in carpeted areas. Not so fresh smelling linen....and the creepiest elevators outside of a horror movie! I have it a 3 primarily due to the welcoming staff and hot breakfast."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Nice location, easy access to and around. Sufficient and convenient parking. Helpful, polite, and professional staff. Very tired and worn throughout - lobby, hallways, rooms. Elevators are old, slow, and small. Cleanliness is ok, but could be better."
Quality Inn and Suites,"This hotel is hard to find from the south due to the terrain. Room, beds and shower were excellent, but the walls are so paper-thin that you are tempted to join in the conversation in the next room. pets are accepted, but there is no designated area to walk pets."
Quality Inn and Suites,"The employees were extremely nice at this Comfort Inn. I would give the employees a rating of five out of five. The building is another story, and that's why I give this place an overall rating of three out of five. The building seems very old and is somewhat threadbare. When I walked in, I noticed an unpleasant odor. Perhaps... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"On booking this hotel I wasn't expecting much how wrong I was. Check in nice and easy the guy on reception was great very helpful. The room was of a great size the bathroom also, the bed was very comfortable which made for a great nights sleep. Once we had settled into the room we got a call from the... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"We are regulars at Quality inn and never disappointed. This location just converted or taken over from another brand. We arrived after dark, no signage, and the one that was there was upside down. Very dark and very dimly lit parking area. Not the best (to say the least) neighborhood. Upon entering the very pleasant desk person had a surgical... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"We were pleased that our disabled room was large enough for us to get around in, that the shower was roll-in, and that the shower and commode had good grab bars. There was plenty of on-site free parking, and a hot breakfast was included. Staff was friendly, All that caused me to consider a rating of very good. But we... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,If you are looking for a cheap place to stay this is it. There is nothing fancy about the place. They tried to renovate but only updated some bedding and the bathroom sink. My pillowcases were yellow and there was a burn hole in the comforter in a non-smoking room. The mattress was not comfortable at all. Take the stairs... More
Quality Inn and Suites,"I stayed just one night during the World Cycling Championships. It is not the Ritz Carlton, but if you are budget conscious and are looking for a reasonably-priced hotel and don't have great expectations, this could be a good selection. The room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast is included. There is plenty of parking. However, the hotel is not in... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"The front desk staff of Stephanie, Kathy and Matt were absolutely wonderful attending to our needs. Kathy got us a room for an extra night and was so helpful with the rates. Room was clean and comfortable. Very close to town so we were able to walk around. Highly recommend this hotel."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Though the installations are a bit worn out, the hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly. Free parking and a great location was also very appreciated. We got a room for four people, with a small fridge, a microwave oven and an iron, which was exactly what we needed in our long stay with small kids. Also, there... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"This hotel is bad, really, really bad. Just when you thought that this place could not get worse it does. We selected the hotel because of the location and the Comfort Inn Brand. We should have left but tried sticking it out for a night. First the elevator (see other reviews) is terrifying... it looks like the elevator in a... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"This hotel has an interesting layout. a covered parking garage with a second level that has an old swimming pool. There is tons of potential for that second level. Anyway, the hotel was nice enough and clean. Hotel staff were very helpful and polite."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Adequate service. The place is a bit dingy and in need of a good sprucing up. Elevator felt rickety and was banged up on the inside. I had a smoking room and it didn't stink like I thought it would. Vanity and shower had lots of cracks and bruises. But at least things seemed clean. Low, tiled ceilings feel very... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Stayed here for 4 nights 2 weeks ago. I was first given room 428.

Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel is ok, but the beds are horrible, they are not leveled so you will most likely have a backache. The lifts are not smart so make sure you press the right button otherwise it will follow the pushing order and not the floor order and you might end up going from bottom to fifth even though you are... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Not bad for the price, I booked hotel under employee rate. Over all i can give 4 star to this hotel for good breakfast, excellent customer service. Staff did good job both days we were there. Over all i can give A to this hotel."
Quality Inn and Suites,"To look at some of the amenities of the Comfort Inn, one would think the hotel had not upgraded since the mid-90s. The elevators are very small, the pool was empty and looked as if it was unused for a year or more. I stayed on the fifth floor in what was supposed to be a non-smoking room, but the... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"I've been there two times in few days dated furnitures, unstable free wifi , poor free breakfast, not really clean in the common areas, rooms were instead fine. It's far from downtown, around 20 minutes with the bus (don't rely on their schedules). Despite all, it's quiet (maybe I've been lucky) and finally a good place at a convenient price."
Quality Inn and Suites,"This hotel hasn't enjoyed the best of reviews on Trip Advisor but I fail to understand why. The place is easy to find and has adequate undercover free parking. OK the place looks a little dated but I have to remind myself I paid under US90. The reception was very professional and friendly, the room was large and had all... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Room and hotel are just ok, beds are very small and old. it really could use upgrades. bathroom is fairly newer but still could use an upgrade. the blankets and sheets need to upgraded. Location is good and the lobby is fairly new."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I was very disappointed when I checked into this hotel. I was in Richmond to attend the Jazz Festival and have had great experiences at Comfort Inn hotels in the past. This was unlike any other. I was given a smoking room because according to the clerk, I had booked on-line directly with Comfort Inn. Wouldn't this make my options... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,This hotel is in an area of Richmond that is less than desirable. We booked it because it wasn't far from Richmond airport where we arrived late evening and didn't want to travel far our first night in Virginia. Waited at front desk for 15 minutes before someone showed up to check us in. The price was right and the... More
Quality Inn and Suites,We spent one night in this hotel and were satisfied. Big room and very comfortable beds. Clean and renovated bathroom. We checked in around midnight and the fron desk made it very quick. Not a place to walk around late in the night but a very good one for a stay.
Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel itself is a dump. Huge, but very old and dated. It was probablly really nice back in the day. Seems to be kind of near a not so great area of the city. The room itself was actually nice, updated well. It was very pet friendly but I would not stay here again unless I had my dog... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,Had stayed here two years ago and forgotten I had said never again. The staff is wonderful and very nice but that's where it ends. This hotel is dated and filthy it reminds you of a grade b movie but dirtier they were having a function and my floor was vibrating until 11:15 even though they said 11. Not that... More
Quality Inn and Suites,"Very old building, needs much attention. Non smoking floor reeked of smoke. I kept waiting for the ceiling tile in shower to fall on me. I didn't bother with breakfast because I honestly didn't think the kitchen would be any cleaner. When I checked in, I had to clean the toilet seat myself (I'll spare ya the specifics)."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I was a little intimidated when I saw the outside and then the parking, but I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel itself. Quite clean and the staff are super friendly. The breakfast room is very nice and it is central to most things in Richmond. If you're looking at traveling on a budget, don't miss this gem!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel was nice enough its been taken over by choice hotels and they have upgraded the rooms so they are okay, the breakfast is good. Its located in a commercial area, so the area is so so. My only complaint is that its a party place, I'm here working and have to get up every day at 5am, and... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,"I booked 4 rooms for 1 night. Pros: Location, while sketchy, is convenient to VCU and museums. Public areas are nice and the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful. Cons: Parking garage is dirty and dark. Elevators are tiny, slow, and shabby. The halls and sleeping rooms desperately need renovating. Bedding needs replacement. Drapes are filthy and shabby....

Quality Inn and Suites,Older hotel but clean room with clean bathroom and luxurious linens. Staff was super nice (Matt upon check in). Morning staff all said good morning. The Breakfast station did not have a microwave to re-heat coffee. Coffee was OFF THE HOOK GOOOOOD! No packets of hot chocolate available . Bananas were DARK GREEN How ya gonna eat that Second... More
Quality Inn and Suites,"Great staff, friendly and efficient. Hallway had an odd smell, that would be my only complaint but I would definitely stay there again."
Quality Inn and Suites,"The staff were outstanding! Truly a 5 star staff! As for the hotel itself, it is obvious that it's an old hotel. And in need of updating. (New carpet, some minor wall damage throughout hallways, etc.) But it is also obvious that said changes are taking place. A new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor, etc. This was my 1st art show in Richmond, and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue. Which made it so much easier to get well rested and be at my best. The morning breakfast was wonderful as well. But I must say, the staff at this location ARE 5 star! After the upgrades, I fully expect this hotel to have a 5 start rating! I just hope they continue to be as reasonable with their rates!"
Quality Inn and Suites,the stay was ok the elevators were both down at the time rooms were very clean we were in very convient location
Quality Inn and Suites,It was ok.
Quality Inn and Suites,"Hotel is a good value for what you need it for. Beds are good, showers work good. Conditions inside the hotel could use some updates. it has a few under used items fitness room that could be converted into a better laundry room and better used."
Quality Inn and Suites,Pretty good
Quality Inn and Suites,pretty nice AC has stopped working other than that have a nice night
Quality Inn and Suites,The hotel was good for an overnight.
Quality Inn and Suites,Awesome
Quality Inn and Suites,This was not the best experience The front desk staff was great.
Quality Inn and Suites,"This is a low cost, low amenity place in rougher area - passable for a night or two. Wi-Fi was OK in room, but not secure. Free breakfast was good with hot and cold choices. Elevators - 1 not working long term, other was barely working, and was vvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyy ssssslllllooooowwwww. Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's. Who smokes anymore The rooms are fairly beat up, small beds, small no frill bath, no water pressure. Did have med size fridge and microwave tho."
Quality Inn and Suites,This hotel is old and in a very industrial area.
Quality Inn and Suites,Hotel was in worse condition than just a month ago. One elevator broken. Other very sketchy. Would not stay there again.
Quality Inn and Suites,Didnt feel comftable wasnt satisfy no breakfast kitchen was flood.no hot water dirty towels.stans in rags smh.beds was woring down.refrigrator didnt work.funny smell to room.
Quality Inn and Suites,"No Hot Water, there was a smell to the room the bathroom could have been much cleaner."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Staff was great.hotel really outdated.breakfast great. Room to small bathroom,TV .ANd cleaness awful because we found sunflower seeds everywhere and a banana peel under the bed. So someone not doing there job."
Quality Inn and Suites,"We had three rooms for me and family members the night before running in a Richmond 10K race. This was a mile from the start line, but other places were full or event-priced. Rooms here were ancient-feeling with badly stained carpets, trickle of shower water in the morning, bedding that felt creepy-crawly (although no one reported actually seeing bugs). My daughter's room was subjected to loud noise from neighboring misbehaving guests until 3 am. The desk clerk on Saturday morning seemed overwhelmed by guest issues/complaints. For slightly more money, we have stayed in much better budget hotel rooms in this part of Richmond."
Quality Inn and Suites,I do not recommend any family stay at this hotel unless you want to experience bed bugs and a filthy bathtub. Friends and I were in town for a wedding and want to save anyone in the future for having such a poor experience. No amount of savings is worth dealing with such poor cleanliness. Dirty sheets and black and brown bath tubs await you. O
Quality Inn and Suites,"Not worth 95 dollars at all , a mess .. Small dirty elevators . the front desk person was heavenly though , so nice ."
Quality Inn and Suites,I stayed here for the River Rock weekend. I just needed somewhere to sleep that wasn't directly downtown pricing. The staff was nice and the hotel was pretty quite even though it's next to a main street.
Quality Inn and Suites,"This is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint. I mostly booked this hotel because it is the cheapest in town. The rooms are not bad but the bath tub water will be brown with rust for the first few seconds when you turn it on. Both elevators are also old and need to be replaced. They are slow, falling apart, creaky and honestly a little scary. The hotel staff is nice though and they have free breakfast. They breakfast is not the best (bananas that are both green and black, small pastries, cereal dispensers that don't work, reconstituted coffee) but it is free."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Staff was very friendly. Hotel was quite, clean, and comfortable. I little dated, but nice. Will stay there again."
Quality Inn and Suites,odor in room
Quality Inn and Suites,Decent neighborhood. Older building in the middle of a remodel. Lobby and staff were nice. Room was super clean with an effort being made to update.
Quality Inn and Suites,"wifi very very slow.,.almost nothing..."
Quality Inn and Suites,Close to RIR!! Scary Neighborhood!!
Quality Inn and Suites,The hotel needs major work the room was nasty even stains on curtains do not believe these photos at all . I'll never go back !
Quality Inn and Suites,"We stayed one night. The room was clean, but the rest of the hotel badly needs renovation (hallways with dirty wallpaper, the elevator in very bad condition, it was vibrating and it was scary to ride). The parking lot didn't look too safe"
Quality Inn and Suites,great will stay again
Quality Inn and Suites,The bathroom was small but adequate. couldn't have more than one person at a time
Quality Inn and Suites,"The room had 3 lamps that didn't work, cigarette burns in multiple places, and an terrible view or the city."
Quality Inn and Suites,The room was fine the room and clean the breakfast was good but the biggest issue I had was they double charged my credit card and I had a scheduled payment due to come out and I was short due to their incompetence
Quality Inn and Suites,"Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2."
Quality Inn and Suites,Full breakfast every morning. Coffee and tea always in the lobby. TV in small gym. Daily housekeeping. Friendly staff. I saw ballpark fireworks one night from the picture window by the elevator. :)
Quality Inn and Suites,"needed a place to stay while on a long trip (16 hr). Happy to find a place which was clean, comfortable, convenient, with great service."
Quality Inn and Suites,"This was the worst experience I have ever had in my life. The room was filthy, the toilet bowl was so filthy that I went to a restaurant to use the facilities!!! I wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower!!! Since this website will not let me say what I really think ( Says my review has inappropriate language, even though there is not I curse word in it.) I guess the truth isn't what they really want to hear!!!! Let's just say this hotel rents rooms to FARM ANIMALS that will keep you up until the break of dawn!!!!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"This is an old downtown Hotel. I need a secure quiet place to sleep in on my long drive to NC. It fits the bill perfectly. Check in was quick and cordial. The elevator was old and worn but in good repair and worked fine it was probably slow and shaky at the time it was built. No problem for me. Room was clean and quiet, with worn furnishings, upgraded tight but functional bathroom, firm bed. I arrived late left early."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times, back when it was a Comfort Inn and now as a Quality Inn. It's reliable, affordable and generally I have always been happy when I have stayed here. The free hot breakfast is a nice touch and staff is generally accommodating and helpful. This time however, it seems that the air conditioning was not working in my room, something I wasn't aware of until I finally retired for the evening. Despite setting the thermostat to 60 and the function to cool, it was hot, humid and made it very difficult to sleep comfortably. It was late at night when I turned in, so I bit the bullet because I didn't feel like packing up and moving to another room in the middle of the night. Maybe this was just a malfunction of the A/C in my room and the rest of the rooms are fine, but I would check when you arrive to ensure that you didn't have the same experience that I did. Having said that, I have had enough positive experiences here in the past that it would not stop me from staying here again."
Quality Inn and Suites,super ugly I have stained on quality inns hotels for years and nothing like this one this is super dirty hotel elevators don't work tubs are dirty floors are dirty toilets devastating
Quality Inn and Suites,Pleasant
Quality Inn and Suites,"It is situated right downtown so a pretty tough area.One elevator was broke down-the other had no permit hanging would take 5+ minutes to come if it even came.It creaked and the door would barely close.It would also take you to the basement no matter what button you pushed.We finally used the stairs.The pool is on second level along with an old parking lot room windows(which can open) There would be food broken glass and even broken pieces of the building that you would have to walk through to go to the pool or get in the building(even though those 3 doors were broken and wouldn't let you in with your key) The pool was dirty-DIRTY.There was dirt and mold all around the walking area.The inside wall of the pool was black. The gym had no air at all,a broken treadmill weights 20lbs over. Room was TINY. There was also the smell of marijuana on the 5th floor and partying in resulted in someone pulling the fire alarm at midnight and we had to be evacuated. No one from the front desk ever came to use someone staying here said we could come in. Its not worth the price.You can get a much better hotel at the same rate. The staff was amazing which was sad that management has let this hotel run down."
Quality Inn and Suites,Rooms much nicer than the lobby and hallways. The breakfast and facility was excellent. The air conditioning is outdated and ineffective
Quality Inn and Suites,The hotel was pretty shabby. Elevator didn't work. Someone was running up and down the halls above my room all night. Breakfast not great.
Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel is poorly maintained, common areas like elevators were unkept, the breakfast was poor and in a bad location, and there was an infestation of bedbugs. The manager refused to talk to us even after two calls."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Great hotel for the money! We are cheap, but fussy - If you want to stay in the Waldorf then go there - but if you want a clean, quiet room at a great low price -stay here!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel was very run down. Air vent in bathroom was full mold. Water marks in ceiling. Stains and wrinkles on bed spread, when tub faucet was turned on the water came out reddish color for a few seconds."
Quality Inn and Suites,Hotel front office associate is very helpful. The room was average . They provide free breakfast and wifi. Overall experience is good.
Quality Inn and Suites,I checked in and went to the rooms only to sit down long enough to find another hotel. The smell was old and as if there was mildew present. The carpet was worn and smelled bad. There were stains on the ceiling tiles and plaster missing and falling off the walls in spots. The elevator was only large enough for 1 person and a suitcase. I didn't feel safe for myself or my automobile. As I said earlier I left for another hotel. This hotel does not meet the criteria not represent Hotwire. It's rated 2.5 but is clearly a 1. I was too upset and pressed to get out of there I didn't stop to take pictures.
Quality Inn and Suites,"Hotel was quite and clean. Room, frig., microwave and updated bathroom were clean. Super soft pillows on the bed. My room had a stale smell, bring scented candles."
Quality Inn and Suites,"This may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now. The outside looks rundown, the sign was missing and the parking was in the rear under the second floor where the pool was. A little scary considering the neighborhood. When checking in there was a family group in the lobby, one of the men was wearing a T shirt that said What the F**k. The room was clean and some renovations were done lately. The breakfast was nice as was the area. In the morning of checkout there was what seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby from the time I came down for breakfast at 7am and was still there when we checked out at 10am."
Quality Inn and Suites,room was in really good condition looks like it has under gone a recent renovation. the only issue was I put the key card in the wrong room door and the door opened.. went in went to bed then at 11 o'clock a man tried to enter the room saying it was his room..I tried to call the front desk but the phone did not have a cord to to the wall jack. I was able to reach the desk and asked them to let us stay in the room as we were settled in and give the other gentleman another room which they did. they next day i told the lady at the front desk of the situation and she went out of her way to say how sorry she was and was sending maintenance right away..all wells that ends well..really enjoyed the breakfast all the other guests were very friendly.
Quality Inn and Suites,We will stay here again. Meets our needs and is affordable and clean.
Quality Inn and Suites,"Super outdated hotel. Especially the rooms. Clean, but old, old, old. The carpet was coming away from the the wall, old curtains, and old elevator. The carpet was really the worst thing. The elevator did not work properly. Made everything feel dingy. Tiny bathrooms.....I mean tiny! The lobby is the only thing that felt decently up to date. Breakfast and staff were all great."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I am a person that reads reviews but I have never written one before. However, after staying here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion. I was very disappointed with this hotel true it is an older hotel but major repairs are needed starting with the 2 elevators which one has an out of order sign on.. anytime you try to go to the first floor it automatically takes you to the basement then brings you back up. The basement looks scary and filthy if I had the opportunity to see the basement first i know i would never have stayed at this hotel. This is first time I ever felt unsafe at a hotel. The parking deck area needs better lighting to dark. My room was on the 4th floor the hallway smells maybe the carpet needs shampooing or just needs new carpet. The room was clean but bed was very lumpy new mattress needed ...shower pressure was horrible at anytime of the day really horrible ...the free breakfast i woulnt dare eat it do to the lack of upkeep of the facility hotel was...I can't comment on the staff I only saw the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time.....Otherwise, if the above things dont really bother you then the hotel does offer you a quiet room ....great location (it may not look like it from your hotel window but you're really close to a lot of things) ...good rates...sorry I didn't mean to write a book just wanted to give an honest opinion of my experience. ..."
Quality Inn and Suites,The elevator wasn't working the first night and I had the choice of 4the or 5th floor. The fitness center only consist of an eliptical and a treadmil. I chose this hotel because it had a rating of a 3/5. But it definitely deserves a 2/5.
Quality Inn and Suites,This hotel needs work. It was very bad
Quality Inn and Suites,One can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for the money. We had a reasonable rate and stayed here. The hotel is on a central street within a few miles of downtown Richmond. It is not located at a great neighborhood. The general condition of the hotel and the rooms is fair.
Quality Inn and Suites,The hotel is disgusting the elevators were disgusting the bathrooms were disgusting it was very loud and the hallway smell bad
Quality Inn and Suites,"Hotel is in generally poor condition. One of the two elevators out of commission, other elevator slow and unpredictable. Matt at the front desk was very helpful in rearranging room reservation and getting two rooms next to one another. Matt was very helpful when we were locked out of our room."
Quality Inn and Suites,Toilet seat broken iron board but no iron. Breakfast needs to be revisted by management
Quality Inn and Suites,"Nice, shiny floors in lobby. Parking area was a bit run down. Elevator was a little sketchy. Room was huge but bathroom was very small. Free breakfast was good. Bathroom on main floor very clean. Overall, room served its purpose for good rest and shower. Nothing else to say Blah blah blah blah blah a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a I a I a I a I a is a"
Quality Inn and Suites,"We left as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel. It was dirty, and not well maintained. I did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids. Do yourself a favor and stay outside of the city, not downtown!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Although the hotel and its rooms are not brand new, they are well maintained. Good beds. The only thing I didn't like is that the walls are rather thin. If you are unlucky, your neighbors snore or make other noises (which bugs me)."
Quality Inn and Suites,"My stay was great. The hotel is nice and in a very nice location near the Richmond Convention Center and other important businesses. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Everything I needed was available the room even had a microwave and refrigerator. If by chance I may need to visit Richmond, VA again I would like to return to this hotel for another stay."
Quality Inn and Suites,"The hotel is in need of a good update in the general areas. I thought it was out of business when I first pulled up to it, but it was the wrong door. Although the rooms were clean, expectations should be set on how old the lobby, elevators and halls are."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Room ok. Was not cleaned 100. Sadly, no bell carts available. Room was 4th floor on very end of hall. Very long hall/haul with no cart..3 trips to car to get all unloaded. Hotel needs updated/renovation."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Very dirty room, sheets, elevator and hallways. Do not go in the pool. It's filthy."
Quality Inn and Suites,Bad Neighborhood Room smelled small bathroom poor condition of beds
Quality Inn and Suites,The elevators were old and rickety and broke down Saturday morning. The steps were dark and smelled of stale cigarettes. There were homeless people.crashing in the lobby. It looks like Richmond houses people there. The parking garage was dark and obstructed from view if hotel. The iron steps in garage are old and rusty and wobbly. The hotel is being renovated . it has an outdated appearance and cheap fixes. For the price it's okay.it's in a rough neighborhood-inner-city Richmond. The breakfast was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast.
Quality Inn and Suites,Elevator was horrible. Pool was dirty. Breakfast was not good standard
Quality Inn and Suites,It was horrible. Mirror had black stuff all over it. No fridge and no sleep because of the train.
Quality Inn and Suites,The rooms were clean and the beds were soft. New shower curtains and new shower head. The hotel could use some upkeep but was a pleasant stay. My one complaint would be that the coffe pot leaked all over the counter.
Quality Inn and Suites,if u need to stay anywhere near this area...this hotel is the best one there is!!!
Quality Inn and Suites,"This hotel was great for the price! Our room was very clean. Yes, we heard one train, but that was it. This was a perfect location for us, close to the interstate. Breakfast was good for the low price of the room."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. However, the amenities in the hotel...i.e. microwaves and refrigerators need to be in every room. More closet space would help also."
Quality Inn and Suites,My room was very clean and I enjoyed the friendly employees at this location.
Quality Inn and Suites,It took over 30 mins to check. There was no remote for my tv and they never got me one room had an odor. Mangement did not seem to care about my situation will never stay there again.
Quality Inn and Suites,The staff was great. Room was clean ( a little heavy on air freshener). The only thing louder than the shower head / water pipes was the occasional train that rolled by.
Quality Inn and Suites,"Staff was friendly, rooms were clean. Pool was Great! Breakfast and Happy hour was very good! Beds were comfortable. Over all Great!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Just passing thru, but it was nice to stay in a nice, clean hotel and not have to worry about anything."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Desk clerk was courteous and helpful,beds were very comfortable the only downside was we were placed next to a connecting room and the person was on the phone talking very loud very early in the morning"
Quality Inn and Suites,We 3 ladies had a safe trip . hotel was very best and clean breakfast and the little lady were wonderful. Young man on night shift was so sweet . would stay again
Quality Inn and Suites,"We were traveling to KS from south LA and stopped in Shreveport. It was late, and the checkin was slow due to computer issues but the clerk was nice and was able to confirm the reservation. The room was clean but there were no towels or soap and we waited at the front desk a bit while the night clerk searched for requested items. There were lots of the standard breakfast offerings and the coffee was good. For the price, it was an acceptable hotel."
Quality Inn and Suites,the room was great for relaxation and the room was very clean
Quality Inn and Suites,"My overall stay was good. However this hotel I can tell was bought by Quality Inn and Suites but not updated. The service was great. The room was clean. The room was very outdated. This was a last minute stay so I can not complain,"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Stay was fine, however hotels.com forgot to reserve my room, pouring me in line twice, and 45 minutes behind schedule"
Quality Inn and Suites,The room smelled musty and the phone and clock dud not work. If you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud it would wake everyone in the room. Breakfast was advertised as 7 to 10 and we went down at about 8:30 and they were just starting to set up for breakfast
Quality Inn and Suites,Everyone was friendly and very helpful. Computers were on the blink and they kept on working manualy.
Quality Inn and Suites,I really enjoy my stay the room was so nice the beds was nice I slept like a baby the sheets was fresh and clean I will be staying there again
Quality Inn and Suites,faucets were loose in the bathroom. The battery went dead in the door lock it took almost an hour before anyone showed up who was able to get us back into our room.
Quality Inn and Suites,"The receptionist was not very personnable. It was like I was intruding on her day to ask questions of her, she never smiled or gave the impression that she was interested in our stay. The hotel was nice and close to the things we were involved in, but I am not sure we will be back at this particular motel."
Quality Inn and Suites,"OK, they shut down the breakfast service too early, though."
Quality Inn and Suites,it was good
Quality Inn and Suites,Great
Quality Inn and Suites,"Great stop over. Buffet breakfast, pool, gym and free wifi are our requirements and they were all great. But it is right next to the train tracks and it is loud and shakes the building. I slept with earplugs and was fine. The staff was super friendly!"
Quality Inn and Suites,"Room was comfortable, breakfast was lousy."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I had a brief overnight stay here on the way back home. The hotel itself was fine, but somebody tried to break into my room the next morning around 10am while I was still sleeping! Is the area really that bad that somebody would try to do that in broad daylight"
Quality Inn and Suites,"The breakfast was good, but the hotel was not clean and the floor were uneven and needed repairs. The entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache."
Quality Inn and Suites,some of the nicest people around!!!
Quality Inn and Suites,STAY AT THIS MOTEL WHILE IN TOWN FOR BUSINESS GREAT PLACE TO STAY
Quality Inn and Suites,"When we arrived we were able to check in early, which was really nice after such a long drive. The refreshments and company was nice in the evening. Breakfast was nice and hot. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Quality Inn and Suites,Realize that there are train tracks very close to the hotel. The train woke me up at 4 am with it's horn blaring.
Quality Inn and Suites,"We came for a Youth Bowling Tournament. It was close to the Bowling Alley. The breakfast was good, room was nice. My son enjoyed the pool after he bowled."
Quality Inn and Suites,This hotel was very clean and comfortable. Clean being my most important criteria for a motel room.
Quality Inn and Suites,Friendly staff
Quality Inn and Suites,Have stayed here several times. The hotel is in need of renovation. Rooms are old and as are the mattresses. Friendly staff. Breakfast food was cold and the eggs and sausage and biscuits needed to be heated up in the microwave. Very convenient to Barksdale AFB and shopping and restaurants and casinos. Decent value for the money.
Quality Inn and Suites,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
Quality Inn and Suites,Great visit. Very comfortable. Very convenient to all of our planned visits on this trip.
Quality Inn and Suites,I stayed here for business and chose this location because it is 100 ft from an Outback. I met a co worker at the hotel and had a 1 hour meeting before walking across the parking lot for dinner at Outback. Its an older hotel and needs updating but the room was well priced and the staff friendly and the... More
Quality Inn and Suites,it was okay for one night. hallway smelled of cigarette smoke. large trucks took up multiple parking spaces near entrance.
Quality Inn and Suites,After returning home my son was charged 150.00. After calling and telling him they would not speech to him and talking to management he was told they would not do anything about it and would not speech to him. This is a rip off!!! I would recommend no one to check into this MOTEL. I guess our next thing to... More
Quality Inn and Suites,Pretty good- just there for a family reunion- Coffee was cold at breakfast - no coffee in room the second nite- filter in bathroom was dirty.
Quality Inn and Suites,"I stay at this Quality Inn several times a year. Consistently good service, clean comfortable rooms and a pretty good free hot breakfast. Location is right off I-20 but you have to turn on a couple of dife streets. Wouldn't stay anywhere else (unless they were booked up)."
Quality Inn and Suites,it was nice I enjoyed the stay.
Quality Inn and Suites,"The stay was wonderful, hotel rooms clean. However, we were charged both by the hotel and hotels.com and despite repeated calls to clarify the issue, neither refunded us. We ended up paying double the amount due to something that could have been corrected by one of those organizations. We were disappointed that despite repeated calls to the hotel to address the charge, no one returned our call out of courtesy. We liked the hotel but will not return or recommend to anyone due to the double fee, that was not our fault. We were told that the manager will return the following week and resolve the issue, but we never got a call."
Quality Inn and Suites,ask for nathan and you might get a discount on your room!
Quality Inn and Suites,Me and a friend Saturday over night we have bites all over you may want to check for bed buds
Quality Inn and Suites,"My best friend and I stayed for the Garth Brooks concert that weekend. Although there were a lot of people checking in, the service was quick and courteous. The location from the hotel to the Centurylink was very convenient. we enjoyed our stay and will return if another concert comes through Bossier City. Thanks!!"
Quality Inn and Suites,The staff was extremely helpful. the first room that we saw had problems and they were very happy to put us in a room that was very nice. The beds are wonderful. I usually have problems sleeping in a strange place but the beds were so comfortable that I slept like a rock
Quality Inn and Suites,Check in was horrible the lady didn't know how to run my debit card so I had to use the hotel atm to get money to pay for my room. And cleaning staff turned the heat on when they cleaned it was over 100 out side
Quality Inn and Suites,We arrived around 9 p.m without a reservation. We were in town visiting family in the hospital. We were tired and the Outback next door was convenient for a late and quick dinner. Rates were reasonable. Our room was clean and the staff was accommodating. Just what we were looking for!
Quality Inn and Suites,"Made reservation on a spur of a moment. Hotel was okay, lady serving breakfast was super sweet. Price was reasonable."
Quality Inn and Suites,Room smelled. Very small. Bad choice on my part. Won't be making that mistake again.
Quality Inn and Suites,"stayed new years eve, as for room, was clean, beds comfy. we didnt get up for the breakfast, so not sure how it was, for the money it was overall very good. wasnt a 5 star vegas strip hotel, but neither was the price. liked the fact that it was inside acess to room.(hotel vs motel)i would stay here again no question. only a short trip to casinos. (less than a mile)"
Quality Inn and Suites,Staff was very helpful.
Quality Inn and Suites,"When making reservations, I requested a first floor room. When we arrived we were assigned to the second floor. No explanation although a first floor number was noted on card. Hotel is close to railroad tracks. We were awoken 3 times during the night. I can say employees were extremely kind. No complaints there. Breakfast was adequate."
Quality Inn and Suites,"A combination of factors made this stay less than what we had anticipated. There were weird, wrinkled curtains in our room, a rock hard bed, and at breakfast, items ran out and were not replenished even though it was still supposed to be open."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I consider this a low to medium priced hotel. No matter what the cost, I always expect cleanliness. Black mold around the tub is not acceptable. A shower head that leaks significantly when running bath water is not acceptable. We had to change rooms because our water heater was not functioning properly. The staff was very accommodating on this issue. In the end, however, I cannot say my visit was anywhere near satisfactory because of the issues in the bathroom of the room we did stay in."
Quality Inn and Suites,"Friendly, clean, conveinant. Only complains: arrived in town around noon... Couldn't check in til 3:45, And noisy train close by."
Quality Inn and Suites,only overnight but very nice and I would recommend it to friends and I would stay there again.
Quality Inn and Suites,"The first room had a noxious smell, the carpet was wet, so we change it. The second room had a din loud sound, the AC unit fan was not working, so we change it again. The third room was little stinky but we decided to stay, we were tired of the trip and from moving. The price was pretty high around 75, I could pay that for much better hotel."
Quality Inn and Suites,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past two or three years. It is a clean, well-kept property that is conveniently located. The staff is always helpful and accommodating. It is a good value for the price, too."
Quality Inn and Suites,Hair in the shower and when ask for extra towels the clerk said they were completely out
Quality Inn and Suites,The only real problem encountered was the wifi would not stay up and useable. It was very erratic.
Quality Inn and Suites,"very comfortable, huge bed, quiet, and a big tv!"
Quality Inn and Suites,Great location. Beds could have been better. But overall a good stay
Quality Inn and Suites,Lady at desk nice but had to apologize that the hotel had no more clean towels and hair was left in shower
Quality Inn and Suites,"No TV scroll to see what's on each half hour and the 4:45 am train blowing awaking all. There were no more until about 6am but the track is very close to the motel. Great friendly staff, clean fresh rooms."
Quality Inn and Suites,"It needs new carpeting because alot of it is stained and some spots felt sticky. The bathroom needs renovated. It has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners, the AC didn't get very cold. It all together needs a make over."
Quality Inn and Suites,"nice rooms!  here's a tip though. bring some air freshner for the ""non smoking"" rooms."
Quality Inn and Suites,"No TV scroll to see what's on each half hour and the 4:45 am train blowing awaking all. There were no more until about 6am but the track is very close to the motel. Great friendly staff, clean fresh rooms."
Quality Inn and Suites,"In Bossier/Shreveport for work and stayed for three weeks. Hotel is just on the verge of needing an update, but still very nice. I personally think the room rates are a little high, but they do have smoking and pet friendly rooms unlike many other chains. The GOOD: Great location, restaurants nearby you can walk to, right off the interstate... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,Room was a little dirty Murrow needed to be replaced with new mirror
Quality Inn and Suites,"Quality Inn has always been our pick while visiting the Bossier area. Though it's been only a years since our last stay, we were highly disappointed with the quality of the hotel. The lobby looks aged, and the rooms were smelly with mold in bathroom."
Quality Inn and Suites,"I'll preface this by saying I paid 74 for the room so I wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy. We arrived at 5:00 after driving 7 hours and even though the check in time was 3:00 the room wasn't ready, due to a Jehovah's Witness convention. I mentioned a discount and the front desk and she was... More"
Quality Inn and Suites,This was one of the best places we have stayed in our travels. The facility was immaculate. The staff was wonderful. We will try to stay there on our next trip. We will be going through this area on our next trip.
Quality Inn and Suites,Great location for us. We were there for baseball. Price was the best thing about this hotel. The breakfast was non existent. I took my family to McDonalds down the road because they didn't replenish the sausage and eggs and the waffle machine was broke. I never saw the girl that was working the kitchen til we were leaving.
Quality Inn and Suites,the internet doesn't work here!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Excellent hotel. Rooms very clean and beds comfortable. Staff accommodating. Breakfast above average - waffles, eggs, some kind of meat almost every day, juices, cereal along with pastries, breads, etc. Location next to airport very convenient. Did hear a lot of air traffic starting about 7 a.m. each morning, which was not a concern to us but might bother some.... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"The rooms were good and clean, though, a proper closet and some more space in the room would be better, especially for a family of four sharing a room with two queen beds. There were not too many options for hot breakfast for vegetarian diet. The scrambled eggs or omelettes had meat in them. The toaster was not working properly."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"What a fantastic hotel and the friendliest staff you could ever wish to meet. Brittany has to be the bubbliest member of staff you could ever wish to meet. The staff laid food and drink on in the evenings. We were collected from the airport, taken to Pima air and space museum and taken back to the airport when we... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,We had a great experience there
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,We stayed one night as we were going home to Texas. The one thing I want to say about this hotel is that it was noisy. To close to the airport. Never again.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Wonderful breakfasts, great room, great bed"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,A perfect hotel with all the expected services - great fitness room and hot tub. The only disappointment which wasn't significant but just annoying - there was no TV guide to know what programs were playing and/or the info menu on the program wasn't available.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Staff stole 4,000 out of our room, no one not even the GM cared all they said was sorry for your loss no investigation, they did not check or cared who keyed into our room. Nothing!!!!!! do yourself a favor dont stay here, only if your looking to get robbed by their unprofessional, uncaring staff. A message to the employees... More"

When we immediately called the front desk, we were told... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Worst experience!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Very clean and safe close to air port
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Decent room, gym was 8/10. Breakfast was quite good! Our suite was very roomy- which was nice, but no Lamps in the living area except for the desk lamp. We moved one from the nightstand in the bedroom. Bed was a bit uncomfortable for me- I like mine firm. Bathroom was dark, but shower was good!"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Great stay
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Perfect! everything was beyond my expectations! will be coming back for sure!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,We loved this hotel! Everything was great and the employees were very friendly and helpful.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"This is a really good option at this price point near the airport. There are plenty of well-known brands with properties near the airport (including this one). Most of them look about the same online. I picked this one as a budget option and was a bit surprised at how good it was. I've stayed at nice 4 and 5-star hotels and you wouldn't mistake this property for one of those but the staff was helpful, the free breakfast was solid (and the selection rotated), there was coffee in the lobby, and the housekeeping staff was really good (for example, I returned to my room to find my toothbrush, razor, and comb arranged on folded washcloth in the bathroom -not something I'd expect at this price point). It's at the airport so I wouldn't recommend it as a vacation hotel but if you're coming to Tucson for business or want something clean and affordable near the airport, this is a great choice."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,just a night before my flight and park my car until I get back included.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Great customer service. Samantha is an awesome employee she gets the job done. The bathroom was a little dirty at least the mirror was, but it was cleaned in a timely manner. The shuttle bus driver was awesome, thank you"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,very comfortable beds
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Nothing great. Just ok
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Had a very great experience Nice and friendly staff
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Our room wasn't ready. We showed up at 3:30 waited till 4:00 to get into our room. Check in is at 3:00. There was never any complimentary cookies, the dish was always empty. No hot water for cocoa. The pool was dirty. Our room was clean comforable. However, disappointed with our stay. Won't stay at this hotel again."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Great
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Just passing through town. Great location, friendly staff, great overall accommodations."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,I always have a great experience at this hotel!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Accommodations were very good. We stayed in a suite, lots of room but very little furniture. Excellent breakfasts and different variety each day. Couldn't get the internet to work. Had to use my private WiFi hotspot for all internet communications. Maid service was very good and they always replaced all of the used towels each day. We will probably be... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"We went for a family trip to Tucson with two friend families. The stay was nice, we all enjoyed the pool very much. Overall pleasant stay."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Because of a very late arrival I didn't have much opportunity to use the various facilities or amenities. Check in was quick and smooth the room was fine and acceptably quiet considering the proximity to the airport. Lighting in the room and especially in the bathroom was poor - but it usually is in hotels now with energy-saving bulbs. The breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall a good experience.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,great place to stay staff very helpful and friendly. very good thursday night snakes
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"When traveling to Tucson this has been the perfect place to stay. Great rate, hot tub, clean room, good breakfast and very friendly staff."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Staff was super friendly and we were able to check in early which I asked but wasn't expecting to actually happen.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Great Breakfast.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"one night stay at the end of a long European work trip as I got in late and have a significant drive home. Comfortable, clean, close to airport, snacks available, everything I needed."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Rooms were perfect staff was very helpful and courteous
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Great people working there! Every staff member greeted us and we're super friendly! The front desk gal helped us with maps and destinations. The room was clean and comfortable! The breakfast buffet was excellent !
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Nice hotel, worth the price."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"In town for several days for business. Primary objective was to have a reasonable hotel with a reasonable nightly rate. I settled on the Hampton Inn and wasn't disappointed. Breakfast is the usual, simple options. Unless you expect to have a custom-cooked meal, you should be satisfied. Evenings included a simple manager's reception. No free alcohol... Just chips and salsa... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Though it is a very nice place to stay, it isn't terribly convenient when visiting the city on vacation. It sits a ways off the highway, and you will be traveling a few minutes no matter what your plans are for the day (except if you are heading to the airport)."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Good clean comfortable rooms definitely stay again when in town.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,I travel often and stay at hotels at least 3 times a month and this hotel was a overall a good experience. Bathroom needs more lighting and I was not offered my complimentary gift bag as Hilton member. Breakfast was good and staff was super friendly. I would recommend this hotel.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Stayed here on a Soccer Weekend. The employees were great. The rooms were updated and very clean. The perfect mix lobby/ breakfast area was BEAUTIFUL! The pool area is decent and the water was nice! The breakfast was one of the best Hampton Inn Breakfast i have had and many of our team famiies said the same thing! Thanks again!... More
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"It was a quiet stay. The area is mostly airport hotels and I didn't have any glaring problems. bathroom was small, but serviceable and definitely clean. It served it's purpose for the business trip and I Would have no issue staying there again."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,In town for day to visit family. Great stay.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Great stay but the hotel takes FOREVER to give you back your deposit!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Two nights for business. Mainly just sleeping there
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,As a family we have really enjoyes our stay at the Hampton Inn Tucson. We will definitely be back. The Breakfast was a big plus and also all the employees were nice and extremely polite. loved our experience.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,The hotel was clean and the room was very comfortable. Great beds! The buffet breakfast was over and above most hotels.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Remodeled and comfortable stay. Front desk was excellent. For the price we paid we felt it was a very good value. The breakfast is typical of a Hampton Inn and just right. Not too fancy, not too plain. Would stay again. The oranges are excellent on the trees outside. Not sure if you are supposed to eat them, but they were a perfect snack for our trip home."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"This Hampton in is very close, and therefore convenient to the airport. It's within walking distance to at least three restaurants/bars. The room was clean. We had a toilet flushing problem that was fixed quickly. The bed linens were white and clean, but the mattress felt kind of old. The breakfast was good though it had a lot of white bread, white sugar options (to be fair there was fruit and eggs)."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Friendly staff, great free breakfast. I think the breakfast hostess could use some help on the weekends. It was hard for her to keep up with the hungry travelers and their kids:)"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"My family and I were on a road trip to San Diego and decied to stop in Tucson, Arizona for the night and I found this hotel using my Google Maps and called and they were very nice and helpful! The room was very clean and most importantly the beds were just so comfy! After being on the road for... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Above average hotel for the price, could use some upgrades"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,We only stayed 1 night prior to an early morning flight. Great bed and room. Best was how quite the room was enabled us to get a good nights sleep.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Easy access friendly staff clean food good fresh!
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,I stayed at a different hotel in the same location that was more expensive and I didn't like it nearly as much. This hotel was a great price and the rooms were nice and clean and the staff was friendly. I would stay here again.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"A 5 out of 5 hotel to me,great experience"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Typical chain hotel. Everything was adequate but not much wow. The room temperature was hard to control. Was most comfortable when we just turned it off. The bathroom was small, very dark and very outdated. The complementary breakfast was especially nice. There was a great variety of options and the lobby area where the breakfast was served was comfortable and very nicely decorated. It didn't ever work for us to be there for the complimentary happy hour but we appreciated that it was offered. Despite being near the airport we were never aware of any noise from planes. Most of the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Excellent hotel, good location, excellent free breakfast, great staff"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"I knew from the beginning that the place was not close to the main areas of Tucson, although it is close to the airport, so I can't complain about that. I guess is convenient if you are flying. I chose this hotel for the price and because it was not so far from Casino del Sol. Place is good for the price, breakfast is not that bad for a free one. Coffee was great tough. The room was clean but the furniture seems kind of old. Room was quiet although sometimes when other room's door was closing or opening it seemed like it was ours. Pool was not clean, there are several trees around it and a lot of leaves were on it and also there were bees and wasps around the pool, some of them fell on it. Needs more attention. Staff was nice although we did not interact much other than check in check out, and requested more towels. Like I said, it is ok if you need to go to the airport, and price is good. I probably would not stay again on this hotel or any of the hotels in the area unless I am flying."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"We stayed here during the Rock Show and it was fantastic. This time...not so much. Everything was broken - ice machine, wifi, elevator, tv remote, gym. If it had anything to do with technology or equipment you could forget about it."

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Everything about our stay at this Hampton Inn was top notch -- from the exceptionally friendly and helpful front desk staff, to the Happy Hour drinks and snacks (including a make your own nachos bar), to an excellent full breakfast buffet with fresh fruit and other healthy options. Our room was smallish, as was the bathroom, but very clean, with... More"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"This was an overnight stay, as I was stuck at the airport for the night. I have stayed here before. The bed is very comfortable, and the breakfast has a good variety, including lots of fruit. It is dark and quiet in the room (ie you can't hear other doors opening and closing). My only criticism is that it is very hot at night, and you can't turn the thermostat below 65. Also, you might hear airplanes take off in the morning, but that's true of any hotel near the airport."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Room was small but adequate. Clean and lots of hot water.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Wow. Arrived very late and got a room. The place was spotless. The bed linens were super soft and crisp. Handicap accessible.

It was obvious that everyone there took pride in his... More"

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Overall very nice rooms common areas and pool. Got a nice price for the room considering the market area. The room was a modern design flat wall-area to hang clothing and no dresser. There were several wire bins for clothing in the combination entertainment unit.

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,The hotel was awesome. For it being near the airport it was quiet. The rooms were great. We loved that the pool wasn't over filled with people we were the only family in the pool with another couple (they left 45 mins later). The only set back is there was leaves in the pool we tried to look for a net to clean it out ourselves but there was none around..we will plan on going back.
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"My husband and I just love to stay at this hotel. We keep coming back to the Hampton Inn - Tucson Airport Location. The staff is always professional, friendly and helpful. We've tried many others around the Tucson Airport and were not satisfied with the cleanliness and price. The others are much more expensive and not this clean."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,The Hampton Inn Tucson Airport is a nice and handy place to stay while in Tucson. The staff is excellent and helpful. They offered a 10 off coupon at a nearby restaurant.

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Enjoyed the hotel, was very nice. Was put in a room that was adjoined to another and they were very loud. Would think that the walls would have better insulation and or something you could put at bottom of door that would have helped block some of the noise. Very thin walls, did not help to get sleep, had to call front desk to have them ask to turn the tv down, which took a long time. And they still never did."

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"The hotel is no where near a 4.4 star rating. The staff was friendly and the room was clean, but this hotel was very outdated and it wasn't family friendly. There was people smoking at the swimming pool which was horrible for us. I couldn't believe that a Hampton Inn didn't have a closet, but a curtain with hooks behind it! Overall if you're looking for a nice getaway don't go here. But if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a night it's not bad"

The only options for in-room... More"

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,A very nice facility and very close easy access to the airport. The property is well run by a professional and friendly staff.

Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"Loved my room, very spacious! Hotel staff went above and beyond! I needed something urgent printed off my phone and they took care of it right away!"
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"This is a nice, clean hotel. The staff member at check-in was a snob. I am a rewards member but felt like it wasn't good enough for her that I was only the first level member. However, the staff the next day was much better. Breakfast is worth skipping."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"This hotel was lovely. The personnel was helpful, once they explained the bizarre nature of the heating/cooling system (heat was pouring out of the unit because a chair blocked the unit from being seen by the thermostat). Comfortable bed and delicious breakfast, and the location was convenient."
Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,"If you are looking for a good place to stay when you are going in out (quick trip) of Tucson, the Holiday Inn at the Airport is the place. No issues with room, clean, comfortable, wifi worked well, no waiting time for check-in, breakfast, and next to airport."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Although the location is good and the room was fine, the staff was mostly disinterested.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Clean and comfortable room. Hotel staff was helpful, efficient and welcoming. Hotel is an older building, but seems well maintained and managed."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Great visit. Easy in and out of Boston. Parking was great. Great affordability for families on a budget.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Staff was extremely courteous. I inquired about the possibility of having a room upgrade as I had acquired an extra child and they said it was absolutely no problem and there would be no extra charge.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"The front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and courtliest -- HIGH marks. They attempted to resolve some issues we had with the room. We were travelling with 4 people including a limited mobility young adult. We booked a suite for additional room, but the shape of the room was difficult to maneuver. The front desk made some furniture changes for us which was helpful. However, the hotel which stated free parking had limited parking on site (overflow was across a highway in an open lot) and only two designated handicapped parking spaces which were mostly occupied. This made travel difficult."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was good. Parking was a challenge when coming in late. Overall experience good.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Free breakfast was just right to start the morning. Many options to choose from. The front desk staff, Dana and Jonathan, were beyond professional, courteous and helpful! They made us feel as if we were staying with family! Kudos for hiring them."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"When you go to HI you need to understand that it is not a great hotel, it is a good value hotel. That said, this place needs some work. The room heat blew cold air and the elevators were marginal at best. The staff were amazing. This is not about them."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"great location close to the metro. The breakfast is very good and we had a lot of choices. The room was big, clean and very modern. comfortable bed."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"We really enjoyed it, great breakfast, easy to go downtown with the subway, just a few minutes walk to the subway station. Also Museum of Science within walking distance. We will definetly come back"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"My air conditioning was broken and despite several tries from the engineer, it never got below 76 degrees in the room. Lighting in the room was very poor and the set up was not conducive to doing any work. The area was pretty safe overall, and I had no trouble walking to and from my client site in Cambridge. But it wasnt very attractive. Also, beware of the free parking. It really is only about 6 spots near the hotel... the rest is in an overflow across the street that is a little difficult and sketchy to navigate as a woman on her own in the evening."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,this hotel was great the young lady at the front desk was able to check me in 3 hours early! I drove in during a snowstorm managed to make it in early and was able to get into a room immediately that almost never happens anywhere else! the hotel is clean very large rooms spacious and accommodating the bed slept amazingly well! the breakfast was great the staff was very friendly and helpful didn't matter who or what time of the day I went down to speak with them. my only negative thoughts on the property would be the Direct TV crystal clear skies we had no signal off and on all day on the History Channel. the other negative would be park in the parking lot is very tiny however there is overflow parking across the street and that was not too big of a hassle. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in that area.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"As I said, overall a D plus. Couldn't take a hot shower , only one elevator worked, and no gym! Will never stay at this Holiday Inn again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,try the pancake printer when you get breakfast
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Hotel is located just outside downtown Boston and on the green line of the T. We love to get to the downtown attractions of the city, but we also have family outside of town. The location made it easy to get on the highway out of town and also get to downtown. We arrived very late, and our room was all ready for us, including having a crib set up for our 6-month old daughter. The staff was great. The room was large enough for the 3 of us and the crib. The temperature was perfect. The room had a microwave and refrigerator. There were a couple cons about the experience. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was hanging off the ceiling when we arrived. It was fixed during our stay. Also, the breakfast choices her limited our last day. The staff member I spoke with explained that their grocery order had not been received as expected. Overall, the experience was great and we would stay there again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,The room faced the highway and you could hear drag racing all night long. They didn't have ear plugs
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Limited parking by hotel.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,We stayed 6 nights and overall it was a good stay. One elevator was not operating when we got there and during the stay the 2nd elevator stopped working. We had to use the stairs to go up to the 5th floor. They did fix it the same day. My only real complaint is we had neighbors that had a bunch of little kids and we could hear them through our connecting door laughing and talking which disturbed our sleep.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Only one elevator. Bathroom walls peeling. AC ok but bed is so close it is disturbing. Front desk personal very nice and helpful. Breakfast ok but crowded. Parking sparse. Next door is a run down building. Told this Holiday Inn has been sold to independent company. Would not recommend to anyone.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Very helpful staff, nice and well maintained hotel. They dont have a restaurant but I picked up dinner and breakfast at the supermarket next door. Location is in Cambridge but you probably need a cab or car to get anywhere--limited or no public transport and not much is walking distance except few shops as mentioned before. Right on a highway and a quick hop to airport so conveniently located. Overall, if the location works for you, the hotel is a good, convenient, well priced stay."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"beautiful rooms, friendly manager, and free breakfast! had a nice stay."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Andrea really helped out to get an extra day.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Made reservation for two queen beds. Arrived to find no queen beds available.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"From checking in, our rooms cleanliness, the breakfast and checkout, all was wonderful. Plus a dessert that we had forgotten was retrieved from our room and kept for us till we were able to come back for it."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Was here for a couple of nights as I was about to tour a couple of Masters Programs in the area. Location was great - near Logan Airport and there was free parking. Room was great, free breakfast was good and convenient. Only complaint was that there was no workout facility in the hotel and the gym across the way didn't do day passes"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,It was ok. The night staff was amazing (Jonathan) but the morning women were rude and displayed unneccesary attitude. We ask for information regarding buses and directions and they were bothered.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"The hotel was modern and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was adequate for a complimentary breakfast, but nothing special. It's a short walk from a T station, which is key to access to downtown. It's only three to four stops for all the downtown historic areas. Also nearby is a grocery store in case you're interested in stocking the fridge with snacks. The hotel has free parking and we didn't have a problem finding a space. The neighborhood is somewhat shabby, but the price is less than other hotels in nicer neighborhoods - you get what you pay for."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"The hotel staff, front desk, housekeeping, GM...all of them were hands on and excellent problem solvers. Yes, small things were not working, like the business center computer, but they went above and beyond to resolve any inconvenience to me or my family."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"great service, specially from Paola at the front desk she was very helpful and gave us good tips. the area around the hotel isn't the greatest with a lot of abandoned business but was close to Leshmere subway station, so we were able to stay in an affordable hotel and yet be able to easily go everywhere we wanted in...

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Breakfast was good and filling. I particularly liked veggie sausage. Staff was friendly and helpful.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Hotel was easy to find - about a 30-35 cab ride from Logan. Check-in was fast and efficient.

Room itself was Holiday Inn standard - clean and relatively new.... More"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Friendly helpful staff, decent breakfast included, does'nt look much from the outside but it is in a great location for exploring Boston, Downtown is close by ,Cambridge is a good area to explore and Harvard is not too far away"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Good value relative to Boston hotels. Only a five-minute walk from the Lechmere stop at the end of the Green Line. Limited car parking. Breakfast, as other reviews have noted, is mediocre. Normal Holiday Inn Express quality rooms."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Decent hotel near Cambridge and mbta stop. Nice base camp for Boston touring.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Stayed here while attending a conference at Harvard. Not within walking distance, but I had a rental car. The hotel was great! Everything was new, free parking, clean, the wifi worked the whole time, and the breakfast was good. Lots to choose from bacon, sausage, omelettes, pancakes, pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee. The hotel is located right next to a large grocery store, so it's easy to get a quick meal or snack."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Hotel staff were friendly efficient. Room was very clean comfortable. Housekeeping was very attentive (on first day we (4 adults in 1 room) asked for extra towels toiletries. These were provided for the rest of our stay without reminder). Parking was slightly problematic.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Nice hotel and good price
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,My family was comfortable Highly recommended

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Very pleasant staffs and great location for Boston area. 3 blocks from Metro station and easy access to highway. Free parking is A plus.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"We stayed two nights in one of the cleanest hotel rooms I've ever seen. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel was convenient and, while located on a fairly busy street, very quiet. All in all, a terrific value."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Every thing is great, except the shower water is not hot enough. Breakfast is good for this hotel price."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Cozy place to stay. Breakfast was great. Staffs were friendly and accommodating. Downside is that construction is ongoing beside the hotel so its very noisy when heavy equipments are running. Whenever i stay at Holiday Inn Express whether in Vancouver Canada, Hongkong, Philippines i never had any complain."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Beautiful rooms, friendly manager, and free breakfast! Had a nice stay."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"The staff was great and the hotel was clean. However, the beds were not very comfortable and housekeeping completely skipped us one day of our stay."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"I stayed for five nights at this hotel while visiting Boston. Hotel was a walk from local transport but cannot say anything bad about the hotel itself. The room was huge and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was ok, this was a plus and saved me having to look for somewhere to eat in the morning."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Room was clean, microwave, refrigerator, coffee and tea service, free taxi to hospital. Free parking. Not a great location, but a nearby Star market had a nice hot/cold bar. Staff was very friendly and helpful."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Nice enough room. (Keys would malfunction.) Breakfast decent.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"First off there is no parking. There are only twenty spots for all the guests and the rest you have to park on the other side of a busy highway in a small, dark lot and cross the median. We, along with 5 other guests were blocked in for 4 hours by other guests who were not around to move their cars. We missed every morning appt we had . The rooms smelled weird, and the staff was unhelpful . What are you guys doing"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Great breakfast! I wish the desk could have been more help with knowing what tours and things were the best to do.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Overall, the hotel was not all that impressive and the area is a little sketchy. We had to park across the street in their overflow parking lot which was a little scary, but luckily we didn't have any issues. The rooms were clean, but I will likely try a different hotel the next time we are back in the area."

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Decent stay, but tradeoffs to consider if this hotel is right for you: Parking: Free parking/small lot, overflow lot is across a busy road next to a DIY car wash.

Location 2: Fairfield Inn is also nearby/Transient neighborhood, but felt safe Commute cost: Parking in Boston is expensive/subway... More"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Stayed two nights for work. Staff was excellent. Hotel had free parking (nice!) and free wifi, and a free breakfast, but not many other amenities. There was no gym or pool, but they did offer me a pass to visit the local Gold's Gym."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Overflow parking lot across the street has shady guys that drink and do drugs around the clock. I took the attached picture out our window at 9:00 am - twice as bad at 11:00 at night when uploading kids and bags. It was unsafe and a dangerous area at night. The hotel smells bad and the staff was rude. Do not stay at this location.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"We enjoyed our stay here. Quiet, clean, and a place to park without paying exorbitantly. We highly recommend this hotel and plan on staying here again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"My visiting family stayed - not me. The room was big enough, and the Queen beds were comfortable. They were glad to have a fridge and microwave available as standard items, and the parents and children enjoyed the breakfast. I was only disappointed that the rollaway bed was an extra charge that I hadn't been aware of. Occasionally on site parking was completely filled, so parking had to be done across the street. But all in all they enjoyed their stay. (And apples in the lobby are a nice touch)"

You can also catch the 69 bus from close by and... More"
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"We got locked out of room midday due to door lock mechanism. The manager and housekeeping also could not access. Not for pleasure, This was a trip to visit an infant at Boston Childrens with CDH. Maintenance removed the lock and replaced batteries. In the hallway frustrated for shy of an hour. They offered us FREE items and said sorry. We chose 3 sodas 3 snacks (3 people) We were charged for 1 soda and 1 snack, smh. Will not stay there again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,rooms are very nice for the price . few blocks from the t and galleria mall

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,The workers were great help in every way
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"Serves the purpose. Nothing fancy, very practical, free wifi, 10 min walk to a metro station, free breakfast, friendly staff, very clean. I almost gave it five stars, but it just not quite there the windows were very dirty, and there was a minor issue with the bathroom sink."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,The free parking in Boston is a huge plus but the lack of delivering enough parking spaces was a problem. They offered additional parking across the street in an abandoned poorly lit parking lot which was frequented by bums who called it home.

Mattress a bit soft / worn out for my liking. Breakfast ok for US standards (not for European let alone Asian ones) but not very healthy. Although hotel staff (very friendly) and reviews announced that parking may not be available, we actually always had a place even when we arrived late (after 10 PM). Will probably return."

There are not enough parking spaces in the main parking lot for all of the rooms that the hotel offers. The hotel staff suggested that there was another parking lot around the hotel to park in, but luckily we did not have to use that lot.... More"

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,Hotel is easy to find and within minutes of all attractions in Boston.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,The elevator was really really slow and it would bounce up and down when the doors where opening. You had a feeling it could drop any second. The elevator also smelled like smoke.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"That was my mistake. I saw the pictures and I was fine with it. Upon arriving, it's on a highway so the noise can get to you. Luckily, the ac was running a majority of the time. It's located in a semi residential and semi industrial area, so be wary that it's not incredibly safe. The area seems to shut down pretty early (10pm I think is the latest I saw for restaurants). As for the room, everything was clean, and comfortable. Despite our ac unit having to be reset by the staff a few times, it was fine. Just do your research and make sure this is close enough to mass transit for where you need to get to"

Price included Breakfast which was very good, and coffee was available all day. also fridge and coffee facilties in room, no problem taking milk from breakfast upto room if required. I would stay again."
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Cambridge,"In general, the hotel is a short walk to the Lechmere T station. In less than 15 minutes, we are in downtown Boston. It provides free breakfast and the selection is quite good. However, the air conditioner in the room is noisy and it interrupts my sleep. Also, it blows out cold air and the vents can't be closed or diverted to another direction so the position closest to the air conditioner gets very cold. Otherwise, it's a decent hotel."

While this place wouldn't be classed as 5 star, it was definitely 5 star in my book!!"
Tidewater Inn,The hotel and room were very clean and the staff very friendly. We will definitely stay here again!
Tidewater Inn,worst hotel ever stayed in
Tidewater Inn,"We came here last minute because of a bad experience at a different place. We were there in the off season so some things weren't available yet, but they told us at the beginning, so no issues. Our check in lady was so nice and even upgraded our room! it was perfect!"

Tidewater Inn,"We arrived in the afternoon and were out sightseeing all evening. Staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in.

Tidewater Inn,This is a little old but very comfortable central we will probably go again
Tidewater Inn,We were happy to be there for a very brief stay.
Tidewater Inn,Very pleasant stay. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel was a great value and I would stay here again in the future.
Tidewater Inn,The staff that works there is ok. Our hotel room door did not lock. there is a sign on the door that tells ppl it automatically locks but it doesnt. We told staff and they said theyd fix it. When we got back at night we found that our door was still unlocked and it was unlocked all day! We told them again and they said they forgot to fix it. Someone eventually came and replaced the lock after questioning if we knew how to use the door (um i know how to use a door). The mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was clean and u get what u pay for. When we went to check out we and a few other guests stood at the front desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out. Unexceptible during busy check out hours
Tidewater Inn,"Our Tidewater room was in the the rear area, near water with a lawn, chairs and a view of ducks and geese. Very relaxing. Staff was cordial and helpful. Room was clean, and beds were firm, but not hard. Excellent Wi-Fi reception. Both indoor and outdoor pools open- warm mid September.The Tidewater is not a super modern place, but we had no real complaints."
Tidewater Inn,"We stayed for 3 nights in one of the regular double bed rooms. It was dark and poorly lit, and the walls were paper thin. The neighbors were noisy, and if someone jumped upstairs, the whole place shook. The bathroom was dark and had no ventilation, and when you turned on the sink, it made a loud noise. It was not the worst place we could have stayed, but it certainly wasn't glamorous."
Tidewater Inn,Was just looking for something affordable that was still close to the beach and towns. This was decent for the price and was even able to book an extra night since we saved on money!
Tidewater Inn,"When we arrived at 7 PM on the date of our scheduled arrival, with 3 children after driving for 6 hours, we were informed that they cancelled our reservation and had no rooms available. They charged my card after I made the reservation when I was told it would only be used if we were a no show or cancelled (paying cash on arrival as per the website and emails). The card was denied and the room cancelled with no notice, I did get an email 34 minutes prior to arrival asking for feedback on my check in. We the had to track sown a vacant room on a Friday night and paid significantly more money. I will be reviewing this place on Yelp as they have a poor way of doing business"
Tidewater Inn,"While the hotel itself is good value for money but nothing special, the grounds are really nice especially if you stay with kids. The staff also was very friendly and having an indoor and an outdoor pool is something you rarely find in this category. Also the on-site fifties diner for breakfast is a nice touch."
Tidewater Inn,It was very convenient for our New Year'sEve Dance.I will recommend this hotel to others.
Tidewater Inn,I knew that I had not booked us at a resort by any means. Room was cramped. TV was no more than 19 inches. The 'Game Room' was 2 video games and a pinball machine next to 3 vending machines in a hallway. Dirty towels and garbage were not removed by staff when room was done. Bathroom smelled of mold/mildew. Restaurant staff did not wear gloves when handlng food. A good scrubbing and painting are needed.
Tidewater Inn,"Our room was very clean and had an attractive water view, it has a big lawn and it's on a beautiful cove, has 2 great swimming pools and a nice play-scape, is convenient to many beaches and historic towns. Only complaint is the key was hard to use."
Tidewater Inn,"Overall hotel was good. Pool was clean. We booked a standard room and in description, it said private balcony or patio. When we checked in front desk said they couldnt word it as public balcony, so needless to say, not private and they said we could pay more to get one. Ac was loud, they did come and fix it, but then room was warm. Ac was bad. Service was good. Mini golf next door fun! Overall would stay again for cheap ratewat"
Tidewater Inn,"You can't beat the value of this modest but clean family owned and operated motor lodge that has been our off season mid cape haven for the last several years.

Tidewater Inn,"The room was nice but smaller than expected.With the king sized bed and the desk and table it was a little close. The view of the water was wonderful- the pictures on the website do not do it justice- It was quiet, relaxing and the staff was very helpful."
Tidewater Inn,"Everything was perfect. Some neighbor's friends were a little too loud but as soon as we complaint, someone very polite came and took care of it."
Tidewater Inn,"Great location within walking distance of Hyannis. We had a wonderful room (92), very comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking the water where two swans hung-out. Breakfast at onsite was good and reasonably priced, coffee not so good. The front office staff are very friendly and helpful. We stayed for two days last year so this was a repeat visit.... More"

Tidewater Inn,"We have stayed at the Tidewater a couple times in the past, and it's always an enjoyable stay. The motel is older but very nicely kept up. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with flowers. It is a large motel with lots of rooms, lots of space, two pools and a very nice little restaurant on site. As I said, the motel is old but well maintained. The rooms are clean. The TV is old (not a flatscreen) and the mattress has seen better days, but the room had small fridge, coffemaker, hairdryer, iron, phone, radio, cable TV and Wifi. The pool is nice and is 9 feet deep in the deep end. Music playing at the pool made it very welcoming. We didn't use the indoor pool. There are swings, picnic areas and the property borders a lovely cove. The best part was their 1950's decor restaurant where we had breakfast. Very good food and very good service. Nicely decorated and very clean. We would stay at the Tidewater again - and hope our room has a newer mattress."
Tidewater Inn,Sorry but these folks failed miserably. This was an old run down motel that reaked of mold from the moment you walked in. The place was filthy and I would never go back.
Tidewater Inn,Staff very welcoming and helpful. Excellent mid priced motel. Would definitely stay here again.
Tidewater Inn,"This is the most dishusting hotel Ive ever been to. There was mold all over the bathroom, bugs everywhere the pool water was green and full of bugs the carpet was dirty and smelly, the bed was just horrible this place shouldn't be open."
Tidewater Inn,"The mattress needs to be exchanged, very hard. The coffe pot was broken. It was replaced. The room was very clean! The staff very nice and professional !"
Tidewater Inn,The Tidewater Inn is a good place to stay if you are looking for a comfortable bed to come back to after a day of sightseeing or at the beach. The Inn is simple but perfectly allright if you'd rather spend your money on a good meal or something else. The staff and manager were also very friendly. No breakfast is included but you can get breakfast at the diner on site or in other restaurants nearby. Hyannis also has enough places to offer for breakfast.
Tidewater Inn,Older hotel very friendly staff anything that we needed we just asked for and were taken care of
Tidewater Inn,"Wonderful , friendly personnel Very clean rooms Easy access to beaches and places of interest. Safety locks"
Tidewater Inn,"Came for a family getaway weekend. Chose this hotel because of reasonable price and both indoor and outdoor pools and hot tub, and proximity to downtown Hyannis. Staff and room were pleasant. Walk to town was a little longer than we would have preferred. The outdoor pool was cold because of the weather, but the indoor pool was also very chilly and we were extremely disappointed to see the hot tub had been ripped out. Also, we would have liked to check out at 7:30 am, but the office was still closed. We could have called to have someone come out, but chose to come back later. Overall, a nice enough place for the price, but no extras."
Tidewater Inn,Didn't stay in the room much. The breakfast at Helen's diner was awesome. Great food. Everyone was nice. Clean pools. Clean rooms.
Tidewater Inn,"Visited in the off season, so things were limited (here and everywhere). The rooms were comfortable, and the staff friendly. On the main road and close to the beach."
Tidewater Inn,"Nice beaches, close to many points of interest. Beds outdated, TV very old, small size, outdated. Please upgrade to flat screen even if it is small size. Used to have a Jacuzzi, not anymore Staff was very friendly, helpful and going out of the way to offer help"
Tidewater Inn,We were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape. We prepaid for two nights at a great price. However I couldn't stay the second night in this hotel.

Tidewater Inn,"After a bad experience with a hotel on the same strip, we found Tidewater inn. Love the place. Nice rooms, indoor/outdoor pool and a wonderful diner to eat at on the property. Just a wonderful time."
Tidewater Inn,"We are new to the East Coast and wanted to see the Atlantic. We chose the Cape because of a reasonable distance from Hudson Valley, NY. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the Tidewater Inn was so charming and had such beautiful grounds. We had a lovely stay and plan on returning."
Tidewater Inn,we spent a wintery time a few years ago and loved it there. we even got snowed in the morning we were to check out. they told us to stay put until they got the cook in to make us all breakfast. it was lovely and homey. would stay there again anytime. the rooms are lovely and the service is...

Honestly, we were on a tight budget when we booked our trip and sadly the hotels I had been following online kept getting more and more expensive as... More"
Tidewater Inn,"The water in the sink was brown. the room smelled musty and like stagnant water. The shower pressure was like a power washer and not suitable for small kids. the Wi-Fi didn't reach our room. There is no 24 hours lobby so there was no one to call when there was a party in the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door. The staff is all new and the new owners stated they bought the Inn a month ago and were unable to make changes due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming. I tend to believe them as they were all great people they just happened purchased a motel that needs a lot of work. so due to the smell, water, and lack of security this is one of the worst if not the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Id love my money back but I know there's no hope of that."
Tidewater Inn,The sheets were too small the mattress and bunched up underneath me. The plumbing was old and it water hammered all night. Each flush from upstairs echoed through the room. Then the water hammered when the tank filled. The upstairs tenants stomped the night away. There was a nice breakfast place at the indoor pool house. Housekeeping did a good job. Not a great place for a good night sleep.
Tidewater Inn,I loved our stay at the Tidewater. The staff went above and beyond to see to our comfort and the layout of the facility was fantastic. The rooms are dated and the tv was old but for the price and the getaway it was perfect for our needs.
Tidewater Inn,"There are not many choices in town in January, and the Tidewater is not fully operational in January, but I had a nice stay. The diner is closed for winter, and the pool has limited hours (I did not check it out). The staff were friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable. There was a fridge and coffee maker in...

Tidewater Inn,"Stayed Thursday and Friday nights of the long July 4th weekend and really found the Tidewater comfortable, clean, convenient and friendly. Lots of happy people (families, in particular) enjoying the property and pools. We liked our room location near the outdoor (front) pool and noise didn't matter since the pool closed by 9 p.m. Mattress and pillows very comfy, bathroom... More"
Tidewater Inn,Clean rooms and pools. Close to everything. Staff was pleasant
Tidewater Inn,"Room smelled of mold and musty smell.Office was closed when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning. I woke up at 4 am with sinus problems! Front desk was nice, she said she would have manager call me. No call! Figures! stay somewhere else."
Tidewater Inn,"Bought their Living Social voucher for a 2-night stay for 99 (actually got it for 89 on a sale day, thanks Living Social!) for the 3rd time, and it is so worth it! Great location, loved having it still warm enough to have the outside pool open, and the diner on site is WONDERFUL!! Yes, the rooms are not super... More"
Tidewater Inn,Stayed at this hotel(which is not on the beach--about a 15 min-20 min ride and then park)(view is kind of a small pond or marsh kind of area--charge extra 10 not worth it) This is a basic motel. Think there are others that offer breakfast that might be nicer. Check rates and how much breakfast is for your entire party--found... More
Tidewater Inn,"Not a great place at all. Old and run down. Parking lot looks like a meteor shower hit it. The biggest issue I have is that they don't even tend to the room each day. No cleaning or making the bed, no new towels, no tidying up at all. if I wanted to stay in a room with no amenities,... More"
Tidewater Inn,Overnight girls getaway and for a family party in town. Clean rooms. Nice staff. Great location. Pretty view in back. Pools. Diner was good. Free coffee.
Tidewater Inn,A good basic hotel. Certainly not luxurious but clean and fine for a one or two night stay if you don't want to spend a lot of money.
Tidewater Inn,I have seen past reviews on here about this hotel being outdated and old. I booked it anyway due to the price and the fact that we were just showering and sleeping there for the most part. I must say that there is really nothing wrong with this place. The check in was fine. The lobby area was clean and... More
Tidewater Inn,Stay was ok
Tidewater Inn,"Fair price for area and season. Older facility, needs upgrading. Nice balconies and outdoor space. They accommodated a role away bed, in short notice."
Tidewater Inn,"Went on a mini getaway with my husband and 2 kids. It was average. I have stayed 2 other times at this hotel and had much better rooms. I had a king room in the back building. My shower was broken, which they fixed in a timely manner. Pool was locked after it was supposed to open. Had to call... More"
Tidewater Inn,"Easy checking in. Had indoor and outdoor pool. Horseshoe pit area, great outdoor relaxing area by saltmarsh. Saturday night had outdoor movie for families. Beds are low to the floor and a little hard. Room had hair dryer, fridge and iron and ironing board. Had pretty much a great stay. Would probably stay again."
Tidewater Inn,I stayed for 3 nights with my son and we both really enjoyed the experience. The room was clean and met our needs. The grounds were well maintained and he loved the swing set. Both the indoor and outdoor pools were clean and enjoyable. The diner on site made for an easy breakfast our first morning. I'd have liked a... More
Tidewater Inn,My boyfriend and I had previously stayed her three years ago and had a wonderful time. Unfortunately it was not the case this time. We purchased a groupon for a king sized bed and jacuzzi suite. Upon arrival we were not told the room type had been changed until we got to the room. There were two double beds and... More
Tidewater Inn,The price was right...The only thing that was unbearable was the BEDS AND PILLOWS...The mattress had all kinds if indents in it like being warped OR extremely old and I mean old! The pillows were also horrible...As for everything else....tbe the price was right.
Tidewater Inn,"I was extremely disappointed in my stay at Tidewater Inn. I traveled to the cape for the Hyannis Half Marathon, and I was excited to be able to relax prior to the race. Unfortunately that was not the case. When we first arrived we were greeted by friendly staff at the front desk however, the experience quickly changed for the... More"
Tidewater Inn,Pool areas were nice enough but room had an awful musty smell . Could not put clothes in drawers due to strong odor inside. Had to keep fan in bathroom on all day and night and open window to help with odor. Would not recommend
Tidewater Inn,"Check in was promptly at 3:00 on July 4th. Room was ready and was VERY, VERY clean. There is definitely not frills here but it's a clean, comfortable room with all the basics you need such as comfortable beds, WI-fi, tub/shower, separate area with sink outside of bathroom (which I love), small fridge, blow dryer, shampoo and lotion. The tv is old, but worked fine. The Wi-Fi also worked great. You can walk down the road 0.8 miles to a nice little beach, not good for swimming but perfect for a night time rondevous to just sit and watch the water/fireworks/moon, etc. All hotel personnel were polite and efficient, especially considering it was 4th of July on Cape Cod!! The outdoor swimming pool is perfect, we really enjoyed that one morning. Our only complaint is that the walls are paper thin, you can hear someone sneeze in the next room like they are right in the room with you. There really isn't anything you can do about that though, especially when the hotel is sold out. If you're traveling on a budget and just want a good place to sleep, shower, relax at the pool then this is what you're looking for. Oh, and there is free morning coffee in their on-site diner!"
Tidewater Inn,"Nice place for the price. A little out dated, but very comfortable. Close to beaches, restaurants shopping.Very quiet, has a small playground for little kids watching the ducks geese was entertaining."
Tidewater Inn,Was little skeptical when booking but ended up loving this hotel. If you plan to save money then this is the place to stay.
Tidewater Inn,We stayed one night in two rooms. Both rooms were very musty due to be closed up for the winter but better after airing them out. They were clean but very outdated. The parking lot needs major repair (potholes). Convenient location for our needs. Price was right for what we got.
Tidewater Inn,"The Tidewater Inn is a great place to stay in Yarmouth, Cape Cod, MA."
Tidewater Inn,"Older hotel, they do try to make it comfortable but next trip I would try a different place."
Tidewater Inn,Not far from the beach. The outside of the hotel is nice. One could sit by the water (not beach). There is a grill outside.
Tidewater Inn,I have stayed at many hotels over the course of 40 years. I have never wrote a poor review even though the hotels has not been the best place but it has been clean and the person at the desk has never been a lair. Everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is... More
Tidewater Inn,First time in Massachusetts. Great place to stay. Very convenient location. Loved the diner.
Tidewater Inn,It was fine. The on site dinner was cool. I wish the hot tub was working. Flat creen hd tv would be nice.
Tidewater Inn,We had a nice stay. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Staff was family and helpful. We loved breakfast at the diner.
Tidewater Inn,"Decent room, nice playground and indoor pool. Nice views of the Mill Pond also. Close to everything. We had a great price as it was December. Manager woman was extremely nice and so helpful."
Tidewater Inn,"Room was fine, area is great , check in and out perfect, management wonderful and helpful. We have enjoyed many a winter trip...rooms are nice, warm and comfortable and there is so much to do in the Yarmouth area."
Tidewater Inn,"We had stayed at the Tidewater a few years ago and it was satisfactory. This family visit was not. Our room smelled(cat urine). had ants and the screen door was broken. The front office staff was great, but the general manager was not available to discuss the problem with our room. We were having a family reunion(4) rooms and there were 5 children. The indoor pool was rimmed with brown paint and the surface was very dangerous and slippery. Overall, we did not have a good experience We would have stayed another night bot checked in elsewhere."
Tidewater Inn,Decent room. Additional playground. Friendly staff. Very helpful staff.
Tidewater Inn,a quaint motel but clean. Could have used more electric outlets in room though
Tidewater Inn,"Close to all the action of the Cape, clean, suited us perfectly for the cost. It's a little dated but that's to be expected with a Motel at the Cape. Would definitely stay there again."
Tidewater Inn,"The room was large and roomy, with a large table 4 chairs and an armchair a pull out couch. This made hanging out in the room at night much more comfortable - or 2 extra people could have stayed in the room. The grounds were nice. We did not get to use either of the pools, but did see others using them. There is complementary coffee/tea from 7-10 A. M. but you have to walk across the parking lot to the hotel's diner to get it - not a huge distance, but you do need to go outside. Same for the indoor pool. The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. The housekeeping could have been better. They didn't leave enough cups and towels in the room each day - we had to get more from the office. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again"
Tidewater Inn,"We stayed here last Friday night. The place is outdated and sad looking. We were going to stay Saturday night too but we went somewhere else instead. Room smelled like mold. There are dozens and dozens of similar places in this area, I would not recommed this place at all. Go somewhere else."
Tidewater Inn,Great Cape motel close to everything we wanted to see and do. About an hour from Provincetown. Only complaint is beds were aweful very very hard.
Tidewater Inn,"Rooms were basic but very functional and clean. Staff was very friendly. One thing was that the water pipes are really noisy: they knock loudly when you turn them off. Good value, though."
Tidewater Inn,"Friendly staff, gteat breakfast at Helens on property"
Tidewater Inn,"We went to Tidewater Inn again this year, as we have for the last 18 years. I made our reservations for 3 rooms but was not told the hot tub was not in use. We were totally disappointed when we went to check out the pool and hot tub to find it was empty. If we knew this before hand... More"

Tidewater Inn,The only negative I have a complaint about is when coming and going to my car is the geese.I tried going into my car and the geese where right at my door.
Tidewater Inn,The beds were hard as rocks and the TV was very outdated. What concerns me is all the bedbug bites I recieved. Woke me up in the middle of the night!!! I had bite marks all on the side of my one foot that touches the mattress when I sleep. They itch like mad! I told the supervisor in duty and he said he would notify manager Lisa. She never called me! Very bad business.
Tidewater Inn,"We are former Cape residents now living in Tucson, Arizona. We stayed at the Tidewater Inn when we went back for a visit. Our stay at Tidewater was a pleasant and restful time. We had an upstairs room in the back building attached to the indoor pool and restaurant. Great views from the balcony of the tidal river. Our room... More"
Tidewater Inn,This place is awesome! I've now stayed twice in the jacuzzi suite and it's perfect! It was clean and cozy. The staff were really nice and helpful because they offered good recommendations for food. We only go during the off season because we both live near the Cape and know how busy it can get. When we look for an... More
Tidewater Inn,"We had a last minute change to our reservation, and the Tidewater would have been within their rights to decline our request. But instead they took the time to accommodate us, and we were pleased with their flexibility. The convenient location and quiet room were fine. As a result, we'll be back."
Tidewater Inn,"horrid place to stay. was suppose to stay for 1 week. they had me way in back of motel just me and my other guest. we were the only ones back there. felt unsafe. to unlock to get into the lobby back there, the key difficult to use. took me litterly 5 minutes to finally get in. the next day...

Tidewater Inn,"The last time my wife stayed in the area was about 2 years ago and we'd stayed at a different motor lodge a couple miles up the road on route 28. This time we were traveling with our one-year-old child and the last place wasn't the nicest so I decided to spend a little more money to try to get something a little nicer. Wrong. It's an old fashioned drive-up motor lodge. Our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived, I wondered what that smell was covering up. I had a partial answer soon after when I opened the curtains to discover a pair of dirty mens underwear on the floor behind them. The sliding glass door didn't lock other than a big wooden stick which didn't leave me with a lasting sense of security. Speaking of security, none of the keys worked right. The key to open the door to the hallway and the room both required a considerable amount of jiggling to free the lock. I feel badly for anyone stayed near the outside door as it slammed behind with huge BOOM. The TV was one of the old-school standard def models from 20 years ago and was pretty representative the place in general. It was probably last renovated many years ago and it's very tired now. They installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason the tub was about a foot off the ground which left my head about an inch from the ceiling. The mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench. If you stayed here and loved it, great. I will not be back."
Tidewater Inn,weekend
Tidewater Inn,Stay was fine and was upgraded which you would think was a nice touch but then CHARGED (without my knowledge) for the upgrade!!! Watch your credit card if you stay here....
Tidewater Inn,With booking.com we reserved a room from 7-4/7-8 4 nights 88 a night. Checked in after 3 very busy. Waited a few moments. The owner was very nice and helpful. We had a room in the main building upstairs. No elevator!!! It's was only one floor but we made it. Our room was pretty large old and dated but we... More
Tidewater Inn,"Rooms were dated, but great amenities and centrally located. Pool, hot tub and the Adirondack chairs overlooking Lewis Bay were great. Grills and picnic tables on the grounds too. Breakfast room on site and centrally located."
Tidewater Inn,"An average hotel but clean and a little bit old rooms but better than those hotels nearby that had an average reviews, it's Labor Day weekend and taking last minute reservations will give you a headache but made a good decision by choosing this place. Recommended!"
Tidewater Inn,"friendly staff, room was clean though had an odd odor. common areas were attended to daily, but the carpets in the halls, etc were very stained. ok for the value, pools seemed clean, view of tidewater area is nice. convenient area."

Tidewater Inn,The room had an ant problem and the television was old and it had a grainy picture.

Tidewater Inn,Absolutely beautiful location. Great service and will return.

Rooms are clean and with the usual amenities including fridge, coffee maker, hair dryer, ironing board working desk, small table and comfortable chairs.

Tidewater Inn,"The Tidewater Inn was great, clean and the staff very friendly. I was looking for something inexpensive to enjoy the Cape and the Tidewater Inn worked, the rooms, pool and surrounding areas were all very clean. The staff very helpful, I would recommend the Tidewater Inn"
Tidewater Inn,"This hotel had it all! The owner was so pleasant, the front desk clerk was extremely welcoming and it was a great surprise to have chairs outside your room to sit on. They have picnic tables with grills and swings for children. The rates are incredible! The location is perfect!!"
Tidewater Inn,Charles at the front desk was wonderful. Very cheerful and helpful. Stayed in a lovely room facing the water. Room was very clean and large. Disappointed that the hot tub was closed! I was looking forward to it. Close to everything. Felt safe in this area of the Cape.
Tidewater Inn,Was wonderful could be upgraded a little but otherwise wonderful
Tidewater Inn,"Wifi ok views of inlet beautiful, fishing, sitting in nature outdated but clean used. located on busy 28 but less than 10 min from Hyannis and 6. 15 min from Seagul beach: 15 to park but free after 4pm. Old min fridge but worked 19 tube tv. Rear bi level building (inside door access but outside access through sliders) may have more updated rooms than front two bi level buildings with outside entrances. Cute simple mini golf right next to motel with ice cream. Pools ok. No hot tub. Friendly staff. Attentive. Chairs and chaise lounges to use. Big grassy area to play on. Picnic tables. Old small stand up hibachi type grills to use (3 or 4). Kind of a horse shoe pit. New owners last year, 2015. Local restaurant food delivery to your door available. Did not have chance to use on site restaurant."
Tidewater Inn,"We were looking for a clean place to stay that was convenient for day trips to Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and whale watching. The photos are very accurate. Our 13 year old son loved the pools and the game room which had ping pong and foosball. The staff was very nice and went out of their way to help us with our ferry tickets. If you are a high maintenance traveler, this is not the place for you but it met our needs perfectly. WiFi is a bit slow but we only used it to make travel plans. Lots of pretty neighborhood streets nearby to go jogging."
Tidewater Inn,"The facility is handy, clean , and relaxing and the staff is great. The breakfast menu is terrific. The only suggestion I have is for a bigger tv. We've stayed there before and have been pleased. /it is a perfect location for everything in the Hyannis, Dennis and Yarmouth area."
Tidewater Inn,"Very nice peaceful vacation time, great Seagull beach nearby, nice territory with chairs overlooking the lake, great for quite time to relax and have some rest from the busy city life. It was good to have a balcony, I would recommend to ask for the second floor, you can keep the balcony door open and don't use air conditioner all the time. This place is close to Hyannis and other cute places with great seafood restaurants. We were impressed by Heritage park in Sandwich and would highly recommend to visit it if you like nature. Chattam has a very interesting port and lighthouse. Hotel personnel is very friendly, Lisa gave a lot of helpful information. If you don't have a coffeemaker, ask it at front desk. In general a lot of great memories and happy with this very convenient and affordable place."
Tidewater Inn,"I booked a room through Expedia for 2 nights at this hotel. I decided I wanted a third night, so I called the hotel directly to ask if our room would be available on Friday. I was told it was available and that I did not need to give a credit card number to hold the reservation. When I checked in at the hotel on Wednesday, my two-day Expedia reservation was fine, but there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week. I was very upset that I had just driven hours to find out my vacation was compromised. I was also pretty angry, and expressed this to the hotel owner, demanding that he honor my need for a room on Friday because his employee failed to reserve the room for me. He felt that I was making a scene, and threatened to cancel my Expedia reservation, saying I could find somewhere else to stay. I didn't want to lose my entire vacation, so when he vaguely promised to find me another room for Friday, I thanked him. There aren't enough characters allowed to go describe everything that happened in my three days there. The worst of it was, when we finally settled the Friday night room situation, we ended up getting locked out of our room by the hotel, claiming it wasn't paid for. The owner put the reservation for the night under his own name, and he himself processed my credit card on Wednesday when I checked in, yet his staff claimed it wasn't there. The Tidewater Inn nearly ruined my only vacation this year. Do not stay there!!!!"
Tidewater Inn,"If you're like me and travelling on a tighter budget, I would recommend Tidewater Inn. It was, overall, an enjoyable experience. The staff at the reception were courteous and helpful.

Tidewater Inn,"We booked for a July stay based on an affordable rate, location, and the generally positive reviews we'd seen. The staff was pleasant upon check-in, but we were a bit disappointed with the old feeling of the room, lack of light in the shower, etc. We were out and about most of the afternoon and evening, and when I pulled back the covers to get in bed at about 11:30, a reddish-brown bug was trying to scurry out of sight. I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund. After returning home from our trip we called to request additional compensation for our trouble of leaving to find another (more expensive) hotel at midnight but not surprisingly didn't get a response. Fortunately we didn't bring any bugs home with us."
Tidewater Inn,"We had a nice stay for two nights. Excellent location, only minutes to Hyannis."
Tidewater Inn,"Stayed here over the summer. We made a mistake and booked online only to realize when we got there that the rates were cheaper booking on sight.

The carpet needs to be updated."
Tidewater Inn,"We have stayed at the Tidewater a couple times in the past, and it's always an enjoyable stay. The motel is older but very nicely kept up. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with flowers. It is a large motel with lots of rooms, lots of space, two pools and a very nice little restaurant on site. As I said, the... More"
Tidewater Inn,"The room was cheap which was good but the room had tons of fruit flys. We spent our first night trying to get ride of them. Also, when we would shower the tub would fill up w water and not go down. We'd have to shower in our own bath water.... Minutes later after we'd finish the water would finally start going town the drain. Aside from that the room was clean and the amenities would always be replaced. It wasn't a horrible room. It was just ok."
Tidewater Inn,"Was a very pleasant stay...management was very helpful in placing us in a handicapped room. Everything was clean though a bit dated, and our keys were tricky to open the doors, especially the outside ones.

We deliberately chose a modestly priced accommodation. In fact, we used a Living Social coupon. What we found was a very knowledgeable staff who gave us us good hints about the area.... More"
Tidewater Inn,"This motel is really disapointing. We paid 135 per night, the room smells tabacco and humidity, the electricity isnt working most of time, the hair dryer was out of order... 50 of plugs were also out of order. It really needs to be refurbished. The price isnt justified."
Tidewater Inn,I liked the room and location but the internet connection was nonexistent at times (a lot)which really bothered me. Also the indoor pool was way to cold to swim in.

Tidewater Inn,"This property needs a complete make over. The rugs are stained and smell. The rooms are outdated, dark and dank. This is are first and last time here. Such a huge disappointment There are so many other cape properties to choose from"
Tidewater Inn,"Best value on Cape Cod! Clean, comfortable rooms, pool hot tub were great. Service excellent. Right in the midst of everything Cape Cod - restaurants, shopping, attractions, beaches, etc. Repeat customers here, who return year after year."
Tidewater Inn,I choose a garden view room when I made the reservation but got a parking lot view room! Pool was dirty. Diner had good food and service.
Tidewater Inn,"This place is a dump! The outdoor pool was nasty, it had fungus growing on the walls and pool bottom. The first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine! The 3rd room had another smell, we also discovered several bugs in the room. We barely slept on the uncomfortable bed and checked out the next morning 800AM. Will NEVER go back!"

If you need anything just... More"
Tidewater Inn,"The hotel could use a little updating, as others have said in their reviews. The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything we needed was there. We asked for a king size bed and they made sure we got one of the rooms with that type of bed. The Wi-Fi worked fine for us, but I did notice the speed can vary greatly at times. Both pools were kept clean, with plenty of places to sit or lie down. There is a nice little 50's style breakfast diner on site and the food there is just as good as most of the other local places nearby."
Tidewater Inn,"We also checked Trip Advisor and thought this a true AAA approved room. For cleanliness, being an older place, it wasn't all that bad. However the noise level from other guests at 1:15AM was over the top! Banging and pounding! No management on site all night. When we complained the next day, no one else seemed to care. 2 nights...

Tidewater Inn,Room was comfortable and clean. Slider to patio was very nice feature. Diner on premises was great.
Tidewater Inn,"It was a 2 night stay for 4 women. I would say it is the only hotel that I have stayed at in the Cape for this price that I would gladly return to. The rooms were very clean and large. It was nice having a little balcony and the split bathroom. A little odd there were not coffee makers in the room, so we had to do the morning run. A microwave was located at the end of the hallway, and the room offered a mini fridge which was sufficient for our needs. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The indoor pool was very nice."
Tidewater Inn,Very nice hotel Staff were pleasant The breakfast diner was very good Pools and hotel very clean
Tidewater Inn,"Been coming here for ages and the place and the people do not disappoint. Charles did the check in and checkout with speed and professionalism. The room was spotless. The bath impeccable. Refrigerator in the room is an appreciated amenity. Microwave is available in the common area. When it is time to upgrade, perhaps flat screen TV's might be nice... More"

Tidewater Inn,We decided we wanted to get away so we took a shot at a new place to stay in Cape Cod . Nice friendly and caring workers. Room was very clean and of course jacuzzi was what made it even better. King size bed very comfortable. Would highly recommend. Only wish we could have stayed a little longer.
Tidewater Inn,"Very unpleasant visit. we checked in around 2p, after we put our bags in the room, we didn't check the bed, then when we come back at midnight, we found some hair and sand on the bed, we decided not to call anyone, since we all very tired, we didn't sleep at all that night. We decided to check out... More"
Tidewater Inn,"Solid, simple, comfortable and efficient. Room was tastefully decorated, clean and had essential amenities. Great buffet breakfast for our group. Close to fishing marina, Hyannis Ferry, Hyannis Airport, and shopping mall. Indoor and outdoor pools. Indoor hot tub. Staff very helpful and polite. Reasonable prices. Great place for a short quiet stay. Uber service available."
Tidewater Inn,"This is a huge property, with 2 buildings of rooms, an indoor and outdoor pool, and diner.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Nothing better place in Colorado Springs than here.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,We booked two a joining rooms on the second floor and were amazed upon entering the rooms how beautiful the view of the Garden of the Gods were. The whole room over looks the beautiful iconic rock formation that makes Colorado Springs such a special place. We would just sit on the balcony and sit peacefully looking at the majestic... More
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Beautiful views and rooms were very clean. Room service took awhile and overcharged us on the bill. We have two children ages 15 and 12 and they enjoyed the resort very much. Please note that swimming pool for children is located outside the resort and requires a short drive which is somewhat inconvenient. The hot tub was a popular spot and the kids were welcome. Overall great amenities and centrally located. The wildlife on resort grounds were our personal favorite!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Great place - but if you're with children (especially children who have been in a car all day and want to go swimming) please be warned that the beautiful pool in all of the photos is adults only.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Beautiful view. Clean rooms. Excellent room service. Nice location to near by attractions: cave of the winds, cliff dwellings, garden of gods park, pikes peak, and seven falls."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Absolutely stunning resort views with cozy rooms. Loved the partial infinity pool child free!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The Garden of the Gods Club and Resort is a special place. All the rooms face the Garden of the Gods red rock monuments with Pikes Peak as the backdrop. It is spectacular. The rooms are large and comfortable. The restaurant is good and service is excellent. We loved our stay.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,This is a wonderful resort with amazing views of Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. The rooms are great and the restaurants had great food and service. They have numerous activities available. The Resort exceeded our expectations in every way!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Hotel was awesome. Breathtaking views. Only disappointment was one of the waitresses in the hotel casual dining area.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We chose this resort for the view of the garden of the gods, and it did not disappoint! The view was amazing. It's in a nice quiet area of Colorado Springs away from the city. The rooms were nice and large. The bathroom and closet and dressing area was one of the best set ups I've had at a hotel.... More"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,This is my second trip here this summer. I love this hotel.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I believe that Garden of the Gods Club has the best view in the city! It's also very peaceful, which made more an amazing ceremony! The planner was very helpful and very quick to respond to any questions we had. I highly recommend Garden of the Gods Club for your ceremony site, the cost is high, but the pictures and memories will be priceless."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"The fabulous view from my room the fitness center is worth the stay, the spa services were excellent, but the room seemed in need of updating. Bland vanilla decor with small beds. For the price of the room the number of stars, I've stayed at a lot better places. Plus, the pool was super tiny more than a few guests in the pool made it seem like you were crashing someone else's party. Looks like remodeling was underway, but I'd wait until it's complete to go back. Glad I only stayed 2 nights of the 5 I was in town."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I still can't believe how wonderful my wedding day was, and it was in large part due to the facility and staff at the Garden of the Gods Club. First, the location and scenery is INCREDIBLE, people look at my wedding pictures and have a hard time believing they are not photoshoped or altered, everything was unreal! You could honestly feel the love in the air, the scenery for the ceremony was perfect, all the guest rooms that people stayed in were beautiful, the cocktail hour was well run, good bar and great food and the reception was great, amazing food, a sit down dinner for over 200 people, and everyone was happy and well attended to. Rosa the contact I worked with there is incredible detail oriented and amazing to work with. I can't say enough!! Austin Haggard Lawhorn"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,We had a wonderful experience at Garden of the Gods Club and Resort!

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Unfortunately we only stayed one night so did not take advantage of all it offered. Staff was super!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Watching Garden of God and snow-covered Pike Peak from the bed and from the balcony was outstanding. It was very quite and I felt like home while I was staying there. I think it is the best valued hotel in the Colorado Springs.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"What a hotel, I recently stayed for 5 days, the place is simply amazing. The rooms are big and very comfortable, the beds are super comfortable, the bath rooms are huge and the linen makes you want to stay in bed forever. Due to the humidty they had a humidifier in the room as well. The staff were simply exceptional,... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Definitely look forward to staying here again
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,unbeatable views of Garden of the Gods quiet super comfortable
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Pros: amazing view onto the Garden of the Gods, spacious rooms. Cons: excessively expensive, lousy service (outside housekeeping), need to drive to pool. Frankly, the place has more the feel of a rich, racially-homogeneous, gated community than that of a resort."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"AMAZING! This resort was absolutely perfect. The room was large, it had a gas burning fire place, the staff were incredibly friendly. The amenities are unbeatable. I was so lucky to find this gem and if I ever come back to Colorado Springs, I am definitely going to be staying here."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Beautiful
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Amazing hotel! The view from our room was breathtaking and the room, itself, was spacious and lovely. Staff was accommodating and pleasant - food and restaurants were wonderful - and the pool and facilities were sparkling clean and well kept. Highly, Highly recommend this hotel."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Just a romantic one night getaway and it was wonderful. We really enjoyed the heated out door infinity edge pool even in February and the room was gorgeous, spacious, and comfortable. Just a case truly getting what you pay for. Worth every penny. Just wish they hadn't given us a room so far from the spa with a partially obstructed view. Request something other than 219."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Best part of the hotel is the view. WOW! Viewing the Garden of the Gods with Pike's Peak in the background. Amazing! Just sat in the balcony staring at the view for hours.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Unbelievable set up. This room was way cool. The decorating was very unique and sophisticated! We loved the way you could look out the big sliding glass doors and see that fantastic view anytime. We hope to come back again next year!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Loved this hotel. Beautiful scenery, excellent restaurant and bar. Close to everything. Desk staff not that knowledgeable about area but everything else excellent!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Relaxing getaway during the winter. Only one small hot tub in the spa, but wonderful outdoor heated pool. Staff was always friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back for a winter trip."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is a country club that takes in guests. Very upscale and less than ten minutes to the vast dining options in Colorado Springs. Dining at the Garden of the Gods resort is fabulous, too. The mineral formations are wonderful, with a nice park built around them. The resort is in a quiet neighborhood, but has every amenity you could want on-site. Plus, it's in a beautiful part of the country with lots of sightseeing and adventures everywhere. Don't miss it."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This place is a dream land. Prefect rooms, view and an amazing bar. Beautiful decor. You really felt like you were somewhere special."

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Stayed here for just two short days while celebrating a good friend's wedding. Location is stunning, staff are friendly and helpful and all in all it was a beautiful hotel to stay at. Deer and rabbits were out on the grass at dusk and made their way into a few of the wedding photos. Great location for a wedding."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I wish I could give this place a better review than a 3. The location is convenient and the views spectacular. The main part of the resort, including the restaurant and lounge are lovely. The service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and the food we ate there was very good. I had two issues, though, which impact this review. The first is that our room was extremely funky. The bathroom didn't appear to have been updated in 20+ years and was covered in mildew. The chrome fixtures were corroded. In the bedroom area, the popcorn ceiling had black streaks from the air vent. The beds' headboards were loosely attached to the beds and would bang against the wall whenever anyone rolled over.The room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and mini refrigerator and the towels were good. As we checked out we were asked about our stay and we were honest about the issues with the room. The person who checked us out mentioned that by this time next year the patio rooms where we stayed will be demolished and a wellness center will go in. My question is that if they know these rooms are bad, why are they still booking people into them"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Stayed here with my daughter on her first leave from the Air Force Academy. The experience was awesome! Beautiful place with plenty of things to do nearby! Enjoyed tennis and spa! The food was AMAZING!!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is my second visit and our family loves this hotel. The view from our room was terrific, the room was very large, clean and it was very quiet."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Lack of communication was a huge problem with this venue. I initially began the planning process with one wonderfully professional catering manager. She was fired from this venue and I was never informed of this. The successive catering manager was NOT responsive, did not return my calls in a timely manner, and was extremely arrogant. We had problems with our room reservations, late check out communication and a not much was done to accommodate the challenges that we experienced. We spent more than $31,000.00 and were very displeased with The Garden of the Gods Club. We even endured disrespectful comments from club members concerning wedding party members. Their claim to fame is the beautiful background setting...The Garden of the Gods...I was extremely disappointed with their service."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I booked this room for my husband's birthday and we loved the property. The room was wonderful and very clean, and we loved the patio facing the Garden of the Gods. My husband loved the pool and we enjoyed brunch at the restaurant the next day. We will DEFINITELY stay here the next time we visit family in Colorado Springs."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The room and view was amazing. The menu was a little limited and the food was just ok. Everything else was great!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,This place is awesome! I had no idea it would be this nice. Amazing! My room looked straight out at the Garden of the Gods.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We went for a quick weekend away. It was amazing. The view from the patio was beautiful, service was quick and professional, and it was just a beautiful place."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Fantastic stay. Views are priceless.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Amazingly comfortable King size bed with the softest sheets. Huge bathroom, walk in closest,separate toilet, shower and bath. Loved the view from the balcony it was spectacular. Very close to the restaurant but quiet. We used the pool on a couple of occasions."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Worth the view. Gorgeous! Loved our room. Friendly staff. Food could be a little better for the price.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Great views. The service and food was outstanding.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The location and views are second to none. Added enticement is a 27 hole golf course that is in immaculate condition. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Garden of the Gods Club's beauty is unrivaled. It was the most beautiful wedding location we could have chosen in Colorado. The staff was very professional and helped throughout the planning process.We had a few hiccups the day of - such as the salads did not have dressing, things weren't set-up exactly as planned, and we felt pressured to move inside because of early afternoon showers, but overall we were happy with the experience.The only two negatives were the salon (another story) and it is a costly venue. However, you are definitely paying for the view."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"The facility was beautiful and the view from our balcony was amazing. The hotel staff were very friendly during check in. They upgraded our room to accommodate myself and my two children. I was a little disappointed that the rec center with the pool and splash pad were so far from the room. It was about a 5 minute drive into a residential neighborhood. It seems as if the hotel shares the rec center with the neighborhood next to the hotel. However, it was a very nice pool area and there weren't very many people. The pool furniture was very nice and there was a snack bar. Overall our stay was amazing!"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Our room had flies, which occasionally happens when Colorado has such a wet winter, so we called the front desk and they immediately moved us to a new room. We had dinner on our balcony and got to see a whole family of gorgeous deer. The view is stunning!!!! Room service was delicious, quick and not crazy overpriced. The bed was very comfortable. The shower products smelled amazing. Only downside was the actual bathtub was tiny."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This resort has it all. A spa, a view (that can't be described in words), a wonderful staff, a boardroom that is modern, 27 hole championship golf course across the street (Kissing Camels) and rooms are newly renovated and GREAT! Our team and guests are still raving about the experience a week later."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We only stayed here one night, but I wish it was more. First off, the view from our room was incredible, looking straight out onto Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. Was also maybe the nicest room I've ever stayed in. The balcony with the aforementioned view, tall ceilings make the room feel very big, fireplace, pull-out couch, and the biggest bathroom I've seen in a hotel with two separate sinks and a walk-in closet. Granted, we don't stay at luxury hotels so I'm comparing this to your average affordable hotel. Service at breakfast was excellent, although the mostly older and wealthier clientele there made us feel a bit out-of-place with our 4-year-old."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"All rooms are with balcony or patio overlooking the stunning red rock formations in The Garden Of God park. Beautiful in the morning light!

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,We spent three nights here and we were very pleased. The room was large with many amenities. Service was excellent.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Fantastic view of Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak! Loved this place! Most rooms have a great view. We had a little problem with spider mites on the deck chairs but I don't think it was the hotel's fault and they responded quickly to it. Great staff.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Beautiful accommodations. Lovely and spacious suite overlooking magnificent views. Elegant without being fussy, Very friendly and accommodating staff. Good family as well as couples resort.Also a lovely venue for weddings. Lovely grounds and amenities. Would return and enjoyed our experience immensely."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"My husband and I married at the Garden of the Gods 1 year ago! We fell in love with the venue immediately, but were afraid that it would exceed our budget. My husband spoke with Constanze about our budgetary restrictions and we were both surprised at her ability to make it happen!!! This was the first of many accommodations Constanze & the team at GOG made to make our day SO memorable & absolute perfection!!! There are sincerely no words to express our appreciation for Constanze!! Not only is the view remarkable here (our family & friends from out of state were awestruck), but the food is also DELICIOUS (which we've heard is rare to find).. I wish you luck in your wedding planning.. Remember what is important & forget the rest :)"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Garden of the Gods Club was the most beautiful venue we found in Colorado and my husband and I are so pleased we decided to marry there and have our reception for 120 people there in the main dining room. Although it was expensive, or more than most venues, it was worth every penny. The staff, especially Rosa Falu, their wedding coordinator, was incredible. Although it rained and we could not marry out on the lawn overlooking the beautiful rock formations, they have a gorgeous terrace that was still wonderful and romantic. There were deer on the lawn in the midst and the guests sipped hot chocolate in September. The food was delicious and the cake was the best anyone had ever tasted. The rooms were gorgeous and everyone was pleased and said we had the most beautiful wedding anyone had ever been to. I highly recommend Garden of the Gods Club!!! Everyone should be so lucky to get married there!"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Our room included a patio with a view of the mountains. The king size bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The laminated floors were shiny and well kept. I usually have problems with hotel rooms because of the carpeting. The only carpeting was around the bed so you didnt have to put your feet on cold floors when you first get up. There were two vanities across from one another so there was plenty of room to get ready without being in anyones way. It also included a walk in closet.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Here for the Labor Day weekend and my worst fear became true. I'm in a room in the South wing. Don't get me wrong the main resort is beautiful but my room is disappointing. I booked through Hotels.com so this could be the reason I'm in this wing. Bed is comfy and view is amazing. Fixtures in room are dated,... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"The venue was AMAZINGGGG. Not only did they offer us amazing views, perfect picturesque setting for our ceremony and reception, they were AMAZING to work with.

All our vendors and guests were blown away by the venue and the service. Everything was amazing. The day was even better than we ever imagined. THANK YOU!!!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Our wedding will be in August of 2016 and we are trying to plan about 8 months in advance. The service and responsiveness of the employees here was unbelievable. I received emails and calls within 30 minutes of my own, scheduled a tour, and received top notch service. The venue is beautiful and they allow you to make it your own. They encourage you to select vendors that you like are are comfortable with price-wise. They also guarantee the cost within around $100 of the total. Absolutely wonderful experience so far, and I'm excited to continue to work with them!"

Excellent staff, very comfortable bedding, nice bathroom layout to accommodate more than one person at a time (separate sink, toilet, shower), great pool, excellent (multiple) dining options. We really enjoyed our stay --- the overall feel is formal country club) which feels a bit at odds with the outdoor activities we were in the area to do (hiking Pike's Peak, whitewater rafting, horseback riding, etc.) I'd suggest that travelers know that this location has formal dress requirements for certain restaurants, etc. Great outdoor pool areas for adults as well as kids also a game room (pool, foosball etc.) made for great family times. We'll stay again, but remember to bring some nice clothes."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Room was large and had beautiful views. Breakfast quality was excellent with many choices. Location close to Manitou and the Colorado College area. We would definitely stay again.

Gracious elegence in the Club. Memorable stay!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Our son was married here in early August. We can't say enough good things about the helpful and friendly staff the beautiful view great food and reception service.

We were upgraded to an incredible lovely suite with a spectacular bath area, beautiful living area and one of the most comfortable beds we have ever experienced. Our balcony looked directly over the garden pool area and of course the Garden of the Gods. We had a fantastic meal with great... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The resort is an excellent property with outstanding views of the Garden of the Gods. The staff is superb and the rooms are excellent. We visited during non-peak season and the special they were providing during this time made the stay a great value. I would provide a similar review if I had not received the promotion. I would definitely... More

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We've stayed at this property before to enjoy the spacious rooms and incredible views. This year the resort has upped their game.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"You simply cannot beat the amazing view of the mountains and gorgeous red rock formations, especially from a mountain view room. However, given the cost of this property we expected more from it. No single problem was a major issue but multiple little nagging things added up to a very disappointing experience at this resort: 1. Poor service in the... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Unfortunately, we were only able to stay here one night and we arrived later than anticipated, so it was after dark. It was difficult to tell much about the place on a dark, rainy night, but it seemed nice inside and check-in was easy. As soon as I walked into the room, I was totally blown away. I've never seen...

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,This is a wonderful resort with spectacular views over the Garden of Gods - get up early to watch the sun rise and highlight the red rocks below.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I understand that the Garden of the Gods Club Resort has been sold to a group of local investors in the Springs (http://clubandresortbusiness.com/2013/11/01/garden-gods-club-sold/) back in November 2013. As a result, this club, which was largely developed in the 1970s and still has that feel in parts of the property, seems to be very much on the upswing. The staff... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The resort upgraded our room to their BEST suite at NO extra charge. That was amazing in and of itself. The service is 5 stars. You can get any menu at any of the resturants so you can be casual and still have the elegant meal. They have these home made potato chips with Cilantro/Ranch Salsa MAJOR yummy. all of the Staff knew we were getting married in a few days and treated us like Queen and King. The views from this resort: NONE are bad our wedding guests had a great time as well.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Garden of the Gods is beautiful. Tennis was fun, the deer were our spectators, the spa was great, food delicious, rooms comfy. Life was good. Oh, I forgot to mention the eternity pool that had the Garden of the gods view. Beauty."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The entire experience was wonderful. They anticipated our needs before we did. We'll definitely go back.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Beautiful, large new club rooms with separate vanity/walk in closet area. View is breathtaking. Deer and bunnies roam the lovely grounds. Casual restaurant bar had incredible views, outdoor seating, great food and charming service. Would definitely stay again. Broadmoor for a drink, but GOTG resort to stay."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is a must stay. Great location. Nice staff. Don't miss out. One of my favorite stays ever at a resort. Okay, it was my favorite. My wife loved the wild life that came out in the evenings. Late at night we sat on the balcony and enjoyed the quiet evening. I hope to go back some day."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Wonderfully relaxing, with outstanding customer service."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This resort is absolutely gorgeous. The stunning views of Garden of the Gods is breathtaking.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Amazing views from every room we have stayed it. The staff is friendly and helpful. We are natives of Colorado Springs and we go every year.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The resort was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable! Our experience from check in to check out was awesome! And the views from our room were breathtaking! Our stay was peaceful and went smoothly! We definitely will be staying here again!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is one of the most wonderful places we have visited. I could wake up and have coffee on one of those verandas, watching the sun hit the Garden of the Gods, every morning! The rooms are quite comfortably over-sized, including a very large bathroom/closet/dressing room. The staff was very friendly as well. We liked this so much that I... More"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"My husband and I are from Florida and had a small destination wedding, 15 of our close friends and family, at The Garden of the God's Club. I had contacted Constanze 4 months out and told her what we were looking for. She immediately made me feel comfortable with choosing the club to accomodate our special day. It was very overwhelming trying to plan things out of state but Constanze made it a stress-free process. She referred and put me in contact with all of the other vendors we needed and I was pleased with every one we picked. I am a wedding florist in Florida so I was wanting to provide my own decor. She allowed me to ship my linens, vases and flowers and kept them save until the night before the wedding. I arrived the night before to find my room upgraded to a suite that over looked the snowy mountians. The morning of the wedding she took care of everything from setting chair up outside and making sure everything was executed right on time. The food was delicious and everyone was raving about it days afterwards. If I had to do it all over again I wouldnt change a thing. Being in the wedding business I have a lot of experience with vendors and venues and I was very happy with the professionalism. The club is a gorgeous venue with a amazing view of the Garden of the Gods. I would highly reccomend the club for any weddng or event."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We stayed in a King Suite, in the northern wing of the building. The decor was very tasteful and the room was obviously recently updated.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Overall, an absolutely awesome resort. We ended up spending few days at the end of our ski trip in Colorado Springs for some RR and this was the perfect place. Service is great, rooms are spacious and immaculate. Will definitely stay here again when we are back in town!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"The wedding coordinator that I worked with was a little hard to get ahold of at the GOG club and slow to return my calls. However, the day of the wedding was executed perfectly."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Beautiful natural setting with outstanding service and very responsive staff. Prices were reasonable. Excellent golf course and good food. Nice adults only pool near rooms. Would recommend for a long weekend couples getaway. Advice: ask for second floor room (some walking traffic behind rooms on first floor, reduce privacy)."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Someone wrote on TripAdvisor that some of the rooms were older and in need of updating. At check-in we were told that all of the rooms have been updated, so that is no longer an issue. We found a lovely clubhouse lobby, delightful restaurants bar, well appointed rooms, and a relaxing atmosphere unlike that of another resort in the... More"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,I fell in love with this venue at first site!! The view from the lawn is spectacular and can't be beat. Constanze is a dream to work with and made the whole planning process move along smoothly. The Club is very flexible and made all my detailed dreams come true! The food and service at my reception were exceptional and the wedding/cocktail hour/reception were flawless. The value you receive at this venue is well worth the cost. I HIGHLY recommend this venue for your wedding!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"If you are staying in Colorado Springs you absolutely have to stay here. Yes it is a bit upscale in atmosphere but the rooms with the view to the garden of the gods are like no other. My patio faces them, bunnies hung out in the yard and while i was walking near the tennis courts a deer cam right... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,The scenery was drop dead gorgeous! Every morning you awaken to this breathtaking view. The service was impeccable. Such a friendly staff. The grounds were beautiful and full of color from the surrounding flower beds. The beds were very comfortable. We only had two issues: no microwave and our couch was a little worn looking for the money we spent. Would absolutely go back.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We've stayed in downtown Colorado Springs a number of times, but we love garden of the gods area so decided to try this resort. Unbelievable!!

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This resort offers breathtaking views from spacious rooms with very nice amenities. Our room was quite pleasant, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Spacious comfortable rooms atop a mesa overlooking the Garden of the Gods park. Excellent restaurants. Seems busy nightly with weddings, conferences, or other functions. Only complaint is that my wife thought that the 'members' were somewhat snobbish to the 'guests'."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,Most beautiful location for a wedding in Colorado Springs! Rosa was exceptional to work with. I felt pampered and taken care of. We have not stopped hearing great reviews from guests at our wedding.
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Our family used to be members and it was always one of our favorite places for special occasions because of the breathtaking location, impecible service and wonderful food.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We stayed here two nights and didn't leave as much as we usually would because it was so amazing.

I decided to splurge on booking this on our road trip because the view... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I'm a native and I had no idea this hotel existed until I was searching on hotels.com - it was a little out of my price range and there wasn't a cancellation option when my event got postponed, but I'm so glad we went anyway. It was such a beautiful property and we had a great time!!! The only feedback is that the bed was way too soft. A bed upgrade would make this a yearly repeater for us!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Great food ,Mountain views, beautiful room. Stuff was very attentive,would totally stay again! We had a fireplace in our room which was awesome when it start to snow on our third night in Colorado Springs."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"All rooms have a great view, ours was located with a great view of the garden of the Gods.

Very calm and peaceful here! Saw deer right on the lawn outside our room! Should have stayed here for our entire stay!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Beautiful views, delicious food, relaxing atmosphere. Ask for a room on the 2nd floor facing Garden of the Gods. Breathtaking!! We sat on the covered patio with the fire pit to warm us during an amazing rainstorm. Employees are very nice. Also played golf at Kissing Camels North and West courses. Great golf!!"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I was looking for a day spa while traveling to Colorado Springs. So, I found a nice semi-private club. The pool was small, but nice. The massage was nice, average.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"So happy to find this place.

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"We could not be more thrilled with our decision to host our wedding at Garden of the Gods Club and Resort. The scenery (with Pike's Peak in the background) clearly speaks for itself, and the event could not have been more stunning. The staff at Garden of the Gods was an added blessing... they are absolute professionals in every way possible, and we knew from day one we were in great hands. Every needed detail was executed flawlessly, and they went above and beyond to make our guests feel welcomed and special. The food was also spectacular - we were able to work with the chefs to create a menu that suited our event perfectly, and we're still receiving compliments over the menu. I'd highly recommend John, Jayme, and Paige at Garden of the Gods in a heartbeat. Thank you all for making our day everything that we had dreamed - and more."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is a really nice resort. Great rooms, great service, and great food. I have stayed here many times and have never been disappointed. Being in Colorado Springs has a huge advantage because they have 300 days of sunshine a year. The views from your room are fantastic."
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"I booked a room for this resort on tripadvisor, after staying at this resort many years previous. I can not tell you how disappointed I was with the room. It was horribly outdated with popcorn ceiling, 1980's type decor and bathroom style. This resort was listed as a 4-5 star and I would not give it more than 2.5-3 star.... More"

Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,My husband and I got married at the Garden of the Gods Club in May 2015. The catering staff was phenomenal. John Kerr and Jayme Broadnax went above and beyond to make sure our wedding was perfect and beautiful. Both were very friendly and accommodating and made sure everything ran smoothly the day of our wedding. The food was spectacular and the venue was just breath-taking. I still have people telling me that my wedding was the most beautiful one that they've ever gone to and that the food was superb. I couldn't be happier. I would recommend this venue to any bride!
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"Our family took a trip through Colorado, and after staying in numerous chain hotels--many of which were quite nice--we stayed here one night and wished we could have stayed longer. The view from the room is unbeatable (though there is a little street noise from below), and in the morning we had deer less than a hundred feet from the... More"
Garden of The Gods Club & Resort,"This is a wonderful resort with awesome amenities and, best of all, a jaw dropping view of Garedn of the Gods from our room and also from the lounge. Rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, staff is very friendly and helpful, multiple pools to choose from, nice spa, tennis courts, etc. While we were at the resort there was some construction going on, but minimally invasive to our stay."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,The room was clean and interior decor was very good condition. The staff was helpful and attentive. The included breakfast was a nice touch.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Hotel met all our needs.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"The room was pretty dated (very old vanity and furniture). It was clean just not what I've experienced historically (I stay exclusively at Hilton properties). The breakfast was average at best. Most Hampton Inns offer some sort of meat with breakfast, none here. The location was convenient for my trip."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,LOVED THE CONVENIENCE. WE ALWAYS SAY ... YOU NEVER CAN GO WRING WITH A HAMPTON INN!
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Concert in downtown Annapolis. Hotel was close however, the bes was to small for a couple and we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Great Hampton inn very inviting and clean. Short drive to harbor and restaurants and Naval Academy. Only thing I would have preferred is two queen beds rather than King and pull out couch as we had an adult child.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,The staff was very helpful and pleasant. The breakfast buffet was good but crowded.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,It was nice and comfortable
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,It was real relaxed
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"GOOD EXPERIENCE. THE SMOKE ALARM WRANG ALL NIGHT FOR TWO NIGHTS IN THE ROOM NEXT TO MINE THOUGH. BECAUSE I COULD HEAR IT THRU THE WALL I REPORTED IT, BUT IT TOOK THEM TWO DAYS TO FIX IT. THAT WAS VERY BAD !!!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Friendly staff. Nice facility. Great location. We would stay at the Hampton Inn Suites Annapolis again.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,The location was convenient. I drink tea and there was none in the room. nothing nearby. would have enjoyed convenient dinner options
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Annapolis. The hotel is conveniently located near the Naval Academy, and is reasonably priced. We were in a suit with 5 people. We had ample room. There were always enough fresh towels for us to use and the room was always clean. The bed was very comfortable and was a welcome sight at the... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Nice staff but facilities were lacking. We made a reservation through Expedia for a queen size bed but they had none. And there were no kings available. Wi-fi was inaccessable, at least from our I-pad and the staff tried to help but could not figure it out. Heat in the room was inadequate. The only bed cover was a duvet which was too warm even in a cool room. We're just not European. Breakfast was nice and the staff was accommodating to the limit of their facilities."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"I had a great stay, I and so many others where snowed in and all airports where closed and the staff was caring and helpful. Loved the rooms and how clean the room and hotel stayed. The rooms where warm, all bedding smelled fresh and inviting. The breakfast was very good and filling. Coffee and hot water for tea and...

Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Son was attending camp at the Naval Academy. Overall hotel is nice, off main road on private drive. Nothing within walking distance but shops and restaurants close by. Hotel staff needs to stay on top of breakfast as the food ran out for the number of guests eating. It was a little crazy."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Excellent location - quiet, shady, near everything. Facility neat and clean. Our room was comfortable and above all super clean. Lots of area to relax in lobby, out front, on patio, by pool. Staff very friendly, pleasant, helpful. In addition, if you are traveling with pets, this is the place to stay in Annapolis!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"I was working in Washington, DC for the week and was unable to find a hotel which met my companies per diem rates, I'm familiar with Annapolis and Hampton Inn hotels so I put two and two together and booked a room. Great decision... The hotel is tucked back off of the main drags so it's really quiet. That being... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Already sent report to customer service. Not very happy with stay.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Every room is pet friendly and the staff were pet friendly and it was SO wonderful to be able to take our pet with us an not struggle with a dog sitter.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Nice rooms, great location and accommodating staff. We arrived and were allowed to check in two hours early with no problem. The staff was knowledgeable of the area and traffic. It does not get any better than that!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Check-in took a long time because -I believe- they were overbooked. I paid for the room ahead of time. Why not just keep it for us
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"As always, the Hampton Inn does not disappoint."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Upon arriving from Ny, we were told our room was not ready and check in was at 3. Well we were there at 3 and had to wait until 4:10 to get our room. When we entered the hall that our room was on there was a dog barking and a dog howling on both sides of our room. We... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"We loved the outdoor pool and courtyard, breakfast was great, and kids loved that there was a pool table. Only complaint was the pull out sofa mattress was not very comfortable. Overall we had a great stay and will come again!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,The night staff was very nice with an easy check in. The rooms were ok clean but out dated. The breakfast was good with lots of choices. There was a waffle maker where you can make your own fresh made waffles.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,5th floor Room was needs update
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"I have stayed at this Hampton Inn before and was quite disappointed this time around. Check in was fine, but when I got to my room the TV did not want to work and the bed was very uncomfortable. At around 10:20 PM in the room across the hall someone had left a dog in the room and all it could do is yelp and cry, when I called down to the front desk the desk clerk was very abrupt with me and said to deal with it. The dog cried for almost two hours before the owner came back to the room. This happened periodically through my two day stay here , even after mentioning it to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed. Also when I went to take a shower I very rapidly was standing in six inches of water because the tub would not drain. All in all not a very relaxing two days in Annapolis. I will NOT be staying at this hotel every again."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Hotel was clean and nice. Staff was very friendly and attentive.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"A beautiful suite with separate king bed and room two TVs full size refrigerator, stove top eat in kitchen. And great location for almost everything."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"We stayed over the Thanksgiving weekend with our puppy. The room was clean, the hotel employees were very helpful and friendly. The hotel's pet policy is perfect for owners of big dogs (no limitation for breed or size), considering a surprising tendency of many hotels to limit canine hotel guests to only small yuppy dogs."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,This manager was super rude his name was Rick and he wishes unaccommodating aggressive and unapologetic. He was downright disrespectful. I would never expect this from Hilton brands anywhere. I'm not sure how he made it this far in the service business with that attitude
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"This Hampton Inn has all the Hampton things: coffee, tea and fruit all day, a pretty good breakfast, clean rooms with an inside hallway, and a reasonable price. This neighborhood is a bit away from Annapolis attractions, with several hotels in this price range. This is about the best of those. Of course, there is no restaurant, but in Annapolis you want to eat at one of the many fine places nearby."

The hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we wanted to see. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was a decent standard hotel breakfast. the coffee did not disappoint. The room was small,and on the surface clean enough, although the wall above the lights between the beds was covered with dark dust. The bath room had the lowest sink I have seen since elementary school! There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom,which made for predictable problems. The carpet felt dirty when walking on it in bare feet. This hotel is located in a business park area. There is shopping close by. Area felt safe."

Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Great Hotel, Horrible Customer Service... I had a reservation for two night. My son's tournament was cut down to two days so I needed to cancel one night. I have stayed here multiple times and blocked rooms for the entire team in the past. I actually recommended the hotel to another random lacrosse mom in an airport only last week.... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Avoid Room 524! We checked in late, so it wasn't until the next morning that we noticed dozens of small brown ants all over the bathroom floor. God only knows how many were in the brown carpeting! When I called the desk, the gentleman said Oh!, as though he was genuinely surprised. When I mentioned that we read about their... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Very pleased with our stay. Nice facilities, good breakfast, nice lobby. Rooms clean and well maintained but could use updating. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Location was very convenient for our business and close to Town Center."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,The event was amazing..all you can eat crabs beer and food.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Rooms are badly outdated. Drywall work in bath is shoddy. Vanity too short and too small. Food at breakfast barely edible. We chose to eat out after the first day. Found old socks under dresser. Not a 200 room.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"I was not impressed by this hotel. The room was dingy, outdated and not as clean as I would expect. The bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained. The carpeting throughout the room was likely vacuumed, however it felt dirty to me. The armchair in the room was also very old, not even sure why they would keep it there in its frayed condition. Overall, it was fine for 1 quick nights stay, however I would not book this hotel again in the future. I did enjoy the company of the cricket (yes, live cricket) who greeted me on the nightstand upon my arrival! :)"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,It was very professional and comfortable. Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and atmosphere. I would stay here again. The room was very clean and organized. The staff was friendly and professional. I recommend this hotel to others.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"Even though renovations are apparently over (based on another tip saying that would finished Spring 2012), the hotel could still use some serious upgrades. Posting a pic of the bathroom as an example."
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Pleased in every way. Close to stores for all tastes and price ranges.Downtown Annapolis just minutes away.Almost park like setting with excellent pool.
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"This is the best hotel I've EVER stayed in!! The staff is wonderful, friendly, helpful! Rooms are so nice, patio for eating on or just visiting, complimentary breakfast is great, so is the complimentary nightly meal! Great outdoor pool, exercise room, every staff person is helpful and friendly, cleanest and nicest place you'll find for the price! Wish I could've... More"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"It was first time traveling with our puppy, and overall it was a great place. The staff unfortunately was average and should be taught to give preference to customers who are actually there! We wanted to give our year old pup a break while we meandered around Annapolis, but no deal. Bad communication. Breakfast should have extended hours. Overall, fine"
Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,"After battling traffic on the Beltway it was a pleasure to check into the clean, comfortable and quiet Hampton Inn. The staff, as the case with every Hampton Inn I've stayed in, was warm and welcoming. Our room on the 5th floor was comfortable and clean. So why only 4 stars Minor reasons and certainly shouldn't deter you from choosing... More"

Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,Don't drink the tap water. I don't know if it is the hotel or just the water in the area but it is not good. And just stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. This place needs a remodel.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,There agsin different room it still plumbing problems thid one ghd toliet would not flush when j checked coming into the room
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The carpet was very old and several parts were torn. The room smelled like mold. Front desk service was very good. This was not a 2.5 star. It was terrible. I had a bad feeling when we pulled in and half the neon sign that says 'Hampton Inn' was out. I would not recommend this hotel.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"This hotel had the basic qualities that I would expect from a 2.5/3.0 facility.It was a little crowded the weekend we were there due to some soccer teams in town. I would say, many 12-15 yr. old boys. The pool was very crowded as was the fitness room and breakfast room in the morning. I also feel that for the price, a room with 2 Q beds, for 4 people, should be a little larger and include more seating options.....and, should have 2 part bathroom with 2 sinks."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Enjoyed our stay in Sarasota area. Bathrooms at hotel need vent fans to exhaust heat from shower. Caused floor to be slippery.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,I always stay at this hotel when I visit Sarasota. The staff is friendly and accomodating. Older hotel that has been updated as needed. Beds are comfortable and my rooms have always been very clean. Easy location. Restaurants close by. Hotel offers a good breakfast. Nice pool area.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Great place for business travelers. Close to I-75,surrounded by places to eat and shop if needed. Loved starting the day off with a good breakfast and fresh coffee. Check in and out was easy. Nice staff."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,My wife and I were on a 10 day road trip around Florida and wanted to stay in a Hampton Inn close to Siesta Key Beach. We decided to stay here though it is still a bit of a drive to the beach. We had a nice room overlooking the small lake out the back. The room was clean and... More
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Great stay
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The only issue was the ice machine on the third floor didn't work and the hot tub didn't work so it was far from a hot tub. Staff was pretty nice and the rooms were very clean. The complimentary breakfast was really good and fresh.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"For 210/night the room was not what I had expected. There was dust on the table between the beds, plastic bags were not in the trash cans and I had to put our trash on the counter in the bathroom. There was dust on top of the head boards and the lights. I was very surprised that there was not a microwave in the room as nowadays most places do."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The room was perfect with updated furnishings and was very clean. The service was excellent from check-in to check-out. One of the best hotel stays I have had. A full course breakfast including sausage and eggs was icing on the cake.

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Great stay!
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Bathroom was dirty
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,This Hampton does not measure up to others I have stayed in I payed more to have a 'pure'room. It included a air purifier. The first impression was very negative as the maid had left a wash rag from a previous visitor hanging wet on the shower rod. I grabbed a clean towel and threw it on the floor. Bed... More
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"The hotel was clean and updated, but we stayed for two nights and they did not clean the room. We called and they said the manager would get back to us but never did. We mentioned it at checkout and not even an apology. The location was disappointing. Overall it was not worth the rate we paid."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,We liked coming back from our day trips and unwinding in the pool. Also had a great breakfast. Room was clean and beds were comfortable.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Meh. Couldn't get the hot water to work at night or in the morning for a shower. Really Irritated. We came in late and slept late, but the water had no pressure or heat."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,All in all the stay was just fine. A few things we noticed. The shampoo/ conditioner/ lotion were all half full (used). The toilet did not work right. The bathroom door did not close all the way. The toilet paper holder was broken. The room was fine for what we needed. The bed was super comfy. We were able to control the temperature in the room no problem. The lovely lady who ran breakfast was charming and helpful with the guests. Always a smile on her face. Breakfast was yummy. Nice selection. The kids working the front desk were helpful but could have been a little more personable. Aside from those little things we had a nice stay for the price we paid.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,awesomeness! !
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Not Hampton's usual quality. Hotel shabby, staff very rude."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,When we checked out we asked why there was no coat/clothes closet. There weren't any hangers to be found. They said it's hidden behind the window curtain!!! The breakfast buffet was over too early..Some of us like to sleep in while on vacation. Not enough pillows.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Great visit to Sarasota to see family. The only issue was the WiFi. It was very hard to get hooked up and when we did it would freeze. Room was great service great. Would definitely stay again just have to bring my Hot Spot.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The electricity went out in the room. The front desk made perfunctory but unsuccessful attempts to restore it. The parking area could not accomodate all the cars so we had park in unauthorized areas. The breakfast area was so crowded that tables were doubled up. When I pointed some of these issues out to the manager on call I was advised to take up any issue with the provider through which I booked the room. I cannot wait to go back.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Very minimal breakfast
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,I was here as a dragon boat team member for the International Festival held at Nathan Banderson Park. This was a huge event and many hotels had teams staying at their places. Our rooms were really clean and fresh and the hotel always had complimentary refreshments available to guests - even cookies and fresh fruit were available - the breakfast... More
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Good hotel but had three bad things. The wall material next to the window was falling off, the bathroom door wouldn't lock and the bathroom vent was broken. Other than that it was fine. The location was great because there was a Starbucks n stores right across the street."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Room had an odor. There was a clean air machine to overcome the odor but was too noisy to sleep. Room was overpriced even considering the season.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"I stayed here because it was close to where I had business meetings. While the room had clean sheets and bath, etc., there was a discomforting smell of some cleaning agent that bothered me throughout my stay. Breakfast was included and was decent nothing to rave about."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Check in went well. The room was nice and the bathroom was spacious. However the bathroom had a urine smell that I couldn't figure out why.

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Very noisy guests..
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"When they cleaned daily, all they did was replace the towels I had hung up and the toiletries, they did NOT clean anything. The bottom of the toilet had something on it and it was there our entire stay."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Arrived after a long day fishing...it was hot and we were hot and sticky. Our room was cool, super clean and smelled divine! Thank you Hampton Inn....can always rely on you! Great that there is a Sarasota Ale house across the car park which has amazing food! Breakfast as usual is included and plentiful."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"arrived at 9:pm, slept,left in the morning"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Great stay! Very nice employees at the front desk breakfast area. Rooms were big enough for 4 adults, and the breakfast was really nice! (make your own waffles, hard boiled eggs, omelets, sausage links, asst breads, oatmeal, cereal, asst fruit, coffee, tea, juice."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,A very comfortable stay
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Sadly, this hotel has gone down hill as the Hilton brand continues to cut corners across its lesser brand lines. What once was a respectable hotel for weekend getaways to Siesta Key, has become a bug infested, carelessly managed, pathetic excuse for a hotel. We checked in this past weekend for a three day getaway utilizing our Hilton award points.... More"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Stayed at same hotel 3 times. This time the room smelled of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Fortunately we won't need to use this facility again. It is my hope on behalf of other travelers that Hilton will invest in this property and fix it up from stem to stern. From the unkept parking lot to the smelly hallways to the poorly functioning bathrooms. What is there to say about the pool might need someone to check... More
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"The staff was great. The selection of rooms is slim 3-4 basic type rooms (no suites). The location is good several shopping centers nearby. The breakfast is lacking in variety. Overall, it is a good hotel."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Our family of four stayed at this new location at the end of June. Very easily located, right off the interstate (Exit 214) and close to the new UTC Mall and plenty of other retail shopping and restaurants. Although close to the interstate, the rooms were quiet. The hotel is in a very safe section of town, is very clean,... More"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Room was dirty sheets did not look clean at all! House keeper spent more time on her cell phone than she did cleaning her rooms, did not clean our bathroom or leave us clean towels. Will not stay their again, staff did not care."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Hotel was very nice. Great location of I-75. Nice pool and exercise room. The complimentary breakfast was very nice. The lobby area has a huge sitting area where you can relax with friends and family and watch tv, play cards or just catch up."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Service was terrible I forget a pair of new gim shoes I come back to hotel 5 days later asking for my shoes and I as to 5 diferent People in reception and nobody gave me an answer
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The facility was very nice but it is a partial smoking hotel. When you walked in you can smell the smoke. My room though was a non-smoking room and it was comfortable and smoke-smell free.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"This hotel knows how to maintain you happy and comfortable. The front desk's personnel is friendly and helpful. Awesome experience. Brandon was our front desk clerk, and he was exceptional with a friendly attitude and always smiling. He truly wants to help people. If every hotel looked to have personnel like him, all hotels would be better, just for that... More"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,I was affordable and close to where we wanted to visit
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"This poor old place is ready to be retired. Managers were all very nice but desk people were unaware of price differences, discounts for bereavement or Government ID holders. The truth is that..even in Florida in February..the hotels are all way overpriced, but this particular Hampton Inn does not deliver a 228.00 value. Nor does it seem to deliver a... More"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Staff was great and accommodating. It's a good location if you do not care that you are not staying by the beach. The hotel is older, but the rooms are clean. The room did not have a real closet, but there was a rack with hanger and a some shelves behind a curtain. We didn't realize that at first. The free breakfast was fine. Again, nothing fancy. But, there were fresh fruit and waffles and a good selection of other items. We were given a room with a handicap-accessible shower. There was only a tiny shelf in the shower and very little counter space. The bed was hard very hard. It was not comfortable at all. The sheets were not fitted, so the sheets came undone during the night. We did not have a chance to use the pool."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Good amenties. Breakfast was also very good.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Registered and was not told there was no water in any room! Water did come back, but in the morning the pipes sounded like they pipes were going to explode. Ran out of hot water by the time I had to shave. Sad that this is happening without any major repairs going on at the hotel. It needs some major attention to getting this resolved!"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"I do not recommend staying here. The hotel smells like mold, the staff was not helpful at all. The room was even worse. Hairs on the tub, mold around the tub. horrible experience for my family and I."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"As commented by others some areas are dated but everything was clean and the beds were great, good nights sleep while driving 1300 miles. Staff very helpful and I loved talking to Rosie the breakfast lady, she was friendly, sweet hard working lady. Breakfast fell a little short. Pre-made omelet and sausage seemed of marginal quality. Great location off of... More"

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Carpet needs to be upgraded along with the bathroom fixtures. Water pressure in the shower was weak. Also, better quality towels would have been appreciated. Overall for the price of 130 for the night this was an average hotel experience."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The hotel did not stand behind its price match guarantee that they advertise. That was disappointing and left us feeling mislead .
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Clean, great location- near I-75, near beaches, shopping Mall, restaurants etc. great price, breakfast was great, staff taking care of breakfast worked very hard to accomindate the customer, very nice stay!

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Close to places to eat . Close for sightseeing . Helpful staff . Great breakfast .

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Overall good stay, they gave us grief for trying to have later check out of 1...ended up leaving by noon anyways."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Went there because of Hurricane Mathew. Staff was very helpful. Would stay there again.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"The hotel was fine, especially the smell of chocolate chip cookies as I checked in. Unfortunately they were gone before I could get one. The only issue was minor: the adjustable shower head was not adjustable."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,We had an excellent experience at this Hampton. Front desk was very helpful and prepared for us. Room was comfortable. Special rate from Priceline was great! Breakfast was easy to access and pleasant.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Front desk was very nice and accommodating.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Lets just say House keeping needs to be retrained. Our bathroom was not clean on arrival. Then when returned from a day out and about. Our room had received no servicing at all. Front desk was hkepful in getting us fresh towels. Not the level of property we would expect for the pricing of the room.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Clean room/bathroom. Convenient ice machine. Ample parking.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"I can't say enough good about this hotel. From the cleanliness to the helpful, friendly staff to the comfort of the rooms. Easily accessible. When there are choices, it's nice to be assured that one is a sure thing!"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Stayed here with our children for a quick trip to Siesta Beach. About 20 minutes from beach. Friendly staff was willing to accommodate our request for late check out. Breakfast was great. Bathrooms felt a little dirty, but could just be age."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Most of staff not very friendly except Sam which was very helpful and friendly. Food was sub par especially the pastries and the complementary breakfast personal were down right rude at times. The pillows were too small and had no firmness whatsoever I had to use two pillows to get a proper head height.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"We had just arrived back in port from our cruise, due to the weather back home, rather than drive home to hit winter storm Jonas, we decided to drive to Sarasota to visit with my husband's cousin for a couple of days while we waited for the major roadways to be cleared from ice and snow). The hotel is a little older, but the staff was very nice. It was convenient to restaurants and the like."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Bed was hard, pillows were small and fluffy, no support. Poor quality. Resulted in a very restless night. Bathtub was not clean. There were long black hairs in the white tub. very noticeable, and should not have been missed."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"One of the things I value about Hampton Inns is the predictably clean, and well appointed rooms. This place is no different, and was substantially less expensive than many others in the area. And, I really like that there is a good breakfast and hot coffee 24/7. The staff was friendly and helpful too."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,There for spring training. Great place to stay.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,This was a wonderful hotel to stay at! We had 2 rooms and they were both very clean. From the front desk to maintenance to the breakfast staff they were all very professional and friendly. The rooms had excellent water pressure and were very clean. The morning complimentary breakfast was wonderful. Definitely would stay here again.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Great hotel for what we needed it for.Quick check in , clean , refrig in room . Housekeeping was attentive and done early . We are not high maintenance so it was easy and comfortable for our family . I would stay again"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Check in was prompt and uneventful. Breakfast was corporate traveler average with hot and cold selections. A small tray of freshly baked cookies were available for one hour at 5pm. There was a refrigerator, but no microwave, unless you chose to use the one in the lobby breakfast area. Wifi was fine. The side door to the heated pool and spa was adjacent to a smoker's station and often propped so the room keycard security was defeated. The hotel location was very good for access to I-95 and the Beeline Expressway to the Gulf Coast, however evening commuter traffic on the I-95 south of our location was very bad, due to construction, so check traffic websites and plan alternate routes accordingly. We visited several local attractions and drove along the coastline roads to explore the area for a future visit, so this worked well for us."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Very pleasant Quiet convenient location i definitly would recommend The staff told me good places to shop eat movies. Gave great directions Breakfast was hot and good best oastmeal I ever had. beds are extremely comfortable reasonably priced too
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Great hotel Hidden off Main drag Wonderful location Easy on and off road Lots of stores, eats close by Great rooms Good price I would recommend this hotel Great value to know you have Hampton Inn bed to keep in at the end of the day."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"I typically have really good experiences at Hampton/Hilton properties. This one was a little disappointing.

The bed was great though the bedding cover had lipstick stains on... More
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Stayed here for 2 nights and was a great base to explore Sarasota. The room was so nice and the bed, well, I could have stayed in there all day. So comfy. The room and hotel was very clean. Dissapointed by the breakfast offering, but nice touch was offering free coffee and warm cookies throughout the day"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,We had a nice stay at this hotel. The breakfast wasn't very good and the person at the front desk wasn't always around. But the room was nice and had lots of shows/movies. The bed was big and comfortable.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Very clean room lots of space, restaurants around everywhere and close to hwy 75"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The staff was rude and the rooms were uncomfortable. Also it Is hard to sleep with your Air Conditioner constantly going off and on. DO NOT STAY HERE ON YOUR VACATION!!! Very disappointed I have never been so dissatisfied in my life..
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"We rented two rooms for our town guests. They enjoyed their stay but said the air conditioning kept going on and off throughout the night and was noisy, not helpful for good sleeping"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Hotel was being renovated and I was working at night. I was rudely awakened at about 8:00am to the obnoxious sound of a power tool that went non stop for about an hour
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Easy to get to during long travels, right off of the highway, next to a bunch of shopping malls/plazas and restaurants. Never got to try the breakfast but it smelled amazing. (Never woke up in time for breakfast lol). Everything was very clean and comfortable. Check in and Check out was a breeze."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Hampton Inn provides such ease with every stay. The only complaint (if it's really even a complaint) is the muggy or humid feeling in the hallways. But the service, breakfast buffet, room beds, furniture, access and parking were all really good! The night manager was a sweetheart and on point. I can see him going far with the company, since...

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,This was the first time I stayed at this location. It is close to the freeway and downtown Sarasota. I checked in late and the staff greeted me when I walked in and they had my room ready and check-in was fast. The rooms are very clean and fresh. The staff was great. I would stay at this location again.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Front Desk Staff great job!!!! Very fast and courteous. Room was awful...Dusty, dirty, carpet awful. Paid way too much money for a room like this. Really time to remodel this hotel to meet Hilton guest expectations expecially if they are going to charge top pricing"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Always a very clean and well attended hotel to stay at! Very nice staff and always attentive to your needs. I have traveled through Sarasota many times and it is always the place of choice. Great Location and great food in the area off Bee Ridge.

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The hotel staff was great very courteous. Close proximity to this beach without paying the high prices.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"This is what you would expect for a facility near the interstate. Surprisingly quiet rooms with restaurants nearby. Nothing fancy, but a decent place to stay. Good breakfast selections. Small pool. Rooms are typical. Decent beds. nice TV."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,I used to stay here all the time. The Manager was great. Then they had some turnover and seemed to go down hill. Now they have remodeled and seem to have a stable staff again. They treat me like family. Very welcoming and helpful. Brandon is great!
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Hotel took notice of the little extras. Shower head had changing speeds. Shower curtain bowed out for extra room. Lobby smelled of fresh cookies. Breakfast seating comfortable and well maintained. Staff perhaps the friendliest I've had. Hotel surroundings busy and pool by parking lot, but it was a nice area and nice pool. Every restaurant, shop, and gas, right there. Very busy exit but was easy in and out."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,It was a nice hotel. I have one complaint. I am a smoker as is my husband but the thickness of smoke was horrible. All they have to do is use some Fabreeze every time they clean it. For that I would not stay there again.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,We were able to book a very good deal via hotels.com and one of there daily deals. Our service was excellent. The room was clean and well maintained. Just off the highway so it met our needs for this trip.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Hotel was average. A little hard to find. Madfish Grill Restaurant nearby was pretty good. Our experience will be remembered as the Hotel where the maid kept my earrings I left in the room. So be careful not to forget anything!!!
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Thank you for good stay
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The room was clean and service was great. They had a pretty good breakfast in the morning as well. The only thing which was probably out of their control the jacuzzi by the pool with not working due to a storm passing through. But the pool is clean and feeling good. I would definitely stay here again.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"We didn't have any real complaints staying here. Its an average hotel. Great location, clean pool. They have fresh waffles, which was good. Decent coffee. The only thing I noticed was some ants and dirt in the bathtub."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The breakfast was good. The bathroom sink did not drain well. The bathtub area had mildew along the edges of the bathtub.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Bad experience for a vacation. Smelly, dirty and not fresh. Not worth your time. I don't know how this hotel is so popular and has a good rating. By experience it's far from good! It should be visited by health inspectors!"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"This hotel definitely falls short of Hampton standards in several areas. Location - Quite convenient. Right off I-75. close to restaurants, stores. 25 minutes drive to Siesta Key beaches and Lido beaches. Personnel/check in - Average. Overall appearance - The hotel is old and worn out and needs updating. The carpets are worn out and seem dirty. Carpets in some areas of our room were ripped. The restroom in the lobby area was disgusting and worse than a public restroom!! Totally unacceptable. Beds - Acceptable, comfortable. Bathrooms- The bathrooms need to be cleaner. There was mold on the shower curtain on the inside. Water temps and pressure was acceptable. Room - Room lacked storage. No drawers to store belongings. They do have a couple of shelves but are not adequate. Breakfast - Area is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. Inadequate seating in area. Breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized. Quality of breakfast items is below average than the Hamptons I have been in in the past. Number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to keep up. Juice was watered down including Florida orange juice!! Pool and hot tub - This was good and well maintained and we used it a lot. In general this Hampton falls short in many areas and I do not recommend it."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,The bathroom has no vent so the room totally fogs up when showering. The rooms seem small but adequate. The breakfast was lousy. Has anyone from Hampton eaten those eggs The staff was fantastic
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Indifferent staff, filthy gross bathrooms and antiquated TV service. Seemed to be an inconvenience to front desk staff. Mold a mildew buildup in bathrooms (would love to share the photos) and Stanley Cup Finals unavailable."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Our stays at Hampton are generally good. This no exception.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,We were not that happy at this Hampton Inn as we are at many others we have stayed at. Our maid service was not good they missed our room two days in a row to clean. The pool was dirty never saw anyone cleaning the bottom only skimming the top. The grounds and building need a lot of work as well. It was comfortable and the staff at the desk were nice and so were the staff making the breakfast.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"Stayed here just for one night. The hotel is in a nice area and it's in decent shape. The lobby was nice with TV's and coffee all day.

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Good location.
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"I stayed here once a couple of years ago. At that time, my room stank like someone had cooked hamburgers or steak, (kind of a greasy like odor, hard to put my finger on it), the window shades/treatments were cheap vinyl and the room generally looked dated. I stayed there this past week for a company meeting and was dreading... More"
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Don't stay here. Unsafe. Housekeeping will allow anyone into your room. Doors were propped open for days. This included empty and occupied rooms. There were bugs around the sink and the tub would take forever to drain. There was a problem with the water temperature. All I got was hot water so taking a bath was rough. Food was OK.... More

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"We stopped here for a night on a road trip- the hotel was clean, the staff were fine.

Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,"We were on our way to a family event in St. Pete Beach, and the property is very convenient to I-75 (but didn't experience any highway noise) - we drove down to St. Armand's Circle and had a wonderful dinner. The king room was very nicely appointed and the bed was very comfy."
Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,Very good Hampton Inn. Check in was quick. WiFi has good speed with good coverage in the hotel. Cookies in the evening. If you are a road warrior and tired of the usual breakfast that is served in the morning there is a nice cafe called First Watch that is a short walk that serves a nice breakfast.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"The hotel was partially renovated, but the room wad not clean. There were ants everywhere, on the desk, on the walls, on the night tables... The bed mattress was blood stained. We had reserved for four nights, but checked out the first morning."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Hotel us old. Carpets filthy, couch and chair cushions nasty. I hated staying there. La Quinta is off my list."

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Hotel staff was outstanding. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom and sink area were not cleaned. Hair on walls, hair in sink, hair in tub, hair on soap dish. It was pretty gross. I was too tired to deal with it when I checked in, so I didn't complain while I was there, but definitely put a damper on an otherwise great stay. They let me have a late check out with no fuss, which was really nice since I was in town for a race and the drive back to Orlando was much more pleasant after getting clean. A little quality control check on the cleaning folks would got a long way toward the overall quality of my ratings toward this hotel."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Arrived and the elevator was broken. My wife has a bad knee and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor to get to our room. Nobody offered to help us carry our luggage or provided any type of amenities for the inconvenience. Not what we expected from a La Quinta property.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"We checked in for one night to go to a concert at the BBT Center. Immediately got up to the 4th floor and could smell cigarettes. Got into the room and the smell was even worse. Called the front desk to see if we could get our room switched, but were told that the resort was sold out for the night. Thankfully we didn't stay in the room long, as we had our concert to go to. Thankfully we had enough to drink at the concert to sleep through the disgusting smell. Who allows smoking in rooms anymore Time to upgrade your client base and refurbish that floor and the hotel to non-smoking. I had to wash even my clean clothes, just to get the smell out of them. The pillows and towels even smelled. It is just gross... Continental breakfast in the morning was decent. About the only nice thing I can say about the hotel."

But it was a nice room, nicely decorated.... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Ok. Cigarette smell.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"We had dead ants in the room. Told the front desk and they offered to chug rooms. We were all unpacked, so we declined. The front desk said she would make sure it was cleaned up, but the dead ants were in the same place. Also beds not made one day."

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"The staff was friendly, the room was comfortable and the surrounding area had restaurants, Starbucks within walking distance."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Gas always I loved everything about the hotel. The only thing I would change is the speed of the wireless. I enjoy the breakfast and pool area the most when working remotely. The staff is very nice and maids do a great job in cleaning the rooms.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Good stay, exactly behind the Ikea Sunrise, which was easy for us for dinner. Nice hotel near the highway. Spacious room with all the amenities. Breakfast is okay. Could have more variety in spreads for bread but it is okay."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Carpets are chocolate in color but one can still see the dirt. Bed was so too soft. AC went to sleep mode. Unable to clear that mode on the wall mounted thermostat. Breakfast was the same old-same old. Not one simple special dish or sample from south Florida's cuisine.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"When I got there I was informed by the guy at the front desk, Nathan, that my room with a king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available. Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Hotel was nice overall but we had an issue with our tv remote. It had to be replaced but was done so promptly. Housekeeping in the halls were a little noisy in the morning but other then that it was pleasant. Very comfortable beds.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Good stay, great price..."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"We chose this hotel for the price and the location close to the Sawgrass Mall, both met our expectation. The room was spacious, bed was comfortable. Didn't have business center, however I got my boarding pass printed out by emailing it to the front desk, so that didn't matter much. We stayed in Room314, and it smelled like a smoking room. That bothered me a little. But other than that, We enjoyed our stay."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"This is the second La Quinta that I've stayed in in the Fort Lauderdale area.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Our stay was nice. The front desk staff was always pleasant. The breakfast was not as good as other La Quinta Inns. It was always a mess when you went to breakfast. There was not enough space for the breakfast room.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"It appeared every effort was made to be substandard, five staff members standing together when I walked through and no one addressed me. Decor can only be described as yard sale chic. Cats running around the parking lot. My advice, find another hotel!"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"The rooms are big and clean with fridge and microwave and wifi. There is a nice pool at a small lake. The breakfast is good with hot waffles, cooked eggs, muffins, bagels and much more. The staff was friendly. The Hotel is close to Sawgras Mills."

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Disappointed that because I booked through Hotels.com, I could not use my military discount, which was providing better rates in the greater Miami area. Breakfast offerings good, but serving area was a narrow room with minimal seating. We were there on a weekend. It was difficult to get close to the food. Both mornings I had to take my plate back to the room which was fortunately not a long walk. Room was very good, comfortable bed. Hotel was very convenient to Butterfly World and Markham Recreational Park- two sightseeing goals. My husband was distressed that the grounds around the hotel were littered with trash when we checked in and same trash still there two days later on checkout."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Loved our room and the location of the hotel! Close to everything we needed and more!!
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"With tax, 199. Definitely not worth it."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"The front desk staff was very friendly when I arrived (although I did encounter someone standing at the front desk who said they'd been there for 10 minutes without assistance as I was leaving one night). The cleaning staff was not as friendly. As I was standing by the elevator with my bags to leave, one of the cleaning staff demanded I show her which room I was exiting, taking so long that I missed the elevator. I found that very odd and rude. There was also a lot of noise in this hotel. I heard doors slamming and people talking until 2am. I also smelled smoke the entire time I was there. I'm not sure if it was coming from the vent in my bathroom or people walking down the hall. It was very strong in the stairwells (which I took when I could because the elevator was so slow)."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Average Hotel. Expensive for the quality. I will not recommend it. Accept pets. It is near Sawgrass Mills.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Please provide proper maintenance to bathroom, provide decent cleaning services to the rooms specially to the carpet, please fix the air conditioning and replace that stinky carpet.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"It was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in the room. Also front desk staff was good. Efficient and friendly, and therefore cannot be faulted. The facility was horrible and that's where the low rating comes from. The room was rumpled looking, like it was hastily cleaned. The carpet had a damp feel to it so wear... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"A La Quinta next door to a La Quinta! Sounds crazy, but it works!

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Pleasant hotel with nice room and ok breakfast. Very handy for visit to Sawgrass Mills outlets. However difficult to locate with poor signage and confusing to find at first another La Quinta hotel practically next door. It was pouring with rain when we arrived at the wrong hotel but the receptionist seemed to think our confusion was funny ! Excellent... More
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,This place needs active management. This place is horrible trash everywhere . Carts left out. Very run down in the rooms. Looks nice outside except for trash over flowing cans out front. Carpets stained and smell. And the air dosent work very good. The waffle maker not cleaned and just thrown on a shelf. JUST HORRIBLE!!!
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Very happy with this hotel. It was basic and clean and we booked this as a one-night hotel stay the day before our cruise the next day. Close enough to the cruise port but also very close to Sawgrass Mills mall, which we took advantage of that evening. Very happy with free breakfast and the friendliness of staff and cleanliness...

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Is good but can to be better. I travel frequently to the US and I like to stay in the fifth but I want improve and they can do. Earlier the breakfast was much better. My first stay in La Quinta was in Miami and the breakfasts were exelentes. Please, just do it."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"The free breakfast buffet was ok, could have been set up better and better organized. It was very hectic trying to get breakfast."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"It was not at all a pleasant stay, the breakfast consisted of stale bagels and horrible coffee, the carpets were dirty."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,In town for a funeral and only needed an overnight stay. Rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. Coffee and danish and waffles for breakfast. Would stay there again. Easy to get to off the expressway.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Good stay, quite place, excellent location, improve bathrooms and improve breakfast. The elevator must have maintenance and actualization for a newer one. The toilets must have a more conformable way of working, and the noise of the extractor is too loud."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Booked this hotel based on it's location to the Sawgrass Mills mall. Was very disappointed. Front staff were friendly and helpful - we were able to check in early but the hotel was dirty - cobwebs in the lobby area and our room. The elevator was dirty as were the floors. Our room had a terrible odor and the carpet... More

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Never again
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,We checked into this hotel because it was pet friendly. We were treated extremely well including our dog. The hotel is in a quiet area but close to the BBT centre along with Sawgrass Mills for shopping. The staff was awesome which made the stay enjoyable. I would highly recommend this hotel.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Very good!

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"I have stayed in many La Quinta's and this one has been the cleanest and most friendly.

Also, they are dog friendly! This is the main reason... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Average, basic, simple hotel. Staff was pleasant. Price was good. Location was great. As we were attending a concert at BB T, then planned to do some shopping the following day at Sawgrass Mills and IKEA. And those attractions are all within 2 miles, or so, of the hotel. And don't be confused, there are 2 La Quinta Inns across the street from another in this area."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,definitely use wake up call service. i was here for two weeks and every other day there was a power surge that shut off the tv and reset the microwave and clock radio.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Ideally located next to Sawgrass mills mall, this hotel rermains comfortable even if it would need a refreshment. It has a swiming pool, which is pleasant after a day shopping! The breakfast is good. Good value for money."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,It was ok for sleeping but you cannot even move your luggage and the one in the room next is complaining.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"They overbook then lie about it and then have no rooms available at the time they tell you to come back for your room. Horrible experience with this property, will never book with La Quinta again, anywhere."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,Usually La Quinta is a good chain. I found this one lacking. There was construction going on in the lobby so maybe they are updating I'm not sure. There was an ozone machine running night and day that gave me a headache. The A/C in our room 301 wasn't working correctly. The elevator took FOREVER to run the three floors.... More

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"Room was clean beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast area was timely, constantly tended to and well kept. Front desk staff was courteous. My children don't eat hard boiled eggs, so personally I would have preferred if scrambled eggs were also available at breakfast. Still, the juice, cereal, waffles, toast, coffee, muffins and other items were tasty. Easy access to main roads and highways. Close to malls, Ikea, restaurants and other local sites of interest. Overall a nice stay and we would enjoy returning."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"We stayed at this hotel on 2013 and 2014. The best is the location of the hotel if you go to Miami for shopping. The very bad is internet access, this is not high speed as advertised on hotel website and definitely they have to improve breakfast service."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"the only issue with this place is that there are 2 La Quinta hotels side by side, same side of the street. only separated by a small street. but if you are not from around there, you could easily go to the wrong one.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"I stayed for a third occasion in this La Quinta and, as the first time, the experience was very good. This is a very quiet, nice hotel. Every time I've stayed here has been a very positive experience. I certainly expect to come back when I return to Fort Lauderdale. It is like a home outside of home."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,"There are 2 locations side by side. Be sure and pick the better one if you can. I'm in the 13651 and that's old and dumpy. I like the desk lamp that can't be turned off/on unless you plug it in! Lol... This is a nice area, very safe and quick on/off to 595/75."

Elk Springs Resort,Well worth it! This was our first condo rental and we couldn't be more pleased. We have 3 kids and wanted something more than a hotel. It was roomy and comfortable with 2 bedrooms and a sleeper couch. Sure beats trying to find a hotel with room for five. The condo was very clean and well kept. It felt like being at home. Kids liked the pool and there were baby ducks that came up from the river there everyday. TV's in every room so the kids didn't fight over what to watch. Master bedroom was fantastic with a jacuzzi tub. Location was convenient and Elk Springs was responsive to any needs we had. We look forward to trying one of the cabins next time as a change of pace.
Elk Springs Resort,"Cabin was great and as described. Hot tub wonderful. My only complaints are minor. The wireless internet was not repaired even 4 phone calls requesting help. I thought for the price of the cabin, more than one roll of toilet paper could be supplied and beware of fees Nonrefundable damage waiver fee 45.00, Cleaning fee 45.00 for 1 bedroom cabin... More"

Elk Springs Resort,Loved it! We stayed there over the Labor Day weekend. It was a perfect home away from home. Didn't leave the Chalet for 2 1/2 days. We want to go back when it snows and we will go back to the same rental. Continue making memories where we already feel at home. Thanks for everything to the Staff. A great experience all around.
Elk Springs Resort,Absolutely perfect!! We stayed in Knotty Pine Delight. The cabin was clean and was even better in person then the pictures on the website! Check in was a breeze. We loved the location. Cabin was fully stocked. It was so beautiful that the kids wanted to stay in the cabin rather then go into Gatlinburg. We will definitely be back!!
Elk Springs Resort,We stayed for 5 nights in the This Magic Moment cabin located in Cobbly Nob. It wasn't in the main area of Elk Springs but we were aware of that ahead of time.

Elk Springs Resort,"I used a Groupon and stayed 2 nights with a group of 6 people at the Deer To My Heart cabin which supposedly sleeps 9 people. It was decently secluded, but the steep dirt road made it hard to drive up to the cabin. There were some extra fees for cleaning and such when the nights were reserved. The total... More"

The spa was really nice after days spent trekking in nearby Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The staff at Elk Springs were polite and made sure in a non intrusive way that our needs were met and we were happy. We cannot wait to come back next year!!"

Elk Springs Resort,We visited Gatlinburg for a week in October. It was our honeymoon and we were using it for rest and relaxation as we have previously been. The cabin we rented was Mountain Splash.

A 5 bedroom, 4 bath cabin with so many amenities that we immediately felt comfortable and at home. Rocking chairs on the porch for snacks and drinks, and a fully equipped kitchen which we used to prepare several breakfasts and dinners. Evenings in the media room for movies, we will definitely be back !!"
Elk Springs Resort,"Check-in was a little early than standard check-in time so it was good. Everything is so clean. Kitchen is fully equiped (baking dish, blender...). Bathroom: plenty of towels. For washer and dryer, you might need to bring more detergent if you wash more than one load."

Elk Springs Resort,"Disappointed with this cabin. Pictures on site oversold it. Too close to other cabins, no mountain view at all. Trouble with tv. It was clean, easy to get to and convenient to all the attractions. In the art district - that was nice. Have stayed at other cabins through Elk Springs which we liked A LOT more. Just depends on...

Elk Springs Resort,"The cabin was nice but the stove partly worked, couch is broken, and one of the bedrooms had a sour smell. Other than that was a good visit with a fantastic view...we did call leave message about cabin to elk springs about problems just never received call back."
Elk Springs Resort,"Denied access, after fully paid confirmed reservation My problems with this company began in December 2011 when I purchased two Groupon vouchers at 329 each for two nights each. The fine print stated there was an additional fee of 125 for cleaning and insurance per voucher, as well as 12.5 tax. After several days of trying to reach a live person I was able to get a registration clerk who informed me that several of the days I needed were blacked out to Groupon users, as well as certain cabins. This was not listed in the fine print and thus I had to receive a refund on one due to the dates I needed being blacked out. A few days later I called to book for the second voucher and was informed that the additional fees totaled more than 250. I explained what my voucher said, and that my fees should total 181.75 per the Groupon. The clerk refused to budge and also refused to allow me to speak with a member of management, stating, the buck stops with me, if you don't want to pay it, get a refund. And hung up on me. I repeatedly tried to call back and as soon as the phone would be picked up it would be hung up. I emailed their website, as well as left comments on the company facebook with the facts I have stated here. Not only did I not receive a response but I was blocked from their facebook. Apparently a glutton for punishment I called once again and got a young man on the phone in their offices and he told me that he would charge my card 189, alot less than 250, but still more than the Groupon states, and that would cover the remaining fees. Imagine my chagrin when I begin receiving past due emails from Elk Springs. I replied with the fact that I had provided my card information and did not wish to sit on hold with them or be hung up on yet again. I received a reply asking if I would like a callback, but before I could reply I received another message stating if I do not want to pay the fees to call Groupon and get a refund. I immediately called the office as soon as I received the message to mhy smartphone, to speak directly with the unprofessional woman I had been corresponding. She of course was out. No longer having any fight left in me, as this was supposed to be a christmas gift to a friend, I paid 194 to finalize my reservations. Keep in mind that this is the 3rd additional fee I had been stated that was different, and still not in line with the Groupon. Now, one week before our trip I finally was able to settle this horrible experience and got a confirmation, paid in full. However, due to the lack of customer service and downright disdain from this company I filed a complaint with the BBB asking that I receive an apology and possibly a small discount after this terrible experience, even before we have arrived. The owner responded by canceling our stay, three days prior to our arrival. I explained to him that it was not my desire to cancel, but that I wanted the lack of service addressed. He refused, stating that he could do whatever I want. I explained, yes, you can do whatever you want, however with three days notice and over 550 tied up and yet to be refunded for the lodging, our family cannot find alternative lodging. Further, in the state of TN there are only 3 reasons an innkeeper can refuse access to someone with a confirmed, fully paid reservation, and a BBB complaint is not one of them. Now my family has all taken vacation time and we have to try and secure lodging in the next two days, and I have to use money that was allocated for travel and activities. I am not sure we will be able to have a vacation due to the malice of this business owner. I do intend to seek further legal action. It is a beautiful property, but it is run by the most unprofessional owner and staff I have ever encountered."
Elk Springs Resort,"Upon arrival the first thing we noticed was it was not a secluded mountain getaway we were told. There are cabins everywhere very close together. Everyone can see you from their porches in the hot tub I was not comfortable with that at all. We have the worst neighbors who yelled, fought, cussed and played music all night. This was... More"

The hospitality was great. Locals were very friendly. We will be staying here again and definitely recommend this place to others.
Elk Springs Resort,"Best Gatlinburg Cabin Rental I just stayed at Elk Springs Resort this past week. Although I am a long time Gatlinburg vacationer, this place was far and above the best resort I have ever been at. The cabins are new, the staff was great, and the location was just 10 minutes outside of Gatlinburg. You never know what you are going to get with some of these cabins, but the cabins at Elk Springs are just like the pictures. Brand new features like theater rooms, saunas, and arcade rooms for the kids. If you don't want to stay near Gatlinburg, they have a number of cabins in other locations as well. The other great thing about these Gatlinburg cabins is that they are not built right on top of each other. Lots of privacy created by the beautiful wooded resort. You have neighbors, just far enough away. Take a 5 minute drive to the national park from the resort or 12 mintues to Dollywood. The perfect location!! I'm coming back to this resort in the summer for sure. I was looking at dates and rates.....July is booking up already."
Elk Springs Resort,"The cabin was beautiful comfortable for our group of 3. We enjoyed the hot tub, fooseball game, deck jacuzzi.

We continued to the very top in this community of colorfully tin-roofed cabins until we reached Almost Heaven! Truly breathtaking views! Everything inside was clean, modern and spacious. Amenities were most delightful and we enjoyed our company around the large dining room table and easily accessible kitchen/grill areas. Two large balconies provided that great Gatlinburg air, peppered with rocking chairs for maximum relaxation! As if we needed to leave this cabin, it is located very close to the downtown area, which is always great for a corn dog and people watching."

Elk Springs Resort,"We stayed in Elk Springs the weekend before Christmas and it was incredible! The cabin was prettier in person than on the site (which I didn't think was possible). My concern was that it would be too commercialized as we used to stay elsewhere - where the cabins were much older. However, we were pleased to have the quiet we were used to experiencing but in a newer cabin, with a ton of room and amenities. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (and I have a Tempurpedic at home)! The kids loved the arcade (prob not as much as my husband and I did once we put them to sleep). We built a fire in the outside firepit and spent time under the starry night. The views were incredible! We will never stay anywhere else!"
Elk Springs Resort,"Beautiful and very peaceful place, I will recommend this place for a family getaway, or to spend Quality time with the person you love, for any especial occasion.

Clean, great customers service, and very relaxing place."
Elk Springs Resort,My family was excited to use the resort amenities that we believed would accompany our cabin rental. It's not a resort. There is no resort.

Elk Springs Resort,We were solicited with a GroupOn offering for a two night stay at Elk Spring Resort. I contacted Elk Spring Resort and was told not to buy one from them but go directly and buy from Elks Spring (which we did)...we were told the offering (249) did not cover the cleaning fee (which was an additional 250+ fee) We provided a credit card and paid for the rental cabin. Our first night there we discovered that we had an infestation of vermin in the cottage. One actually ran across my face in the middle of the night. We were up all night fighting the vermin. We called customer service the next morning. When they arrived they told us this does not happen at their cabins. We found the nest of vermin. Were told to go into the city and they would get their gun and shoot them. I called the office and asked that we be moved. We were told that they did not have another cabin like the one we had paid for so they moved us next door. We were told that they quarantined our original cabin for several days. I called repeatedly and received no answer and no call back. After the 7th or 8th call I did get hold of a reprehensive who told me that they would refund one night (minus the 250+ cleaning fee). I asked to speak to the manger I was told that this would not happen and this was over. I don't think it is unreasonable to have an expectation when you pay 500.00 for two days to have a clean cabin. Can you imagine staying at a hotel...having a room full of vermin and being told that they would come in an shoot them...oh and have to pay a cleaning fee
Elk Springs Resort,"No working refrigerator: / Back in June we had our extended family vacation at Elk Springs Heavenly Heights cabin... To begin our stay they were late giving us our door code, but that was because the air conditioning and refrigerator were both broken. After they completed the maintainance (cleaning the filter and drain pans), the units began to work....we could... More"
Elk Springs Resort,"Everything about our stay was fantastic! We found a deal on Groupon and made the reservation on the Elk Springs website.

We selected A Secret Splash because we wanted a private indoor pool and what a wonderful cabin this was!

Elk Springs Resort,"My family had never been to the Smokey Mountains before.  Elk Springs provides a get what you see luxury approach to cabin rentals.  The pictures on their website are exactly what the cabins look like.  Not only that, most of the cabins are close by so multiple families can share the same experience.  With proximity to everything this is the perfect place for a first time visitor.  Some of the two bedrooms even offer a theater screen."
Elk Springs Resort,We stayed in Elk Springs Resort's Urban Cowboy cabin on April 9th - April 11th 2016. We booked this cabin for a Romantic Getaway. We were very disappointed with this property because they SHUT OFF THE FIREPLACES on April 1st. They must have TURNED OFF THE SAUNA as well because neither of them worked. The Waterfall in the pool did... More
Elk Springs Resort,"Excellent views, new, stocked with everything you could possible want or need. Will be back. Very clean big cabin, teenage sons loved the theater room. Hot tub felt great on snowy day. Will definitely book another trip here, next time in the spring so we can do some atv adventures, rafting and see more wildlife."
Elk Springs Resort,"We stayed in a cabin called above the treetops last week and it was beautiful. The cabin was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. It was convenient and close enough to town but far enough away to enjoy the quietness and beauty of the mountains. We enjoyed the pool table and the hot tub. We will definitely go back."
Elk Springs Resort,Very nice people to work with but I would caution anyone looking to rent that the pictures on the website do not always match the cabins they are renting. We rented Fire In The Sky for Christmas vacation and when we arrived the Air Hockey Table and Pool Table were not the ones they showed on the website and they... More
Elk Springs Resort,My husband and I rented a 1 bedroom cabin which is located ont he edge of the mountain overlooking the mountains. It was absolutly breathtaking. Perfect getaway.

Elk Springs Resort,"We stayed at a cabin with Elk Springs Resort, Cajun Hideaway, in late October this year. The cabin is not on the main resort but was easy to find with the directions given. This was our honeymoon, and we were so glad we chose this cabin. It's high up the mountain and has an amazing view, even from the hot tub! With the changing colors of the leaves, we could not have picked a better time to go! Nice secluded spot and still a close drive to downtown Gatlinburg. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. We definitely plan on staying again!"
Elk Springs Resort,"Very disappointed for the price we paid. This cabin is very average. It isn't the cleanest, the linens aren't great, no privacy inside or out. It stays freezing down stairs, you can hear everyone no matter what room. The blankets smelled like dog from previous guess. The jacuzzi jets have not been cleaned properly. I would not recommend this cabin.... More"

Elk Springs Resort,We spent five nights at Ridgetop Retreat 50 for our 25th Anniversary. We had the most incredible view. Everything was exactly as stated on their website.

Elk Springs Resort,"What a wonderful group of people to work with! When I contacted Elk Springs, they were so helpful in trying to find the best cabin for our needs! I told them exactly what I wanted and they found one that exceeded all of my expectations. It was in a perfect location (I prefer not to be up in the mountains and I enjoy a stream view). It was extremely clean and had every amenity I could ask for! I will definitely use Elk Springs again!"
Elk Springs Resort,"We traveled to the Gatlinburg TN area Oct 28 - Nov 2. We stayed in the Elk Springs Resort, Cozy Bear Ridge cabin. The cabin is not in the main resort, but that was not an issue. The check in/out procedure is very efficient and didn't require a trip to their office. The cabin sits high on a mountain with a view off the front. Three bedrooms with individual baths with a half bath was fantastic. The master suite upstairs was HUGE. The hot tub was relaxing, however the view is limited from the hot tub. The cabin is an easy drive into busy Gatlinburg or back roads into Pigeon Forge. We prefer a location like this - away from the crowds. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to a return visit in the future."
Elk Springs Resort,"We stayed in the cabin named Beary Cozy. Didn't really know what to expect since we booked the cabin days before our trip. It ended up being a awesome cabin.

Elk Springs Resort,"My husband and I love the Smokey Mountains. We have been there many times in the last 36 years beginning with our honeymoon in 1979. We have stayed in a number of places over the years, and we have always been happy with the accommodations. We enjoy every trip, whether by ourselves, or accompanied by kids, grandkids, and friends. We have been using Elk Springs Resort properties for the last few years, since our son-in-law found you on-line. The experiences are always top notch and we are confident we will be happy with whichever one we choose. The discounts help, but the service wins the day!"
Elk Springs Resort,"My family and I stayed at the Silver Creek cabin in Elk Springs Resort. There were 9 adults and 2 babies under 2 years old. The cabin was clean and modern and very comfortable.

Elk Springs Resort,My husband and I came for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. I was so pleased that our Skinny Dipping cabin looked exactly as it was advertised.

Very friendly... More"
Elk Springs Resort,"Very nice cabin for 2. King bed, loft with pool table and jacuzzi, hot tub on deck. Very close to local entrance for the national park. On the quiet side of Gatlinburg on the arts loop but only about 10 minutes from downtown."
Elk Springs Resort,"Our cabin was surrounded by trees with a view and we felt like we were in a luxurious tree house.  Very secluded.  Loved how convenient it was to everything, too.  Elk Springs is close to the trolley stop so we used that often.  Highly recommend it for a romantic getaway."
Elk Springs Resort,"Beautiful luxury rental cabin development near the artist's colony in East Tennessee. Easy access to the Smoky Mountains and the Ripley's Aquarium with a very convenient back road into Dollywood. The cabins are spaced out and each have unique architecture unlike other resorts which are just cookie cutter. Convenient access to grocery stores, restaurants, and downtown Gatlinburg. Many cabins are large enough for two or more families which make it fairly cheap especially when you take into account that you can cook some meals in the kitchen. Also perfect for romantic getaways or a honeymoon.We stayed at the brand new Firefly Lodge and were extremely impressed with the amenities (game room, home theater, private hot tub, amazingly comfortable beds). They're building an on-site indoor pool too. Definitely one of the best places to stay when visiting Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. Highly recommended!"
Elk Springs Resort,We have been using Elk Springs Resort for several years now. The cabin this year was another hit with the families that traveled to the Gatlinburg area. Elk Springs is so easy to work with and they make booking and check in/out a breeze. They are very attentive if any maintenance requests come up and they have a great policy... More
Elk Springs Resort,buckwild cabin is very nice. only bad thing i can see us the thermostat for the a/c system couldn't be changed from 75 degree which made upstairs at night warm
Elk Springs Resort,We really enjoyed our stay. The accommodations were very clean. The beds were super comfy after a very long day. It has all the amenities of your own home. The location was super convenient to downtown Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. I liked the master bedroom was separately upstairs from the guest area and game room downstairs.
Elk Springs Resort,"The views of the mountains was spectacular and the location was close to all the sights. The cabin was great, very spacious and had all the amenities you could want including a full kitchen. I highly recommend this resort."
Elk Springs Resort,"This is my first review on Trip Advisor simply because I don't usually take the time.

Elk Springs Resort,We had a great time loved the cabins! We stayed on the main property. Everything was spotless! Very pleased with the service! They called to check on us after check in!

Elk Springs Resort,"Best Gatlinburg Cabins I cannot say enough positive things about Elk Springs Resort! The location is super convenient, the cabin amenities are first-class, the cleanliness is perfection and the views are amazing. I have stayed in other cabins in Gatlinburg and theirs are by far the best. Whether you are planning a romantic weekend for two or a 10-person trip, they most definitely have a cabin that will meet and exceed your needs. Almost Heaven might be my favorite thus far! I just went last weekend and I cannot wait to plan my next trip...I will absolutely be staying at Elk Springs Resort! Seriously, best Gatlinburg Cabins!!!"
Elk Springs Resort,"We recently stayed at a cabin that is managed by Elk Springs Resort (Smokey Sunrise 53) and I cannot say enough about the cabin being clean, decorated exactly as pictured, view spectacular as advertised. From the moment I booked the cabin the management staff kept me apprised usually on a weekly basis regarding check in procedures, directions to the cabin, things to do around the area and even called the day of check in to tell us our cabin was ready early and give us our code to enter the cabin. We absolutely loved our three day stay and next time will be extending it for two additional days. Carolyn H"
Elk Springs Resort,My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Urban Cowboy with Elk Springs Resort. We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary at the Urban Cowboy. The cabin was absolutely perfect.

Elk Springs Resort,We went exactly at the fall ...so had wonderful view and picturesque breathtaking experience at the hotel.. Clean comfortable with all the comfort and located close to all the places to visit in both Smoky and Pigeon Forge ... Loved it
Elk Springs Resort,"we took our first 'adult family vacation' this past week....3 adult couples, 2 preschoolers. we stayed in ALMOST HEAVEN, and it was perfect for all of our needs -- 2 bedrooms and one bathroom on the top floor, one bedroom and bathroom on the main floor, one bedroom and small bathroom on the lower, game room floor. this cabin is at a very high point in the complex and we had such a nice view of the area, plus a mountain view. the complex is probably 8 minutes from the main drag of gatlinburg, 5 minutes from THE grocery store, 3 minutes from the 'art community'. we had a maintenance problem that was handled within two hours. if we are able to return, i would certainly contact ELK SPRINGS RESORT. that's a no brainer."
Elk Springs Resort,We had a wonderful visit to Breathtaking Views cabin. It was all we expected. A few tips: the road up to the cabin was very steep. Our van did fine but we did not have heavy rain or snow. The cabins are somewhat tight together but not more than a normal neighborhood. You are not completely remote but you can... More
Elk Springs Resort,"We are extremely disappointed in this company.

Elk Springs Resort,We stayed at Elk Springs Resort for the week of Thanksgiving. This was our first time with this resort and will not be our last. The resort cabin was exactly as advertised (which is rare) and the resort staff and reservations people are great to work with. Everything is in 1st class condition. The place is in a great location with easy access to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. We had about 4 inches of snow and cold conditions which only made the fireplace and hot tub that much more enjoyable. The theater room is very nice. The resort roads were well maintained so we didn't have to worry about driving conditions. This will likely become a family Thanksgiving tradition.
Elk Springs Resort,We truly enjoyed staying at the Elk Springs resort! It was quiet and peaceful and the grounds were well kept. The Cabin itself was amazing! Everything was clean and it was the perfect house for our group. The customer service was very accommodating and helpful as we made a last minute reservation. I highly recommend Elk Springs Resort!!!!
Elk Springs Resort,"We were here for a 2nd time the last weekend of April (we stayed at the Deer to my Heart cabin), and our very first time was back in September (we stayed at Fontana the first time).

Elk Springs Resort,"Best of the Best!!!! My family and I stayed in the Grin Bear It cabin for Christmas and had the best vacation that we have ever had. Everything was PERFECT. The cabin was GORGEOUS. We were booked for 4 days and didn't want to leave, so we added another night once we arrived. The staff at Elk Springs is the most professional and courteous that we have ever worked with. Thank you for a Christmas Vacation that we will always remember and cherish. We will be back soon!!!!"
Elk Springs Resort,"Amazing Vacation in Beautiful Cabin We stayed for a long weekend recently and had such a relaxing time. We had planned to be out and about most of the time by the cabin was so nice, we actually spent most of our time there. It was so nice to get away from our busy lives for a few days and just enjoy each others company. We will definitely be back!"
Elk Springs Resort,"My husband and I stayed at Tree Tops which is in Bearfoot Resort, but managed by Elk Springs Resort. Up until our stay, I received emails to keep me posted on the status of our reservation. I also received a phone call to confirm before Elk Springs charged my credit card for the remainder of our fees. Everyone I spoke to was extremely courteous and professional. The day of our arrival, we received a phone call to let us know the cabin was clean and ready for our arrival, along with information about the door and security codes. After mentioning that our arrival would be well after dark, we arrived at the cabin to find the porch light and most of the interior lights were left on for us. The cabin was absolutely adorable. The two large flat screen televisions were awesome for watching Saturday's games. The kitchen had not only the basics, but good quality cookware and every small appliance we could possibly need to cook meals during our stay. The best part was the views from the two covered porches. Whether grilling out, rocking in the gliders or eating a meal on the upper level porch, the views of Mt. LeConte were breathtaking! On the lower level, we could enjoy the view from the hot tub or swing, which were my personal favorites! This cabin was a little more expensive than some we've stayed in previously, but it was by far the nicest. We agreed that we will definitely be contacting Elk Springs next time we visit the Smokies!"

It's in a great location as your aren't far from anything, fenway, sports bars, restaurants, the station, park and the waterfront to name a few. I stayed in a twin room with a shared bathroom. The rooms... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"One of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a weekend. It is a hostel, so obviously it's not the most beautiful and accommodating place to stay, but I will say it was a lot better than what I thought it would be. We stayed on a relatively warm weekend, so being without AC wasn't as bad... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The reason we chose to stay at 40 Berkeley was for the convenient location (2 blocks from the orange subway line and 30 minute walk to the Boston Common/downtown area) and reasonable price compared to other hotels and hostels in Boston (130/night for room with double bed and shared bathroom). The positive: The location served us well, as we were... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in June. Although I did find it a little expensive for what it was (180 / night), this was one of the least expensive options we could find for staying in Downtown Boston. The rooms were standard, but clean. As many travellers have indicated, the building is dated, so many rooms... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"For the price payed, this hostel is located near a T stop(5 minutes walk) which gives you acces to all the city. Very affordable compared to the hotels downtown. Be sure to ask for a newly renovated room. We got a renovated room(2nd floor, 1full bed). Bed was comfy and room was clean. Lobby staff was welcoming and nice. Would... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This basic spot is definitely worth it if you're travelling on a budget. The place Is large and has a very safe and friendly feel to it. The staff have good local knowledge and are more than happy to spend time with you to explain which sights to see, where to eat and how to get around. It's spotless and... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,This was converted to a budget hotel with no sign of any investment to justify the prices. Beat up furniture in the room. Filthy hall carpets. Shared single sex bathrooms. No air conditioning. Super slow internet. I don't know if the Y is still involved. Someone is making a good profit.
40 Berkeley Hostel,You get what you pay for! It was fine for a stop over it was clean but basic! Rooms are small and quite warm. The staff were all very friendly and helped us plan our trip and we felt our things were safe in our rooms.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Muy lindo el lugar, el personal muy buena onda."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The first surprise was that the rooms do not have their own bathrooms. Be prepared to wander the halls of this place in your towel, and see others doing the same. The shared shower on my floor did not work, so I ended up walking down to another floor to shower. Also, there is no food at all in the... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"When we booked we thought it was a cheap hotel, with shared bath and toilet, but it is not a hotel, it is too basic with no tv in room, no aircon, or other things you expect in a hotel. Then we thought it was a hostel, but it is not that either, since the kitchen facilities are limited to... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,Quiet hours are after 10pm

40 Berkeley Hostel,"All in all a good and clean hostel. The rooms provided enough space. The sanitaries were clean for hostel standarts. Unfortunately we had a room with a very loud, clattering air conditioning below which wasn't that good for sleeping."
40 Berkeley Hostel,The hotel is centrally located close to the Bay Village Boston Common. Overall I was not disappointed by this hotel. We felt safe and close to everything we wanted to see. If you are lucky you might get a room with a great view like we did. Pros: Relatively cheap hotel 130 per night vs the 350 average in... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,Stay here.

40 Berkeley Hostel,"The hostel is cool and offers good services such as pool tables, cinema rooms and a large lounge. However one of the two showers of my floor was broken and the corridors stink a little bit."
40 Berkeley Hostel,I was booked in this hostel for two nights. Room was so so and the bed was rough (well I did not expect anything good from it). I had a long day and found out I could not sleep well every night because of this. The bathroom was so far away from my room. The guy at the reception was... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"My second time staying there, the location is great. But looks like is more like a nurse home, or I can't even describe, my last time staying there was just couple weeks ago, and not even breakfast they offer anymore. When u pay US 100.00 plus tax to be in a hostel where u have to share bathrooms u expect... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Horrible experience at 40 Berkeley. The room was not clean, sheets severely stained and mattress in a plastic cover. The shared bathroom facilities were also very dirty and messy and did not seem to be cleaned on a regular basis. Due to no A.C. the room was incredibly hot. Although we had a ceiling fan which helped marginally, it was... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Cheap as far as boston in concerned. Clean, good location, helpful staff. The heater wouldnt turn off though which was extreemly annoying. They gave us direction which we followed but it would not turn off. Bed was ok."
40 Berkeley Hostel,A good place to stay if you don't mind going down the hall for a bathroom. Definitely a 'student housing/hostel' type place but it's in a great neighborhood easy to get to from Back Bay T. Rooms very basic no AC.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Had to stay overnight in Boston, because of flight schedule. Hotels were sold out or over 300 a nite, so we tried 40 Berkeley. This was our first hostel experience and other than no air and just a ceiling fan in hot weather, it went well. The room was clean, comfortable bed and soft sheets, and bathroom convenient and clean.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We had one night here. It was beyond our expectations. Very cosy atmosphere, spacious room, good service, clean overall, nice garden. Good location! A hidden gem in the city :-) We will recommend it for everyone and will absolut stay here another time in Boston."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"All in whole it was a great hostel! Very clean, which was important for us. Very nice facilities and quite central (about 15 Min walk to the very center). Also the staff is helpful and friendly. The only thing is that our room was quite old (the furniture and so on). But besides that: it's a great place to stay."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Unfortunately I have to say that the staff was not very motivated and not helpful at all. When booking my stay, I asked for advice about parking as I was bringing a car. I never got an answer to that question. Two my email 3 days before my stay I also got no answer. Finally on the day of my... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in early august. I did not book this myself, but a hostel on itself isn't always that bad. We got a bit dissapointed though.

40 Berkeley Hostel,"Best way to make a reservation is directly on the 40Berkeley website rather than a 'third party' such as hostel-bookers which works out cheaper and more reliable.

The staff though may not know about them... make sure you consult google / yelp to find out what is around. WiFi is free, which is a great plus. There is a water station... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Price value is not true, not clean, here is exploited, that there is no comparably priced accommodations in Boston! You sleeping on old camping beds with innerspring. Everything seemed dingy except the entrance area."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This property is a little dated. it is after all a hostel so you get what you pay for. They do have some convenient features: pool tables, wifi, water filling station, and a wonderful outdoor lounging area. Rooms are average, but the shared bathrooms are pretty good. Many things in need of an update, but location is good."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Went there for one night with friends and we booked a 4 bedroom's room for ourself. The location of the hostel is good and at the reception the stuff was fairly nice. However, the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean. Moreover, at night it gets extremely noisy and incredibly hot (the room had no air conditioning). Had difficulty... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,So it's cheap and clean enough. The bathrooms are nicely remodeled. Our room felt very dorm-y and cold. They don't serve breakfast anymore.

Close to everything including coffee and restaruants plus plus plus. Just being in the lobby and the garden is nice.We will go again."
40 Berkeley Hostel,Do not even try to eat the breakfast. Start your day right by finding something outside.
40 Berkeley Hostel,I stayed for a week at 40 Berkeley as I have to attend conference at Harvard. The room is reasonable. The breakfast is very good for a hostel. The subway is 5 mins walking distance. The chinatown is 2 stops away. Helpful staff.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Room was cold, pillow sucked. Jack hammers and traffic on the street could be heard around the clock. Cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning which was so loud I couldn't sleep. Front desk staff were on their phones or talking amongst themselves rather than engaging with customers."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Really recommend this hostel. Good amenities, nice staff. Neighbourhood is quiet and cute. Rooms are basic but clean. Affordable rates."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This is a basic hostel, not a hotel. Therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting ourselves into. The reason we chose to stay at 40 Berkley was due to the fact all other hotels were either booked up or exorbitantly over priced. The room we a private room which a shared bathroom. The set up...

The room was simple and... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,If you don't like the food down stairs they ALWAYS have burgers that they will cook to order just ask. It takes about 10-15 minutes though
40 Berkeley Hostel,"It's a hostel so we were not expecting much and that's what we got. Six days was a bit much to deal with a not great mattress and sub par water pressure in the shower.

40 Berkeley Hostel,Very nice place!
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We arrived at 40 Berkeley in the middle of October for a one night stay.

Check in staff were good, although the first thing that struck us was the number of... More"

In fact, you might just use that as incentive for getting out and sightseeing in Boston...not that you need any outside encouragement.

40 Berkeley Hostel,I booked about 4 weeks in advance and a single room with shared bathroom took about 100 USD/night. Good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the room and the level of cleanliness - I have seen overcrowded youth hostels with similar standards for 1/3 of the price. Overall pretty sad...
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We usually stay in hotels, but I couldn't find anything in our price range in Boston so we chose 40 Berkeley. It was our first time staying at a hostel so we were a bit nervous.

Parking is an issue but they have arrangements for reasonably affordable parking about 10 mins walk away! Wifi signal is a bit intermittent. Main downfall is lack of self catering facilities. Not really any refrigeration available, no breakfast and very... More"

40 Berkeley Hostel,The location is quite good. But the room for three was small and not very comfortable. No AC and it was very hot. The common bathrooms are clean. Good for people who don't care about their comfort and are on a tight budget.

I think that's a good price for the start of October, and it's just a 15 minute walk to get to downtown Boston from the hostel. The room is quite basic,... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I stayed here to save some money, but it might have been worth it to pay a bit extra for something nicer.

These things I could... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The hostel is located in a very good place. Quick check-in. The service was average. We got a room on the first floor. Clean, tidy, basic features. The hostel worked free WiFi.

No breakfast now, but the price still appears to be the same (and obviously the evening meal option has gone). All of Boston accommodation is horrendously expensive by European standards, so if it is just for s night or two, then, yes, do stay here... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Room and restrooms were clean, the staff was helpful. Nevertheless, the room were very simple and the hostel wasn't quiet at all. Due to thin door and window you could hear noise from the coridor and from outside all night. The price was quite high for the service they offer, especially in summer."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,this morning sucked I had no refrigerator or microwave no continental breakfast this was not mentioned in the looking unfortunately or we would not have looked there
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I have stayed here multiple times so it is nice enough for the price to keep me coming back. However, I have learned, some of the rooms have a refrigerator and some don't. I'm not sure it that effects the price, but it is something to be aware of it that is important to your stay."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Location was good. Bed ruffles could use a little TLC, a bit stained. Room and Bathroom were Clean, which is a big plus. Just a little more attention to the bed covers and bed ruffles would have been a perk. Will stay here again."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Shower water was not hot.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The staff was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Quiet no harassment near restaurant and stores it was nice only thing was I prefer a bottom floor and was on the third
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"If a person needs just a place to sleep for the night, everything was ok. Only one chair to sit in, not comfortable. Need something besides a wood office chair so a person can relax."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Although the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the room falls a little short to be excellent. The rooms don't have a refrigerator. The lobby closes early for security reasons. The place is close to a number of Sonoma Valley wineries in Healdsburg and Geyserville and elsewhere. It is reasonably close to Napa Valley as well. Rohnert Park also has one of the few Planet Fitness facilities in the area if you care to work out. When I needed quarters for THEIR own coin operated laundry I had to leave to obtain change. The nearby gas station only parted with 2 in quarters when I needed 5: For soap (1) the washing machine (2) and the dryer (2). Convenient it was not."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I was there on business for a few weeks, rooms seem like they have been renovated since last time I stayed. Room was always clean and smelling fresh. Nice friendly staff. Location is great. Lots of places to eat. Wal-Mart home depot are across the street if in the trades. Gratin casino is with in walking distance."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Bed like sleeping on the ground. Extremely noisy. Ceiling fails to adequately block noise from above. Sounds like a herd of buffalo. Front door not insulated. Ear plugs essential. Water pressure and temp not adequate. Front desk barely friendly, no smiles. Overpriced. 274 for two nights, plus 50 deposit for essentially nothing. No amenities. Outdated. Rating: 1.5."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,It was great especially for the price.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,This place is awful. Beds are uncomfortable and rooms are dirty.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Great for a two night stay. Nothing fancy, but great overall. My only complaint is that the hot water from the sink was not working. The greatest part was their free wifi."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Worst stay ever
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I recently stayed at the Goodnight Inn for a couple of days while on business. I've stayed and reviewed this hotel previously but since the recent updates and continued effort to turn this hotel into the premiere place for travelers and locals alike to stay in comfort and value, I simply had to write this review. I have been a... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Hotel is nice and clean but 182.50 for one night is way too expensive for a hotel that is rather plain and offers no free breakfast or even a coffee pot in the room!
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"For 100 a night I should at least get a whole roll of toilet paper, aND non-smoking room to not smell like smoke."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Too much noise all night long, from de wall, next to the bathroom, I think it come from the laundry room, it has a toboggan."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"This is a basick hotel. The room was clean. Towels are thin and harsh. They did provide shampoo, a continental breakfast, and even a pool. The hotel backs up to the freeway, so the noise in those outside rooms was awful. They provided earplugs, which isn't helpful if you need to hear your alarm. I think if you get an inside courtyard room, you'll be fine and happy you saved a ton of money."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Just needed a place for one night near Sebastopol and Downtown Santa Rosa. This worked well and was nice for what it was
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,My truck was towed away and it cost me 360 to recover it. Also any hotel that offers you complementary ear plugs should be enough of a clue to go anywhere else for the night.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"The Rooms are clean the staff is incredible and accommodating, and its close to my favorite place, The casino! For the Price , its a great little hotel in Sonoma county! Ive noticed the many upgrades happening, fresh Paint New Bed Linens, New Desk chairs! Bravo!"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"If all you need is a place to stay this is good, semi clean room, water was not hot in shower, some bugs in room."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"This motel really doesn't feel safe. The lobby is closed at night with only a small bank teller window to interact with the front desk staff. The parking lot had lots of trash from fast food restaurants next door. My room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it had a huge gap at the bottom through which daylight, and noise passed. The bed was rock hard. The carpet was dirty. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room. The shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height. The elevator interior is just plywood and creaked as the elevator ascended. This motel offers no amenities other than a single bar of soap and a single bottle of shampoo. The motel is in the process of replacing room carpets. There was debris piled everywhere. Construction noise started at 7:30 a.m. each day."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Needed an inexpensive place to stay while daughter was in SSU orientation. This fit the bill. Standard fare. Noise from freeway was present, thin walls/floors. Exterior doors so you hear other patrons entering their rooms, doors closing, etc. Kept the AC/Htr fan on all night to provide 'white' noise. Very nice front desk personnel."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Good place to stay after riding motorcycles all day
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and musty smelling. Next to highway so loud traffic noise. They put ear plugs in the room and acknowledge the problem. Minimal towels and amenities. No hair dryer.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,we where there for work
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Our stay was a quick stay, The room was great in every way. The only objection is the amount of noise from the freeway. Ear plugs were provided though I didn't use them."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Not real impressed by this place, we won't be back"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Ok hotel for one night. Basic room but a step up from Motel 6. Ironing board and fridge in room but no coffee maker. Coffee available in lobby. There's a pool which is nice to cool off however it overlooks a gas station so not very romantic. Would stay again. It's good enough for a one night stay.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Broken outlet, sink stopper did not close (important to contact wearers), and lousy tv reception/selection."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,We literally just slept there! Not too bad!!
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Only stayed there because we wouldn't be spending much time at the hotel. A little expensive for what it is.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The room smelled like a dog kennel. Cleanliness was marginal at best. The price was a total rip off. Enjoy my money because its the last you will ever see.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Nice hotel and priced right. I would stop by and daycare for my business trip going north. Friendly staff very clean room thank you
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,always a great stay. friendly helpful staff. best hotel in Rohnert park. I always stay at this hotel when I'm staying in Rohnert park. the customer service is great and there isn't a better deal in town. close to the free way and casino and shopping.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I wanted a more economical place that was still clean and comfortable. Good night Inn met my expectations and I would stay there again. The staff was generally friendly, receptive and responsive. It really gave me exactly what I was looking for"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Hotel room was very clean stood one night booked the room just to sleep and get ready. The bed was comfortable linen was clean. Hotel is right off the freeway but not too noisy. Bathroom was clean, everything worked in the room. The staff was nice and helpful, parking was free as well as one day of wifi. I would stay here again"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"The hotel is conveniently located with clean comfortable rooms and excellent pricing. The staff is always helpful, especially Sandra who always goes above and beyond for the guests. I have stayed here many times over the past few years, and have never been disappointed."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Good value so much better than Motel 6. Good for one night business stay. Given it's right next to Hwy 101, fairly quiet, but walls a bit thin-could here TV in room next to me. Linens on the bed were good quality and bedding was higher end. Just needed a arm chair to sit in."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Bed sagged in the middle. Woke up with back pain. Room was not vacuumed second day and it needs vacuuming.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Some early morning trucks were VERY loud. There is a reason the room comes with ear plugs.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Have stayed here numerous times. Not the best place but cheap. You get what you pay for. Worked out ok when visiting our son at the university.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Don't stay here. It was horrible. Everything was old. The windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything outside. The hotel is behind a Burger King and Taco Bell, thus you get to hear everyone drive through their drive-thrus all night long. The staff didn't seem to care about anything. The faucet leaked. The TV is in SD and not HD and some of the channels didn't even come in. Overall, I couldn't wait to check out."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Don't stay here.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,This place is pretty shady.. in my room now and a lil bit scared to go to sleep
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"The room was nice. but the check in was inconvenient in that i had to do it from outside and when I walked up there was someone who saw me come to the window but he never got up and acknowledged me, nor was there any doorbell or buzzer to let them know i was there. I had to stand out in the cold and wait till someone else came to check me in. Then that process a bit unorganized and the girl didn't give me my driver's license back and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out. and I only found out then because instead of leaving the keys in the room like I usually do I decided to go to the lobby and check out. They gave me my license then."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"For the price the hotel was above and beyond expections. Great location, comfy beds all you could want when you are just needing a place to crash. Just a heads up if you are not facing the pool, you may want to bring a small fan if you are a light sleeper as the location is convient to everything, it does have the travel noise as well."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Need more than 2 wi-fi access I suggest if family of 4 check in...
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,It was noisy becaue it's too close to freeway
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,We orginally booked this hotel for orientation for Sonoma State University. It was fairly close. Staff was reallly helpful. I would definetly recommend this hotel for anybody that is traveling from a far distance and is on a budget. Probably best deal for a hotel you can get in the area.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I only have 2 beefs with this hotel. First let me state the positives. The location is excellent for visiting the Wine Country - you can be in either valley (Napa or Sonoma) in a matter of minutes. There are many places to choose from to eat, even within walking distance. The room was comfortable and adequate, especially for the... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Close to Sonoma wineries, basic clean room, good value, no frills hotel. Only complaint was the loud freeway noise bring ear plugs!!!"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have to look for a place to eat at 6:00 in the morning. Almost had to stand on the drain hole in the bathtub to take a shower. Water pressure was very low. Glad I didn't have to pay anymore then I did for the room. Would have liked two hand towels instead of just one for two people.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,There's no refrigerator or microwave in the room and the ice machines are far away and the freeway a lot of noise
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"New management made a great change! For a discount property, it was clean and comfortable. We were met by Jonathan and Mariella who were professional, courteous and very friendly. Whatever we asked they had an answer. Definitely worth a revisit"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Yes its on the freeway and Im on the road a lot so I guess the traffic noise doesn't both me!If you want quiet go more inland! The Front desk staff Rocks, cheerful kind, and efficient! And my good luck charm being near the casino! The Room , be it very basic, has been clean all the times Ive stayed... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Very basic, and contrary to what was advertised on Expedia no more free wifi! And box spring is in a plastic wrap, not too reassuring. But seems clean. We're only staying one night."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Did not stay after checking in and finding out about the pools and spa and no 1st floor rooms, only 2nd and 3rd. Elevator broken and no Bell Boy. Drove down the street and got a room for 20.00 cheaper."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We stayed 2 nights. The desk clerk was pleasant with us when we checked in. During the day, workers were cleaning various rooms, but they didn't touch our room. No new towels, beds not touched, nothing. Room was nice - although there were only 2 electrical plugs available (one outlet) - both at the sink and nothing else in the whole room."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"There are other budget hotels in town, however this is our favorite, as it is clean, the beds are comfortable, the staff is extremely friendly, and you feel like you can walk on the carpet and be fine. As opposed to the others........not so nice."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We were glad to have a clean room, close to dining after 12 hours on the road. Thankfully, no negative surprises - just value for my money."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Drove up for the weekend from the bay area to meet my sisters newest Grandchild. We needed a room that was moderate priced. I was so hesitant to book this place after reading all the bad reviews. But there were a lot of good reviews, so I trusted the good ones. Plus with our fixed Senior income, we had to... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Traveling from Santa Rosa to Central Valley. Spent the night to avoid commuter traffic.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I stayed here when I brought my daughter to school at Sonoma State. The only good thing was the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the room. The front desk staff were very nice and efficient. But the room was overpriced for the value. There is free wifi and parking. There was no breakfast included. There were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo. The mattress was hard as a rock I woke up with a sore back each morning. The neighborhood is sketchy and VERY loud. Police were stopping people all the time. The other guests were very loud. And cars went screeching by at all hours of the night. If all you need is a place to sleep, this will suffice. But you can get the same for less elsewhere."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"No hot water in sink. Toilet plugged up, no maintenance person on site, front desk told us to come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I am not sure why the rating for this hotel was low from other travelers but my husband and I were very pleased. The location was perfect for our Wine tours. Walmart was across the street and plenty of places to eat. Good service , bring a travel iron because there is not one in the room but housekeeping will... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,You may want to re-think this decision.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We spent a week here and had an excellent stay. We ended up having to leave before the end of our reservation (my son was transferred to another hospital) and they were very accommodating. Our room was cleaned daily, was reasonably quiet and near shopping and food."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I didn't come here for the view, I could hit the freeway with a rock so to hear it's muffled roar was no surprise nor should it have been (But to hear the power-starved wimp complaining about it at the front desk was!) but at these prices ...the absolute cleanliness in as much as realistically possible was in itself a... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"You get what you pay for, but there was no Good Night here. The place is next to the freeway. Soooo loud! Couldn't sleep! If you're there to get good sleep, go somewhere else. You will hear honking, cars passing, even the police sirens."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Stayed here for a weekend getaway at Sebastopol/Napa. It's a decent solid no frills motel in a very convenient area near shopping, Walmart, food, etc. It's a bit pricey for what you get in terms of amenities (ie no continental breakfast, etc) but is fine for sleeping."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Bed was a little small the a queen some weird people around all night but it was good.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Aside from the endless noise of vehicles, having to upgrade to a deluxe room for a fridge/microwave is malarchy. So basically, I paid 102 for a completely standard room. That's crazy."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"The Good Nite Inn is a clean, comfortable hotel. It is next to a freeway so ask for an inside room to help mitigate the traffic noise. We found the bed a bit too soft for our needs and we wish that there were hooks in the bathroom to hang clothes. The wifi is included. They do put an additional deposit on your credit card above the room cost, so make sure it is reversed before you leave."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Good hotel for the price
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Walk in to room and smells like smoke yet there's a sign stating non smoking room. Found a dead roach near the bed. Light stopped working from the switch, had to turn it on manually."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Reasonable Accomendations for a decent price. Nothing fancy excellent customer service from the staff.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We were in CA for work in San Jose and decided to do a weekend wine country tour. We were staying a an awful Extended Stay America for 200+ per night and found Good Nite Inn for under 80. It turns out the 80 Good Nite Inn was far, far superior to the crummy Extended Stay America. The room was... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"You get what you pay for but this did meet all our basic needs of just a place to sleep coming in late in the evening and leaving the next morning It was a clean but very tight space. We had a room with only a queen bed and this is for a couple! It is by Highway 101, which... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Nice hotel to stay for the price. The room is spacious for 2 queen beds. It's good enough for the family of 4. It wasn't that quiet though because you can hear the people walking and talking in the hallway in the early morning. No complimentary breakfast.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Talk about false advertising. The website makes it look really nice and inviting. However, it's not. The got tub had a tree planted in it so that was disappointing. And the noise was really bad. Motel 6 would have been better."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Awesome as always. Very comfortable atmosphere, which is super important when your with you significant other or family. And for the price.....its easy on the bank account. : )"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"For the price I pay per night, I had a good nite sleep for most of my 5-night stay. Very basic hotel. Bed is comfy. Mostly construction workers who check-in but they are not loud. Rooms are non-smoking which is good. Not too bad."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Good clean rooms great customer service front desk rep was very helpful and nice made me feel very welcome would definitely stay again great service over all very quiet place no interruption from other room enjoyed
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Before booking my room I read some previous reviews I decide to give it a try . When I arrived to the hotel I was shocked with the front desk staff they are amazing there super friendly and accomedating. When I went to the room it was clean they have new furniture and they also have free wifi. The rooms... More
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Check-in was easy, room okay, bed very comfortable. Non-working light bulb/lamb next to bed, called front desk, maintenance no show after being told they would send someone up, no clock, no stopper for tub/shower. Wooden chair had no padding."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I was assured by the very pleasant front desk staff that my room was non-smoking, in fact I signed an agreement that I would not smoke in the room. My room reeked of smoke. It was a mild smell when I first went in so I unpacked and then opened the bathroom door. The bathroom was so awful I could hardly stand to be in there. When I called the desk they said yes they knew. Sorry but they had not control over that. The manager was unapologetic. I have reason to visit Rohnert Park often, but will never stay here again."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"called the night before to request an early check . called in the morning to request early chec in again clerk said they will call when room is available. no one ever called. when we arrived to check in (late night) asked why no one called, the clerk said we were supposed to call. then they put us in a room on the first floor when we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't have any available."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"My impression of this place is that they take full advantage of the idea that this is economy lodging. Any sense of customer service is wholly lacking here, starting with checking in. If you arrive later in the evening, you have to conduct business through a glass window. The guy who waited on us was not at all friendly. I... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Stayed at GoodNite Inn Rohnert Park in July. The room was clean although it could use some updating. The hotel staff was friendly and ever so helpful and my room was quiet and I slept well. The price was a little high for the hotel, but considering the time of year, I was satisfied. The outside grounds were clean and... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Not bad for an inn. Especially for the price
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Rooms are nice had a fridge and nice size tub. Had to use a washcloth as a plug in the tub. Only downfall. The deal I got was 60! Can't beat that! Plus it is right near Scandia so my husband and child could go play whall I worked.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Stayed overnight for a getaway to Graton Casino. Location was very convenient since it is just a long block away. This is a motel not a hotel. It has exterior corridors and thin walls. Traffic noise was considerable but since I am a heavy sleeper, it was not a problem. The room was clean. There are many thrift stores in the area so stopping to browse on the way home was enjoyable."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"A friend and myself just returned from a 3 day stay in this motel. I would rate this an excellent value for the money. Check in and out was very easy, the room was spotless, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and the grounds well kept. To be honest, I simply do not understand the bad reviews of this place....

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Taco bell and burgers right next to this inn
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,You might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable.. Loud constant traffic from the highway. NO sound insulation in the room. All night Taco bell across from the hotel--room shook with truck noise and police pullovers. They leave you ear plugs--still could hear the roar of the highway. Bed was HARD-back... More
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"This place is minimal but just fine!! It's by everything!! Arby's, Chilis, go kart racing, outback!! Was perfect for sleeping & showering. Who wants to stay inside in wine country?"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Really appreciated the cleanliness and comfort. The lady on duty when I checked in was super friendly. Small negatives: the smell of chlorine and a very noisy highway.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"A lot of casino people stay here and if you get a room at the back, prepare for a lot of noise as highway 101 is loud! The room was ok, very basic but new TV and bed was comfortable enough, again for the price I paid."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I had to stay here for 3 weeks while waiting for my apartment to be flipped. I love it here. Great staff, very clean, good area. The hotel is well managed, and I got excellent deals. Each ime the house keeping staff changed our bedding, they arranged my daughters stuffed animals cutely. My girl loved that."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Spent most of our time with family. It was a nice quiet room when we were ready for sleep.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The two queen bedroom is spacious enough for the family of four. The location is good. There is no complimentary breakfast. No microwave or ref in the room. You can hear the footsteps in the walkway in the morning.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Read the reviews and decided to try staying here.First room was creepy,hair in bed ,smelly damp odor and dirty rug.Second room was a bit cleaner but still creepy.We spoke to a policeman patrolling the surrounding parking lot and we expressed our safety concerns . He said they patrol all night and we should be ok.We decided to stay with some... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean, carpet was not very clean but I always wear shoes in hotels anyway. Hot water was hit or miss though. It was in a great area for where we were visiting so we would stay here again. No hair dryers in the rooms, glad I brought mine!"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Just work
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Love it...ideal location.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Hotels in the Sonoma County are amazingly expensive! This hotel delivered what I would have expected - a clean, budget hotel with no frills at a good price. It was a relief to arrive after the ridiculous traffic from SFO airport on a Friday afternoon. If you just need a place to stay the night then this is fine. Good... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,I've been staying in a good night in for more than a couple times I can say the room's there always clean... my kids love staying here because of the pool is never crowded... the staff are so friendly always with a smile... the front desk rocks especially mariela and chely... i recommend this hotel good nite inn
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Use this as jump off point for several regional cities, wine tasting, antique stores. Good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to freeway. Wish for breakfast, but otherwise very good."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Grim little rims that reek of bleach. No amenities.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We stayed 4 nights here. The room was spacious, clean and the bed comfortable. The shower took awhile to get hot. The laundry facilities were great. No fridge which was disappointing but there is an ice machine so that helped. Overhaul we were happy with accom, facilities and surrounding restaurants."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,rude
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Our construction crew has been doing a lot of work in the Sonoma County area and we always stay at the Good Nite Inn. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and it is very close to many of our job sites. We will definitely be back again."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,We spent one night here. Arrived late and just wanted a bed for the night. This place served its purpose. It appears clean and was relatively quiet. There are no AARP or AAA discounts. We thought the room was a little overpriced.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"The place is tidy, the staff professional and polite, and the rooms adequate. I have stayed here about thirty times, and will continue. Ask for a courtyard side room for extra peace and quite! Wifi is not included in the price, but the price is fair."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Housekeeping should read door tags if it says do not display. They still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign was clearly present.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Clean, comfortable, unbeatable price and top notch service that cannot be beat. Every time I have come here I know what to expect and am never disappointed. .They have free internet for up to two devices, plus an option to upgrade to a higher speed/more device. The front desk is always extremely fast, friendly and extremely accommodating. Sandra, Chely, Mariela,... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,It was nasty and stinky
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Motel staff was friendly and helpful. There seemed to be a lot of vagrants but I never felt unsafe. The room definitely needed deeply cleaned. The pool was very nice as the courtyard. I would stay here again as the price was economical.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,This is my first time staying at this hotel. I was very impressed with the staff. They are friendly and willing to go the extra mile for their guests. I recommend Good Nite Inn in Rohnert Park to anyone that is looking for a clean room at a great price.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"A decent, basic, clean, well-organized room. I checked in late and left early. The night clerk was courteous and attentive."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The room was nicer that I thought it was going to be from the look of the hotel. The beds were better than I thought too. The wifi isn't free you pay a daily rate. It was pretty good just for sleeping. I wouldn't hang out at the hotel bc there is not much in it. But overall it was a good experience!
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Awakened in 7:30am by police activity right outside my door couldn't go back to sleep
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"i liked most things about this motel. despite 6 people waiting in line to check in, the desk clerk was very efficient and polite. the grounds and pool looked nice. the room was adequate size and was clean except for a sticky bathroom floor. there was no microwave or fridge, wifi cost 5 a day, there was no breakfast but...

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Would rather sleep in the car. Smells of smoke even in the ""non-smoking"" rooms. Cigarette burns on the bedspread are a dead giveaway. Just spend the extra money and stay somewhere else!"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Convenient location. Noisy. Barely cleanly. Did not sleep well. Traffic noise (highway). Better hotel options very close by. I will not stay there again. Next time I will spring for the Double Tree! PD
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,The room was clean and quiet. The parking lot is well lit and safe. The area is upper middle class
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Nice stay .
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,My stay was great any tidea I needed something the provided it.
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"We stayed for 6 nights. Mostly because of the price and location. We visited Sonoma and Napa primarily and had about a 30-40 minute drive to each. There are also some good breweries within 10 miles. Our favorite was the Cooperage Brewery. PROS Good Location. I got a courtyard room and it was quiet. The bathroom was also clean. Make sure you get a Courtyard Room if you don't want to hear traffic noise all night like I read in other reviews. CONS The carpets needs to be cleaned! After taking my shoes and walking around in the room, I stepped on the towel in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel. Even after showering and washing my feet I would walk barefoot on the carpeted floor and then step on the towel again and black marks again. The bed was a bit hard and small. We reserved a queen but I think they put us in a double. Or somehow my queen bed at home is bigger. The shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to rinse all the soap off and it made my Wife's showers take forever to get her hair washed. I think I'm going to start bringing a shower head and a wrench when I travel. I live in California so our shower heads are already limited. But the hotels go too far. The bathroom towels felt like sand paper, where VERY scratchy, and very small. We ended up just using our beach towels that we had brought."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"Although our stay was short, I was disappointed that there was no hair dryer in the room. However I was impressed w/the quality toilet paper that was provided. Overall, the room was ok at a reasonable price."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"If you only need a place to sleep and you're traveling with a child or by yourself, then it is adequate. I went with my husband to participate in a race the next day, and I didn't get any sleep. The bed was more of a full than a queen and I kept getting woken up every time my husband moved. The room guests next door entered their room so late, and they were slamming doors and talking very loud and one could hear everything. In the early morning, I was trying to take a shower and the shower head was all messed up, so the water accumulated into a puddle outside of the tub and I had to use my towel to soak it up. We had to share a hand towel, also."

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,We stayed here for one night as it was the cheapest way to be close to Sonoma / Napa on a Saturday night.

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for the weekend because I was playing in a local softball tournament and did not want to endure long drives between SF and Forestville.

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Lobby clerk extremely friendly. Rooms are ok -- no fridge and have to walk to lobby if you need ice. The water pressure was terrible for showering. Definately a lot of traffic noise due to 101 but not too bad if you stay on the pool side. Could smell smoke through the vent in the bathroom not sure if from... More
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"This hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay. The room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities. Although there was a small refrigerator, there was no coffee/tea maker. The front desk staff was abrupt and not particularly welcoming."

Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"There were some decent reviews, so we'd thought we'd try it. Ugh. They were totally unwilling to make any accommodations for us. . (We really wanted a first floor room). Room is stark and sparse. The supposed queen size bed is just full size. Only Crummy flat pillows. Filthy chair - and only one. No bedside tables. One bedside lamp.... More"
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,"They didn't clean the room for us (we stayed 2 nights). There was only one partially used roll of toilet paper. The phone in the room was broken and we reported it the first day, but they never fixed it."
Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,THE STAFF WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE MY STAY A HAPPY ONE. WHEN I BOOKED THE WRONG ROOM- I WANTED A REFRIGERATOR IN MY ROOM AS I WOULD BE HAVING MY 4-YEAR OLD GRANDSON STAYING WITH ME-THEY GRACIOUSLY GAVE ME AN UPGRADE WITHOUT AN EXTRA CHARGE. I WILL BE RETURNING TO THIS HOTEL.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,The location cannot be beat as its just a short walk to the park entrance. Everything about the room and hotel was well thought-out and exceeded my expectations.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"I can see why some reviews on here were not so positive. Over all, the location of this hotel is GREAT! Just steps away from the entrance of Zion National Park.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"If you want to get married in or near Zion National Park, there is no other place more perfect than the Cliffrose Lodge and Gardens. The sun setting and hitting the Watchman is breath taking. Your guests will wine, dine, and dance in an amazingly beautiful location. Hear the... Read More Virgin River running by, while the cliffs rise above your party. We held both the ceremony and reception here and it was hands down perfect. We even had deer walk through our reception! I highly recommend it for the atmosphere. The staff is extremely cordial and willing to do whatever they can to make your day special for you. My ONLY tiny complaint is that we asked for the deer poop to be picked up on the grounds and I just barely missed stepping in some in my wedding dress! But it could have been one small patch they missed. Plenty of parking, easy to get to with the shuttle!"

The grounds, in their design and maintenance, are like an arboretum or botanical showcase, as beautiful as the location deserves. The various aspects of this lovely property sunrise striking the tops of the sheer fins... More"
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"We've stayed at a few hotels in Springdale and this was the best by far. The staff was amazing, very flexible and helpful when we needed to extend our stay. The grounds are amazing, they keep a spa open all night long and the beach on the riverfront is a great place to lounge and enjoy the surroundings. The close... More"

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"We stayed for 3 nights right after Christmas and had a lovely time. The setting is gorgeous and the lodge is well-laid out to take advantage of the scenery. The rooms are fairly spacious and have all the necessities, and the balcony with a great view is a very nice touch. But walls are thin like any similar place and... More"
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"Immaculate accommodations with an incredible view from my balcony, overlooking the river and the colorful rock formations just beyond! Updated amenities and decor, and very clean. Breakfast delivered to my room was a real treat. Fire pit down by the river for anyone to use with the purchase of firewood. I didn't want to leave!"
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"Cliffrose proved to be a special place to stay and rejuvenate for the next Zion hike. Highlights were tasteful and extremely comfortable rooms, friendly and knowledgable desk clerks, a river and beach (!), a cute deer roaming around the gardens (!!), and a lovely pool/whirlpool area. Plus location, location, location ... this is one of the closest sites to Zion.... More"
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"The Cliffrose is a hidden gem of a hotel in Springdale. Easily missed by the view from the main road, the facility has numerous rooms between the road and the Virgin River.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,We stayed at Cliffrose after a visit to Zion National Park. The hotel is in a great location just outside the entrance gates to the park.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,Great visit and a very friendly staff! The location is amazing and the rooms very clean and comfortable. Loved the pool area and the fact that we could leave our car there even after checking out. Only suggestion would be to start breakfast before 7 a.m. since the park opens by 6:30 a.m.
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"We found this to be a great place to stay, great location, very friendly/helpful staff, gift store with mini C-Store and it all sits at the base of The Watchmen. The meal options were very good and met our needs."
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,Great welcome from the reception staff. Great room. Great views from the balcony. It's also very conveniently placed to stroll to the National Park centre and the free shuttle buses to Zion Canyon. The breakfast room is very quirky but gets the job done. Lovely gardens to wander through - we saw mule deer a couple of times. Great!
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"We have normally stayed at the lodge in Zion for the past several years. This year it was all booked up for a last minute reservation. I did some research knowing our family wanted clean rooms, be close to the entrance, close to the river, have scenic views, continental breakfast and near other services. We were pleasantly surprised after arriving... More"

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"Most of the National Park area hotels are very tired, but this one is clean and comfortable and offers everything you could need during this type of vacation. The rooms were more spacious than expected for a standard room. Two double beds and still some room for luggage. The beds offered crisp, clean, nice duvets and sheets. The room has... More"
Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"The lodge is located between the main road into Zion and the Virgin River.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"Excellent grounds, beautiful gardens, and lovely pool. Just a short walk to the bus into Zion. The lawn out back goes down to the Virgin River, with the mountains behind.

Cliffrose Lodge Gardens,"We stayed in a Riverside Grandview Suite. While I wouldn't really call it Riverside, it DID have a fantastic view from the balcony. Very large room with ample storage space. Nice soaker tub and mini refrigerator were nice amenities. Major downside was the bed and pillows. One of the most uncomfortable beds we have ever slept in. Mattress was very... More"

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"I have stayed at this hotel at least 7 times over the past 20 years. this is going to be a very mixed review.

Nice green... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Quiet, bedding was comfortable. Well lit parking lot. Nice place."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Check in was bad. Staff was rude like they wasn't expecting a guest late when I called and confirmed earlier that day. Empty water bottle found in room under a chair while just placing my bag down. I found the same kinda water in the fridge. It was an 8 pack with only one full one left in it. I have no idea if it was supplied by the hotel or not. We threw it out. The toilet made a high pitched noise that would only stop it after you flushed it again. The Kleenex tissue had only 1 tissue and was never replaced at all. The morning we left when we stopped by the continental breakfast the same employee that checked me in was there. She acknowledged 1/10 people in the room. I even said good morning to no reply. It was a convenient location for our trip to Becker College for our son. We had a 2 day orientation and would have had a more pleasant stay here if things like this were actually addressed. I know it's hard work and not appreciated by many. But as for someone that works in customer service every day myself I was amazed by the lack of interaction between hotel staff and guests. These things reflect upon upper management. Maybe some team building exercises to make their job not just a job but a fun and good safe place to work as well. If I was to stay here again it would be simply because of location...:)
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,A decent hotel for the pocket conscious..my room was on the first floor near elevator. Heard everyone getting in n out. The bathroom was basic no frills..had to hold the toilet handle in order for it to flush properly. Toilet n shower set apart from bathroom sink...didnt like that. In order to get ice you have to go to the 3rd floor it... Breakfast was nice...they need more than one waffle maker. Staff not very friendly either.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"We had a family visit and decided to try the LaQuinta. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room could have used a little better sound proofing - both highway noise and noise from hall and other rooms were more noticeable than other hotels where I've recently stayed. Room was comfortable and clean, but could have used a little touch up."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This is the 3rd or 4th year my husband I have stayed here. It is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home from our summer home, and they take dogs. But this time the bathroom was filthy, it wasn't and cleaned, we were not comped adequately. It was also very noisy on the front of the... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Lobby was under construction but no noise at night. Room smelled musty and smokey. Breakfast was bread, cereal, yogurt and hard boiled egg. Not worth eating there for breakfast. Staff was not friendly."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Bring your own pillow. The ones here are hard as a rock. Bed is hard too
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This particular hotel is located a few blocks from the interstate and easy to get to. I found the hotel to be clean and quiet, except for highway traffic noise. This is smoke-free hotel, which was great! A very big plus."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,12pm checkout! Shaweet!

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"We stayed at this hotel while we were bringing our youngest to college orientation at Becker college.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,It was a quick overnight stay to see colleges in the area. The hotel was good. I would stay there again because the price was right.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,The room was very nice. Staff was as helpful as they could be. There were a couple of things that I was VERY disappointed by. First was the breakfast. They had no eggs!! I have allergies and could not eat much else. I was looking forward to a hot breakfast in the morning. Also I understand that the rooms need to be cleaned but not while I am sleeping.. I was still asleep and they started to vacuum the room above me.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Basic hotel outside of Worcester, not too far from Boston. Was able to check in early, which is always a plus. Room was near elevator but didnt really have too much noise. There was a smokey smell in room despite it being non-smoking. would stay again in a pinch."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Booked a king room for me and my wife....got to the hotel and they informed us because we booked online, we got the FULL size bed due to not having enough rooms. Incredibly disappointed. The heat blew freezing air for about 10 minutes before warming up, which in the middle of February is less than desirable. Overall, for the price, I probably wouldn't stay here again."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Bad experience. No soap shampoo towels. Smell of smoke. Alerted front desk. Gave us towels etc to take to room. Cold shower and difficult to regulate room temperature.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The La Quinta, Auburn,MA is a great place to stay in the area: it is conveniently located, the rooms are very nice, clean, the complimentary breakfast is great,and the staff is pleasant, friendly, helpful. My only negative things I would say are that there was only one chair in our double bed room, but I'm sure if we had asked. the staff would've gotten us another chair! The biggest issue is the layout of the bathroom. I only saw 2 rooms, so I don't know if they are all like this, but the shower/tub is in a narrow little closet-like room with a toilet. The sink and counter is outside that space in an area next to the door of the room is not screened off in any way from the bedroom section. As a disabled person, I frequently take sponge baths at the bathroom sink. In this situation there was absolutely no privacy to do so, which was inconvenient for me. If all you do at the sink is brush your teeth comb your hair, this won't be an issue for you. But I didn't like the thought of people using the toilet, then using the doorknob with unwashed hands to get out to the area to wash their hands. Besides inconvenient, it seemed unhygienic to me. But that aside, this is a lovely, friendly place to stay in Auburn so wonderful to be able to travel with my dog!"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Needed a hotel room close to Worcester and this worked out just fine. The staff were friendly but the hotel was a little run down. Still the room was clean and comfortable for the price.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,A nothing special hotel. Room was fine for what we needed but I thought we paid more than we should have for what it was. But it was clean and there was a typical breakfast.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Hey, folks -As I mentioned in another review, I stay in Worcester from time to time to visit family.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This is the first time we stayed in La Quinta hotel chain.Based on my experience here, I will not stay in these hotels again. Worst thing about this hotel is the staff- I believe her name starts with letter T----. she is unfriendly, rude and does not know dealing with customers. There are no microwaves or refrigerators in the standard rooms and you won't get one even if you request it. So we ate our own food in the kitchen room( to microwave the food) that night. This lady seemed to be VERY UPSET because she had to clean the trash can once again(as we threw our left overs there). She showed her frustration to us. we felt this very disrespectful as she was frustrated JUST because she has to clean that trash can once again! Front desk staff never smiles at you (neither at check in or check out process). Bathrooms are very congested. Bathroom shower has full of rust. I would NOT recommend standard rooms for families as they are very small (Ok if you are a single).. Bottomline- I will not stay at this hotel again."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,We rolled in at 1am from Maine heading back south. We were so tired and checkin was a breeze. Got to the room and crashes on the soft bed before I even knew what hit me! Room was clean and updated. Pillows were soft and sheets were crisp! I would not hesitate to stay here anytime!
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,In town for the Thanksgiving holiday
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Place was great, Staff was wonderful.. BUT the Doors to the rooms shut very loudly! AND so does the outside doors coming in at the end of the halls where we were put. No big deal unless its 3 am and people are partying/smoking and doors are banging.. They need to get those SLOW DOOR closing hinges.. My wife was really P O'd! Called the front desk, no one answered Guess they were out chasing down the noise-it did stop abruptly after an hour of no sleep..."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Room was clean and the staff were helpful.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,We were very impressed by this LaQuinta. It was very clean and had a very attractive updated decor and was pet-friendly! We always love the Belgian waffles on the breakfast bar. Complimentary breakfast was a bit carb-heavy but was fine overall. Staff were friendly.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"I stayed at La Quinta for 3 nights while I got my daughter settled at school . I came with 2 dogs and they were treated with snacks and lots of attention from the staff. All the staff was extremely helpful and went oit of their way for us. Iriene was extremely helpful when our key wasnt working, and brought... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This motel was clean, but disappointing. Our room was clean and neat, but was missing the refrigerator and microwave that I expected to see. Our friend's room had both, and I remembered reading somewhere that ours should have also. My biggest disappointment was with the breakfast choices. Since I am diabetic I was looking for food items that would have... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This is the perfect hotel for me because it is convenient to the highway, decent, and reasonably priced. The bed was very comfortable and the room was large. It was very clean and had great hot water!"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Hotel was average for what we were being charged. The rooms were clean, however, the furniture is dated. The ice machines on all floors was not working and I was advised a contractor had been called. However, there was no effort to perhaps buy bags of ice to have for guests."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"If you are allergic to cats or dogs, you might want to consider another place to stay. The breakfast is adequate and we didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit in the breakfast area. The rooms are OK, but we could hear doors slamming shut late at night and very early in the morning. LaQuinta used to be... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Stayed for one night with two teenagers while on a trip to Fitchburg for open house at Fitchburg state university next day. Beds were comfortable, room temp was good, bathroom clean, so overall pleased with the room. Breakfast was great especially their waffles."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Horrible staff! Drug activity and rooms smelled of smoke. I would not stay in this hotel. The did not clean room during our 3 day stay.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Customer service is not a priority here. I asked for a bottle of water and they told me you have to pay for it, you are just a regular customer. I was offended. I understand I am not a rewards member but to be dismissed was shocking."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Stayed here recently on a Saturday night. The room was clean enough and decent, but overall a little drab for the price. I was disappointed in the breakfast, limited selection that was mostly picked through by the time we got there."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"My wife and I were needing a room not to far from UMASS Medical Center because of a family emergency. La Quinta was about a 10 minute ride and it was close to restaurants,shopping, and close to the interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was fresh and clean and was very big. They have continental breakfast so you can grab a bite before leaving the hotel in the morning. We would stay there again if the situation warranted it."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Strangest bathtub I have ever encountered. The center bottom of the tub was soft like a rubber door mat while the bottom edges were rigid. One either had to stand with one foot on each bottom edge or both feet down the middle, or risk losing your balance. The water quantity was insufficient and too dispersed. The water quantity from...

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"When I decided to book a night at the La Quinta in Auburn/Worcester, I was initially skeptical about how my room would be, for the money I was paying. But my stay there turned out to be better than I expected. The room was small, but not too small for my needs the bathroom was adequate, even if the shower was a little noisy and the bed was spacious and reasonably comfortable. For a single night's stay, the La Quinta proved worthy of my investment."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The only thing that I would complain about is that the should really cover up the man entrance overhang, you could see all the wiring, etc."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"My husband arrived late I'd called in advance to let them know, at 1am they struggled to check him into the room taking a long long time. He said it was a non-smoking hotel but his room had a terrible smell of stale smoke and it wasn't a conftable night."

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The exterior was uninviting, but we were tired and had to get off the road. I suppose this location was priced lower than other chains, although still seemed a bit high even with a AAA discount which the desk clerk cheerfully applied after check in because I forgot. Our room was basic, but clean the bath was dated, but clean.... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,TV reception was poor as well was the rehab of this room. Very sloppy paintwork. Corners needed vacuuming extra dusty on armoire. Friendly staff and comfortable bed. Simple continental breakfast was good and area was clean to eat in. Great location.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,When we entered the initial room we were assigned all we could smell was either cigarette or cigar smoke in this NON-smoking hotel. We were assigned another room but it did call into question the overall cleanliness of the hotel in general that a room in a non-smoking hotel could stink of smoke.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"convenient, close to highway, decent breakfast, clean. big room and comfy bed"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"We arrived late one night and were very happy with this La Quinta. The front desk staff was nice and quick.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,The air quality was horrible despite no smoking signs posted everywhere the air was quite stale and smelled
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The neighbors, which were kids, not supervised by any adults were very noisy. No hotel staff stepped in to make it better. The breakfast was nothing to write home about, slim pickings. Beds were not comfortable, and only double not queen. Probably won't be back."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,don't get your hopes up for scrambled eggs.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,I have stayed at this hotel for the second time. It is a good area and felt safe. Breakfast each morning and free internet were great perks. I was able to have my Grandson's stay with me since that is why I came to this area to visit.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"It's not bad, not great. Really...it is AVERAGE. I was concerned about what the room would look like after entering the lobby/reception area, which definitely needs a facelift, but the room was....okay. It was clean, except for a quite a bit of dust on the furniture which the sun revealed the next morning, there were adequate towels, pillows and the... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"I figured it would be tough to get a good night's sleep so close to the highway, but it was unbelievably quiet. Whatever they've done to make it soundproof, it worked!"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"We needed a decent place to stay for the night while at a convention. This is close enough to the DCU center to be a good choice, but far enough away to be more affordable. The staff was friendly, especially for our early check out."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"earwigs in the ceiling, baby spiders hovering above beds"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Hotel dirty. Carpet in room was filthy. No fitness center. Used computer to print boarding passes and no toner in printer. Asked for toner and clerk said I don't have any it's been low for a while.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Stayed one night to attend a concert in Worcester. Convenient location right off 290 and Mass Pike. Hotel was clean and well attended to. Staff was very pleasant. A hotel to consider if you are ever in the area.

Stayed in Harrisburg PA the night before arriving in Worcester area. Much nicer LaQuinta, cleaner, brighter. Staff much nicer, front desk person on arrival wasn't very pleasant"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Comfortable, well appointed, clean rooms, free wifi, hot breakfast included, and good rates. Right across the street from Auburn Mall and Outback Steak House is 100 yards from hotel lobby entrance, easy walk across parking lot. I would stay here again without hesitation."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"First time staying at LaQuinta Inn, probably my last. I have stayed at the LaQuinta Suites in the past and they were much nicer. The hotel was located pretty central, the breakfast was lackluster, room was just ok. Housekeeping staff was very good room was clean. The sheets were showing signs of wear and looked dirty."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"I booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it was pet friendly, but was not up to par with others in the chain nor the quality for the price. The front desk was small, the hotel was recently renovated but it dd not appear to be and smelled smokey. The most disappointing part of my stay was when I realized the comforter on my bed was stained and dirty, what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks. I was in a pet friendly room, however I expected it to be clean. Otherwise, the room was ok, could have been cleaner, floor in the tub felt unsteady and ceiling had questionable spots. Also the tv reception faded in and out and on my second night completely cut out and never returned. Breakfast was free but not worth the time it took to get downstairs. The first morning was ok, as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit. Morning 2 was only waffles, cold cereal and toast. No healthy options for those of us uninterested in a processed breakfast. The staff was friendly, location and parking was good, and I liked the fact that they don't charge additional fees for pets. They did accidentally place a 200 hold onto my credit card, which I questioned at the front desk upon checkout and was told it was a mistake by another employee. Overall, I had reservations about this hotel based on other reviews I read before booking but figured I would give it a try since it has undergone a recent reno. I won't stay at this location again."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"We were only there for about 8 hrs. Simply needed a place to sleep that was close to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill. We had minimal interaction with staff other than to check-in which while not overly friendly, wasn't unfriendly either. Room was what we expected - and fine for what we needed. Bed could have been a little more comfortable, and the rooms (which had an adjoining door) are not soundproof - we could hear everything when the guests checked into the adjoining room in the middle of the night. Breakfast is minimal, but again, was as expected. Overall, the hotel was fine for our needs and the price."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Stayed here one night after a late night flight into Manchester. Pleasant staff and stay. Close to several restaurants. Breakfast was OK, but I am not a morning eater, but I did have a banana and juice."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,This was the preferred hotel for a wedding I attended in September with my family. We had made the reservation through a 3rd party website so we pretty unsure what the bed configuration was going to be. The staff was generous to offer us a room with two beds. Rooms were clean and everyone was really helpful and nice.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This hotel was very reasonably priced and is located on the grounds with an Outback Steak House. The rooms were clean, but the bathroom floor could use some scrubbing of the grout. The bed was very comfortable. They do have free breakfast, but I did not have it. The wifi connection at this hotel is above average. Super fast! I... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. But there was a stale smoke order in our room and in the hallways. Carpeting was outdated. It seems that they recently made some upgrades, but still looks like they need to do more."

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Unlike most hotels, no additional charges for pets unless they damage something. Comfortable rooms, free WiFi, and a European style breakfast. Cable TV, but no HBO or other premium channels, but plenty of parking all at the lowest rate around."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Be sure to wear flip-flops in the shower.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,When booking this hotel there were rooms listed as a separated area for a second queen bed with privacy so rather than book two rooms I booked this for my daughter and her fianc and my husband and I.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,I needed a place to stay because I was meeting friends for a late dinner.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Was a cold night and the at the desk put us in a room without working heat and then wouldn't help us change rooms. After too much discussion finally changed rooms at 130am. Could've moved us immediately. But the desk person would not do so. I'd be out of my mind to stay here again.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Marginal at best, this motel charged 250 extra because they found evidence the room had been smoked in.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"For a reasonably priced hotel this one is good, clean and the breakfast is alright. We did not find the staff very friendly but the breakfast service was good. We would stay here again because our family is close by but we may try another chain next time."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The hotel was full the night we stayed - on a Saturday. Stayed on the first floor and heard some little child running back and forth for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep. Fortunately we discovered the television has a few themed screens which play environmental sounds. We chose the full moon over the ocean and finally let the ocean waves lull us to sleep. The hallway definitely smelled of cigarette smoke, but fortunately the room did not. However, they sprayed with scented spray, despite my request otherwise. The breakfast was not anything we wanted - all breads, cereals, waffles. I have a gluten intolerance. So I grabbed an apple and went elsewhere. The coffee ran out early and wasn't that good - bitter. The hot water for tea wasn't quite hot enough to make true tea. The bed was fairly comfortable - very firm and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference. The fan in the bathroom was quite loud. No night lights, but the full moon theme on the television sufficed as a night light."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Tub/ shower felt like the bottom was about to break. Snapping sound and bottom gives way while moving around in the shower. Strange goings on outside after dark, people loitering at entrances on both ends of the building. One night (10:30pm) SUV parked at the rear by the dumpsters with people laying down on the pavement. Would not stay here again if you paid me."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Hotel needs an update. Bathrooms are dated, as are carpets in the halls and rooms. Good for a few hours of sleep and move on."

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Busy Saturday, needed to chill out before the long drive home. LQ the perfect place. Bright side breakfast after a good night's rest shower got us ready for that drive. I90 is a very busy highway and requires drivers to be very alert. Staying at LQ made the difference."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"My first time at this location. I have stayed at La Quinta before and my opinion of the chain continues to be the same.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,When the maid cleaned our room on day two she did not shut our door all the way we had over 2000 in our room at.. As far as we know nothing was taken from an outsider. Not good. We told the lady at the front desk and she basically said whoops sorry oh well.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Not a bad hotel - clean, polite employees, etc. The biggest issue was that they installed sensors on the air conditioning so that they shut off when you leave the room.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"The hotel was good for commuting near the highway, but this Clarion was dirty. It would be such a great spot anytime when going to CT, but they just need to clean. The room wasn't bad inside. The flooring throughout all common areas: stairs,dining room rugs, tile floors, and hallways haven't been kept up. I would estimate at least 2-3 weeks without sweeping. The worst was the pool area. Crazy amounts of hair all over the floors. Not just from one day, but at least 2 months worth. It was so gross. Not sure if an entire family manscaped or what. It would be a really great place, if they cleaned and washed Windows. As soon as we pulled in , I told my wife if the landscaping looks like this, we should go somewhere else. I can't under stand how the grass and neglect of landscaping can't be taken care of. It would take a maintenance person 2 hours a week, but I guess the ownership doesn't care. We will not be coming back."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Nice hotel to stay at while passing through the area. Hotel is dog friendly unlike other hotels in the area with ridiculous pet surcharges. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone with pets. Room was clean and adequate and amenities were as expected.

La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Our room was very old and dingy. There was rust spots on the bottom of the tub and the tile and walls in the bathroom where yellowing and had brown stains. It looked like it had been cleaned, it was just old and stained. It was not a room that should cost over 100/night."
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"Truly a dog-friendly atmosphere. The people were all very pleasant, room was clean and comfortable. I requested 1st floor and got it. Breakfast was good. The only place to walk dogs is a grass area in front of hotel. We saw at least 6 other dog owners the night we stayed. The lawn was impeccably clean thanks to everyone picking... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,"This is a mediocre property that shows its age and smells stale. Free WiFi and next to an Outback Restaurant. Clean but not really nice in particular for its price. Hot water in shower, no robe, decent hair dryer and a good bed. But they have an A plus player at the front desk named Jonathan. I hope management is... More"
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Paper thin walls. Could hear everything in adjoining room. Terrible breakfast.
La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,bring your own pillow. the ones here are hard as a rock. bed is hard too
Sportsmen's Lodge,The hotel was great for the price. It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Old hotel very noisy,hearing people use bathroom and kids running around. The hallways carpet and color is off putting."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I stayed two nights with the Sportmen's Lodge for a weekend trip to Universal Studios. The convenient location was what I enjoyed the most. There were plenty of options for groceries, restaurants, and attractions in the area."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"It was ok. Power was out, but that was city wide. The front desk guy was rude."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Hotel is probably over 50 years old and is in need of additional renovation. Pictures don't represent the true condition of the property. Lobby is very nice but the hallways are dingy. The room is huge and very comfortable. Beds are extremely comfortable. Rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and the dcor is in need of a major change. Pool is very nice and is huge. It can be loud - the hotel must book groups but pool view rooms do not have any road noise. The location is terrific. Down the street are a host of great restaurants, salons and a grocery store. Parking is super convenient and is free. Patio food is very expensive but serving size was enough for two."
Sportsmen's Lodge,This is a fantastic place to stay. We have stayed 2 times and will stay again. Love the rooms and the kids love the pool.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I've stayed here before but never will again. There was an independent film being shot in the hotel during my stay, which the hotel never mentioned. They used the pool area for two days and a room just down the hall from mine. Noise and working all night. Then the night they left, the fire alarm went off at 2AM. No fire, just pranksters and the alarm staying on for thirty minutes. I didn't enjoy my stay at all and the hallway carpet seemed damp and smelled. There are too many other great hotels in this area to go here again."
Sportsmen's Lodge,like http://www.twitpic.com/43uz9o
Sportsmen's Lodge,Years of history. Great pool!!!
Sportsmen's Lodge,"This hotel has a large beautiful pool, which is the reason I booked it. My son is recovering from surgery and some of his therapy is done in a swimming pool. As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't. I guess they want you to order from room service, but that closes at 9:00 pm. Hello Despite the positives of the property, it really didn't meet our needs and I won't choose to stay there again."
Sportsmen's Lodge,our check-in special is flying off the proverbial shelf! check in anytime in october for a free app or dessert with the purchase of an entrée at patio café.
Sportsmen's Lodge,We had to move rooms and even then there was no peace. The first night we were kept awake by the pounding drums from their club until 2am. The second night there was a guest screaming in the hall from 2-3am.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"have you checked out the new-and-improved food and drink at river rock? well, you simply must! need some incentive? how about happy hour 7 days a week."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Smelled Musty, shower floor had what looked like scabs that we rinsed out, wall by toilet was painted over what looked like buckling mold, beds were comfortable, tv was small and no movie rentals, noisy during day and into night, 70's vibe and perfume smell, they were not accommodating. Shuttle service was ridiculous so he told us take a taxi."
Sportsmen's Lodge,Great hotel
Sportsmen's Lodge,"great large pool and bar, open to outside guests for only $10"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"This hotel is really pretty (lots of white/white, pops of orange) The staff are very friendly and despite having a 16 hr power outage the day prior to our arrival, as well as a three hour powder outage during our stay, they did everything in their power to get us checked in and make us comfortable! The food in the small restaurant is delicious as was room service and both reasonably priced. My only complaint would be that we requested a quiet room, but our room was four doors down from the swimming pool entrance. It was very noisy and we were unable to sleep. I would look at this as more of a party hotel and less of a place to rest up for a busy day of sightseeing- just because of the constant hallway noise. Im not sure if there is a quieter place in the hotel since we requested such a room but got assigned to the pool area."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Good stay but disappointed about the pool. Apprently in the summer the hotel sell admission to non guest to use the pool. Due to this myself, my wife and my son couldnt enjoy ammentities we paid for. Rooms are nice and remodeled but you can still see the age of the hotel. First and last time we will be staying there."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Our room was dirty, carpet had so many stains. Toilet took all night to flush. Cafe and restaurant were both closed on a Monday. Place was more like a motel 6. If you have trouble going up stairs to get to your room it's not the place for you. We ordered breakfast and we're told it would be half an hour. One hour later I called asking where breakfast was because the hotel tablet said it had been delivered, the girl on the phone said it hadn't even been started and did we still want it. I said no. 10 minutes later the cafe management came to our room (where there is a do no disturb sign) banging on our door trying to bully us into reordering breakfast because he said they cannot waste food. The food had not been made according to the girl I spoke to. They lied. The place is rundown and they will try and bully you into buying food. You'll probably be better off at a motel 6."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The room was comfortable and very pleasant, overlooking the pool. (The pool was great!) Even tho we were in a very busy city, the surrounding grounds made you feel like you were in a very private and quiet place. I have to say, though, I cannot understand why the hallways were painted pea-soup green. Ugh! And carpeting to match! I guess if you are color blind, then the place is perfect."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The room was noisy ,even though I requested a quiet room. Unfortunately they were unable to move me to a quieter room. I actually changed hotels because of the noise."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The renovations to the hotel are beautiful. The room was very comfortable yet a little dark as far as lighting is concerned. Also, we had NO closet space. There was a very small area, as wide as your carry-on suitcase! No door on the closet area but a curtain which hardly exposed that space so we had to hold the curtain out of the way along with the rod that open and close the curtain while we got our clothes out. The three deep drawers available were helpful but there is plenty of room for a small dresser which would enable the closet to be more efficient."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Went with my son to go to Universal Studios. Location was great. Pool is the BEST! Rooms are adequate, clean, standard size but no fridge. Be sure to ask for one if you want one. The hotel is great for location and pool."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Looks can be deceiving here... the pics, and the decor look great, a nice touch, however there is NO insulation, you can hear everything including our neighbors tv. I would not stay here again. The pool and restaurants looked great, but we arrived a little later and on Monday the restaurant is closed."
Sportsmen's Lodge,This hotel needs major remodeling there trying to update it you can hear when the heater air conditioning or someone taking a shower in your room a big loud noise after it turns off wouldn't recommend this to no one unless this was your last option the only good thing was the rooms were clean. the hotels close to Universal Studios Beverly Hills Shopping Area and restaurants
Sportsmen's Lodge,Nice! Very friendly staff. Well priced. Will come back.
Sportsmen's Lodge,FILTHY RUNDOWN DISGUSTING NASTY MANAGER. WE DID NOT STAY IT WAS SO GROSS WE SAW THE ROOM AND CALLED DESK IMMEDIATLY TO SAY WE WERE LEAVING. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE US 225. AMEX TO THE RESCUE!

Sportsmen's Lodge,"Fabulous salt water pool. Jacuzzi needs repair. Rooms are spacious, sparsely decorated. No fridge. Rooms are noisy."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"check in + buy food = get free food. pretty simple, right! enjoy the historic patio café before reno's start - then come back and enjoy the new/improved version. photo: artist's rendering of new café"
Sportsmen's Lodge,The hallway is a bit outdated but room condition is comfortable.
Sportsmen's Lodge,heater worked on and off. windows had a draft. alarm clock did not work
Sportsmen's Lodge,"hôtel design, personnel très agréable, grande piscine idéal pour nager, beaucoup de végétation. je recommande !"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Hotel has been redone, rooms large but could use anothe chair, , chest of drawers something. Because of the size of room TV far from viewing, should be bigger TV, later afternoon their coffee shop closed ,I found that odd and Inconvenient. Liked neighborhood. Tiny coffeepot and only one packet of coffee so could be more,generous. Pleasant. It minimum everything."
Sportsmen's Lodge,Great retro hotel with style
Sportsmen's Lodge,everything
Sportsmen's Lodge,"It's a good hotel, with one of the best swimming pools you will find in a non-resort hotel, but good be great if they updated the rooms."
Sportsmen's Lodge,The staff from front desk housekeeper room service to shuttle driver were all very kind the whole place was clean
Sportsmen's Lodge,$100 ransom for oversized vehicles. small tv. loud hallways. cool property though.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"These walls are THIN. I only spent a night there, but wow, they've really tried to cover up the old rooms with some flair. They give you a tablet that is only for looking at the hotel's services and there is a fancy mirror in the bathroom, but otherwise the rooms are very sub-par. Way below a typical Holiday Inn. Thank goodness I was on the end, but I still could here whenever anyone would talk in the hallway or shut their door. And the doors slam! Even when you are trying to be gentle. The decor is not great either. Next to the TV, there was just one big wall and a lot of space. It certainly didn't help damper any noise. Maybe hang up some sound-absorbent fabric. The guys at the front desk were good, so I cannot complain about the service. The location is great. The lobby was definitely remodeled to be ULTRA modern. Lot of orange and white. They just need to remodel the rooms and thicken the walls, get new doors, new shower and tubs, new moldings, and then I'd stay there again."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"great vibe and very friendly staff. the outdoor areas, while small, were beautiful and relaxing. the pool bar was a fun place to grab a drink."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Came in for a wedding. Honestly, it was beautiful. One of my favorites I've attended. I would highly recommend. They put up a white tent strung with lights and it was surrounded with lush greenery a fountain. Beautiful. Check it out for an event. Worth the look."
Sportsmen's Lodge,beautiful event facility
Sportsmen's Lodge,chill out with a cocktail at the pool bar and mingle with other guests.
Sportsmen's Lodge,stay over the weekend they have a killer pool party on saturdays.
Sportsmen's Lodge,do not pay to park your car here !! it is just �� way to steel $11 �� day from you!
Sportsmen's Lodge,"check in + buy food = get free food. pretty simple, right! enjoy the historic patio caf�� before reno's start - then come back and enjoy the new/improved version. photo: artist's rendering of new caf��"
Sportsmen's Lodge,bien cool super piscine
Sportsmen's Lodge,Spa not working and pool being painted. They should have told us this and or big discount.
Sportsmen's Lodge,what will you be thankful for this thanksgiving? how about no cooking or cleaning?! join sportsmen's lodge for a thanksgiving day buffet complete with all the trimmings. no intensive labor required...
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I arrived at the hotel well before check in and was informed that I could either wait about 45 minutes for the room I booked or get a room with smaller beds immediately. I chose to wait. I went to the Red Rock Cafe during my wait and ate their delicious brunch and took advantage of their bottomless mimosas. It was not even 20 minutes later that I was informed my room was ready. I booked a king guestroom with a city view and it was clean and spacious. The hotel was very prompt with my requests for more towels and an issue with the air conditioner, which was resolved in about only 10 minutes. Overall, my experience was excellent. The pool was fantastic, the service prompt and the employees are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here in the future!"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"We were literally only there for 5 or 6 hours. I would suggest it for a one- night stay. The room was awkward shaped laid out. No other complaints. Big room, clean."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"This was our 2nd stay here in the past 18 months. We really like the vibe of this place. It has a boutique feel about it, is very laid back, and is also clean and well run. The location is also very good (depending on what you want to see in L.A.) The cafe in the hotel serves excellent breakfasts and lunches, and the food at the River Rock restaurant is awesome. We will definitely stay there again."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I read great reviews and thought the location was good, so why not DO NOT!! This place is scary. They spent all the renovation money on the lobby. The beds are lumpy and soft, the pool view rooms have echoes from the pool and bar area all night long. No elevator in the rooms above the lobby and the dcor is right out of American Horror Story. The carpet looks original and this is an OLD place. No bolts on room doors and the bathrooms are tiny! You can barely turn around when you're at the sink because you'll trip over the toilet. The pool area was supposed to close at 9:00 pm, but we had to call the front desk 3 times to get them to close the pool finally at 11pm."
Sportsmen's Lodge,It was a nice get away for our boys....Easy access to Universal Studios.
Sportsmen's Lodge,I signed a receipt upon leaving. However the charge on my credit card was for 200 dollars more. We are in the process of disputing it. I have tried to call them 3 times and the phone just rings. The last time I called it rang for 11 minutes and then I hung up. Also when checking in they we distracted and gave us no information on the area or hotel. They were busy talking to each other. Last the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom. The place is very noisy. Almost like a big party at night. I do not recommend it for families but singles and college age may love it.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The service was great and everyone was very nice. The pool was clean and they have a cafe in the hotel. Unfortunately, the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep. I'm a heavy sleeper and normally don't have this issue but I could literally hear the ppl next to me , above me and in the halls. Doors would slam, I could hear ppl in their bathrooms and the cleaning ladies were so loud I could hear their full conversations. The whole point of a hotel is to sleep and this isn't the place to do that."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The rooms are old and lack creativity. The carpet is worn, and you feel like you're in a hotel from the 60s that is hiding it's bug. They had a wedding that we didn't know about and the music was loud, the after party was loud. Even for the special price. This was the worst hotel I've ever booked on Hotels.com. The towels at the pool were dirty. Needless to say I couldn't wait to leave. Biggest waste of money."
Sportsmen's Lodge,worst internet buffer ever but loading a page is fine
Sportsmen's Lodge,A historic gem in the heart of a booming neighborhood in LA
Sportsmen's Lodge,bien cool super piscine
Sportsmen's Lodge,My stay was great. Very central to everything! Nice service! Very clean...
Sportsmen's Lodge,"the people are  great and try the breakfast, amazing!"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"old school and nice lodge @ studio city, #losangeles #lax"
Sportsmen's Lodge,very old school studio city. a drink at the poolside bar is fun on a sunny day.
Sportsmen's Lodge,Clean and convenient but the rooms are not quiet. We could here the people next door quite clearly and everyone who waked down the hall. We were there over the weekend and several people were coming and going in the early morning hours so sleeping was difficult. Probably will not stay here again unless rooms not available elsewhere.
Sportsmen's Lodge,We had a nice stay. They said that we could use the tablet in the room to order room service but that never came so we called and they got it to us in a timely matter. Overall great stay.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The rooms were nice and clean and everything worked as it should. Ice machines a long walk from the fifth floor, but that's ok. the rest of the hotel looked a bit tired. staff helpful and pleasant to talk to."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I stayed in the Sportsman's Lodge in 1981 and enjoyed it very much. When my wife and I decided to make this trip to California, starting in LA, I remembered the Sportsman's Lodge. I am very glad I did. It has been renovated and is a very cool hotel."
Sportsmen's Lodge,pops 70th bday bash!
Sportsmen's Lodge,"when i checked in several things happened. tv needed fixing, used shampoo, soap and hair were left in shower, and another couple (guests) were assigned to my room. They came into my room, we called front desk and they were met at another room. i saw there key and it was for my room. i was not apologized to by hotel.i asked for a quiet room. i was given one next to exit, always people coming and going. because i booked through you, nothing could be done for me for inconvenience."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"take a peak into one of our private, poolside cabanas for rent! we'll be pool-partying again saturday & sunday from 1pm to 7pm with some of la's top djs! min $25 food/beverage spend - non-hotel guests"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"it's retro funky , not the ritz . the pool is lovely and clean. overall a little rough around the edges ... but then again so am i. thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night weekend stay ."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"our october check-in offer is live! check in for a complimentary appetizer or dessert with the purchase of an entrée at patio café. just our little way of saying, ""thank you!"""
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Stay away from this over-priced dump. The designers came up with ill-advised renovations by painting over tired walls floors and the pool deck. This place is beat. Teardown and start over. Loud, stupid and inconsiderate staff. Doors slamming at all hours. Good luck trying to sleep in this historic hotel. Don't be fooled. Bar is a joke too. Weirdest place I've stayed in LA."
Sportsmen's Lodge,have been staying at the sportsmen for years couldnt ask for better place to stay while here and the service and people are great if you don't wanna pay 11 a day to park then go stay at the days inn
Sportsmen's Lodge,great place to go and enjoy the warm weather in or around the pool.
Sportsmen's Lodge,join sportsmen's lodge for thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings! hungry for more? http://ow.ly/qnfmt
Sportsmen's Lodge,"I had stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge 30+ years ago, and was surprised to see the online photos of what looked to be a complete makeover - but don't believe it. It is no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories. The air conditioning didn't work, so we had to leave the sliding glass door open all night - first floor on the parking lot, so we slept with one eye open, since the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. We already moved rooms once, and were told that the room we had was the last of it's kind (with 2 queen beds) so we were stuck there. There was dried urine on the floor of the bathroom, and someone else's toothbrushes left on a shelf - I had to trust that they actually changed the sheets, but not sure about that. Finally, one of the guests next door was vomiting on the balcony in the middle of the night - so we finally realized that this is a motel for people who want to party all night - probably good for that, but not much else. Definitely not worth the high price we paid."
Sportsmen's Lodge,dj lady sha rocks this place!
Sportsmen's Lodge,"our october check-in offer is live! check in for a complimentary appetizer or dessert with the purchase of an entr��e at patio caf��. just our little way of saying, ""thank you!"""
Sportsmen's Lodge,The food at the Patio Cafe and Riverrock were especially great!
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Room was decent, not what's pictured on website. Wifi was horrible. Only provided 2 packets of single serve coffee. One regular, one decaf Save your money, better value at most best westerns."
Sportsmen's Lodge,Great Cobb salad!
Sportsmen's Lodge,This location was very close to where we were visiting. We were not at the hotel much - the grounds were beautiful and the room was clean. The service was excellent. The bed was comfortable. Walls were thin and we could hear the TV in the next room one morning. Overall the hotel is terrific and I would definitely recommend!
Sportsmen's Lodge,staying with us soon? don't forget to check-in and let the world know you've arrived! ☼
Sportsmen's Lodge,have a drink and lay by the massive pool
Sportsmen's Lodge,"My husband and I chose the Sportsmen's Lodge as our wedding venue because of past experiences. We both had attended events in the past (one wedding, one quicenera) and both were breathtakingly beautiful.Working with Melissa Saldibar and Cynthia Rivera as our coordinators was amazing! These ladies are definitely a dynamic duo and truly are a great representation of the Sportsmen's Lodge. Everyone there was very professional and were always readily available! At times, I felt like I would send so many emails asking questions, but Melissa and Cynthia responded to every one of them so promptly and did not mind. The venue was amazing--my husband and I had the Regency as our reception hall and we married at the North Garden. Even though it was chilly outside, the decorations in the North Garden were so romantic and help set the mood. The reception hall was set-up on time and everything was done to perfection. The staff during the reception were nothing but amazing and always willing to help!Thank you Sportsmen's Lodge and their team for making our wedding truly a dream come true!"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"We booked this hotel last minute and had no idea what to expect. I researched it and saw it had a prominent history in California but was nervous on what modern accommodations it had now. The lobby is beautiful and very clean. I felt as though I was in a really high end hotel. The staff was so friendly and helpful with everything. They had no problem taking their time in making sure I knew where to park, what accommodations they had, and how we could get to UNiversal Studios the easiest. Our room was an absolute delight. You could tell they really take care of each room. Our sheets were clean and the bathroom very modern and clean. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 in cleanliness is because in the shower there was a vent - that possible had a purpose prior to the updated renovations to the hotel - and before we took a shower a big spider crawled out from it. In the morning another spider was found in the shower. The hotel also gave my husband and I a smart tablet in the room at no extra cost to use for the stay that told about restaurants, grocery stores, attractions, and information about the hotel. It was so cool and a great help in finding where we could eat late in the night."
Sportsmen's Lodge,The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pea green color in the hallway is aweful and the carpet is just as bad. I think that this hotel was beautiful back in the day but you can tell that it has been renovated. I should of taken a picture of ceiling over tub in bathroom because although it was painted you could see bubbling under it. Paint was peeling off a spot on tile in shower surround. I asked for a refrigerator for our room since in small print I saw you could ask for one for twenty dollars a stay. They dropped off the oldest looking small refrigerator but it did work. Pool area was beautiful and the lobby was too.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Lovely hotel and the staff are fantastic. I called to try for a last minute reservation the morning of my check in. Spoke to by far the nicest man by the name of Howard. He was humorous, helpful and took my phone number down to call and let me know if I could check in early. I did manage to do an earlier check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible. Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The location was great. Check in was fast and friendly. Our first night there a transformer exploped in the area we lost power at 9pm and it was not back on by morning, went 2 days with no electricity. The hotel could of provided candles or lanterns to have some light especially at night. Or refunded some of the room fees. The power outage was not the fault of the hotel but they could of provided something for the inconvenience."
Sportsmen's Lodge,pool on the weekends
Sportsmen's Lodge,"For the price I was severely dissapointed. The hotel is old, the only nice room was the lobby. The resteraunt/cafe was closed. There was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. The pool and hot tub were disgusting. The cable is minimal and no option to rent anything. They charge you per day for parking in their decrepit parking lot. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were horrible. The bathroom was a joke. I have paid the same price for much nicer hotels. The only good thing about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios. Terrible experience, there was even construction going on in a room a few doors down from me. I will not be staying here again."
Sportsmen's Lodge,No refrigerator...a lot of musicians playing music and singing all night and noisy by the pool. Walls peeling..carpet dirty
Sportsmen's Lodge,wow...i hear eddie murphy loves this place :/
Sportsmen's Lodge,Stay was only okay. Only 1 mile to ABC studio so location was great. Room service was quick and delicious. Room was okay not very sound proof. We could hear the room next door TV until 3 am. Also floor had been rented out to a movie crew. It was difficult to get down the hallway to our room. It was extremely loud. There is a Starbucks across the street but no ther shopping. We were going to see a TV taping so location was great. Would not recommend this hotel unless you need this location. Also a 14 dollar a day parking fee
Sportsmen's Lodge,the perfect place to relax and hide from the crowds.  no need to book a room.  only $10.00 per adult and $7.00 per child. huge pool and jacuzzi.  dj on the weekends!!
Sportsmen's Lodge,The staff were very kind and helpful. Free shuttle that takes you to Universal Studios was extremely helpful!
Sportsmen's Lodge,good drinks and a really well priced happy hour!
Sportsmen's Lodge,Service was horrible. Front desk for check in was very rude. Front desk for check out made me wait 30 minutes while they went up to check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me. Deposit was higher than any 5 star quality resort hotel that I have stayed in!! Room rate was way more money than the hotel quality warranted. The entire hotel needs serious renovations. The Pool and Spa were dirty and needed maintenance. I will never stay at this hotel again.
Sportsmen's Lodge,do not pay to park your car here !! it is just à way to steel $11 à day from you!
Sportsmen's Lodge,staying with us soon? don't forget to check-in and let the world know you've arrived! ���
Sportsmen's Lodge,the rooms are ok. beds are extremely comfortable. don't use their towels unless you want white fuzz in your hair! good lodge overall. non smoking rooms.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"book our universal park & play package for overnight accommodations, free universal studios shuttle, free parking, free breakfast and two adult tickets to universal studios! http://ow.ly/qjodh"
Sportsmen's Lodge,ask if the staff gets time off for sick days.
Sportsmen's Lodge,There is no elevator in or near the lobby. My second floor room near the pool was very noisy making rest in the afternoon impossible. Many of the staff had poor command of the English language. The printer in the business center was out of toner for two days.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"ask for a room with pool views, not views of the sad looking trees in the parking lot."
Sportsmen's Lodge,don't forget - you can be one of the first to check out the new and improved sportsmen's lodge at a special renovation rate:http://ow.ly/nxtdn. check it out and let us know what you think!
Sportsmen's Lodge,The hotel smelled like chlorine from the pool and was damp and musty. The free wi-fi was inconsistent. The hotel staff was adequate but the shuttle service to the Universal Studios was convenient.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Love this hotel good size room ,great location and good size balconies has a template to order ur room service and clean towels. And best part great price for what ur getting."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The hotel has clearly been recently remodeled. There are still touches of 70's style, but everything is clean and the things that you want to be new are. The thing to note is that this is a party hotel. There is an event center on the property, and that's why I stayed there, and others had the same idea. There is loud music playing nearly all day, although blissfully not in the late night or early morning. It's a fine place to stay as a home base, but not if you are looking for quiet or romance."
Sportsmen's Lodge,The French toast is killer.
Sportsmen's Lodge,our check-in special is flying off the proverbial shelf! check in anytime in october for a free app or dessert with the purchase of an entr��e at patio caf��.

Sportsmen's Lodge,Loved it. Off the beaten path. Very helpful front desk
Sportsmen's Lodge,"We always enjoy staying at the Sportsman lodge! We enjoy everything about it. Love the Patio cafe, the pool bar is alot of fun as well. Great location for restaurants and shopping! This last time was our 4th stay!!"
Sportsmen's Lodge,plenty of space. awesome service.

Sportsmen's Lodge,there comes a time when laugh lines begin to show & a facelift is on the wish list. have you checked out the new-and-improved sportsmen's lodge? we're rolling out the red carpet: http://ow.ly/qabjl
Sportsmen's Lodge,"We actually enjoyed our stay there. Sure, it is an older hotel, but it is kept with pride. In my business, I travel a lot, and stay at high end hotels, but I love staying in friendly, quaint, and clean hotels. We will be back."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The room was clean, nice and comfy. We really enjoyed our stay. The only thing that i think needs improvement is the shuttle bus service which can include more places other than universal studios and at more frequent times."
Sportsmen's Lodge,Every employee in this hotel was AMAZING. They try really hard to make you happy and have the best experience. I will definitely come back.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"They hold parties downstairs. So if you want any sleep, don't stay here. Music was so loud called front desk to complain but that fell on deaf ears. Hotel is a bit outdated. No refrigerator or microwave in rooms. But the room were clean and the grounds are nice."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"When we arrived to the room our beds were not queen sizes. I been to many hotels and I know what a queen bed size is. These beds were double sizes. We also selected for city view. As you can see in the photo I posted this is not city view. It was a view of trees and the parking lot. We contacted the front desk and spoke to the supervisor Faustino who gave the worse customer service.He said yes I can see how our website can be misleading. He said they can upgrade if we pay for it. REALLY!!! We asked for a roll out bed since the beds were small we wouldn't fit comfortably and he said no they can't because we already have two beds in the room. They brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor. The room had hair all on the bathroom walls, cracks in walls were just painted over, and sheets had stains. When we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk advised us to meet in the front at 3:10pm and the driver will take us. We arrived on time in the front and we waited and waited eventually I went inside to advise them we're still waiting. It was Faustino who was at the front desk and he told me well it's a complimentary shuttle it's not guaranteed. I advised him we spoke to the lady earlier that day who took the information down for our reservation and she gave it to the driver and how can you ensure a customer of this service, we follow the directions given and than tell us it's not guaranteed. This is wasting a customers time. This was the worse stay and serv"
Sportsmen's Lodge,Great location for visiting Universal Studios. Beds and pillow comfortable. Room was clean. Booked a city view but received a back parking lot view.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Fun, well-maintained older hotel. Good pool. Walls in rooms were thin, allowing some noise from neighboring rooms and hallway."
Sportsmen's Lodge,Enjoyed all but they were having musical auditions and all the rooms around us were playing and singing till 10:00 PM at night
Sportsmen's Lodge,The only issue with this hotel is the TV are hung on the wall no sound proofing in wall you hear the rooms TV in your room. had to call front desk 3X to get the volume turned down in the room adjacent to mine. BRING EAR PLUGS
Sportsmen's Lodge,Always love staying here when I come to Southern California.
Sportsmen's Lodge,The staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into was not that clean. The sheets were dirty the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was dirty. The place is very old. The next morning to take a shower the shower head broke off. The maintence was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but inconvenient. They did put me in a room that was right next to the elevator which was very loud. But theh were nice to move me.
Sportsmen's Lodge,"great place, good value, HUGE portion ��� http://www.twitpic.com/43un6f"
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The rooms aren't bad, but the hallways get loud in the morning. No closers on the doors, so you hear doors slam in the hall."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"Staff was friendly, loved the cocktails at the pool. Very relaxing trip after a day at Universal Studios."
Sportsmen's Lodge,"The hotel was great, but it was not ADA complaint. Needs to stop selling room as City View it was a parking lot and a desolate looking buildings. There were stair everywhere so how do wheelchairs maneuver Picking up your suitcase instead of being able to roll it s not cool, but the employees are the bomb.com! They seem to be able to anticipate your struggle and assist. The guests were very friendly, the crowd the pool came to party and they did -awesome! . Lastly, but most importantly, THE FOOD! Both restaurants were EXCELLENT. We got there Happy Hour - so we could not ask for a better time the bar. The water pressure and shower was great!"

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We chose this place because of location. The room was nice. The staff was very nice. The restaurant and the food was very good. Decor was a little out-dated but clean. The pool area was nice. The pool temperature was warm which was nice. The kids enjoyed the game room. Overall, a pretty nice place to stay."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"This was a great place to stay! Beautiful indoor gazebo, clean pool and hot tub! Great king delux room w access to the courtyard! Would stay there again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Complicado de ubicar no tiene letrero. Muy t��pico hollyday bueno para pasar la noche sin lujos ni amenities . Buen estacionamiento. es lo mejor de la zona

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We had a single king size bedroom.  It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.  The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive.  The hotel has a restaurant inside.  Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.  Other than that we had a good time.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We have stayed in this hotel a couple of times over the years just for a quick couples getaway. There are a lot of great improvements, the restaurant was very good. The only downfall was the bathroom, no working fan and the tub drain wouldn't stay closed...so no relaxing bath for my girl. Overall, the price is right, the food is great and the staff very friendly !"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Could use some updates, sloppy job grouting. Comforters need to be washed."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Good hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there. Benavutos-- great staff &  food was delicious, drink prices were good. Loved our welcoming drink tickets & the free breakfast coupons. We would stay there again."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Check in in was fast, room was clean and comfortable, bathroom could use renovation, breakfast could use healthier options.  E.g., would have liked to have seen plain, non-fat options, a cereal choice with only 4 grams of sugar."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,We originally booked for 2 nights.  We decided we wanted to add a night on but they didn't have our room available for 3 nights.  So we did one night in one room and two in the other.  It didn't bother me. The hotel staff was fantastic. They called me at 10 am on Friday to tell me that my main room was ready and they made sure the room was close so it wasn't too hard to transfer our belongings.  It was clean and a lot of amenities.  The pool was a perfect temperature and the court yard was great.  House keeping did a great job and the free breakfast buffet was a huge bonus.  Overall we enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay here again!

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Despite the pool being out of order, the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. They made arrangements for us to swim at a neighboring/partner hotel so that our plans were not affected. Towels were provided and they were very professional."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,We stayed here for the Oshkosh air show. It was a short drive and very convient. The hotel could use some updating but otherwise it was perfect for what we needed. The holidome area was very nice for my 18 month old to stretch her legs.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,clean and very comfortable
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The room was especially nice the bed was more than comfortable, I slept like a baby and I don't sleep that well at all on the road.The head of the Duffys bar must have had her radar turned up because she did everything just right for a couple of weary travellers, I'll remember this hotel for a long time, every one there had their game face on and the hotel owners should be proud."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Everything you need under one roof. They have a great restaurant, nice indoor pool and a warm comforable lobby to sit and read by the fireplace. A great winter getaway."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Nice, clean, spacious rooms. Nice restaurant and bar area. Friendly people."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"My stay was great. I booked ahead and used their no-cancellation reservation, which resulted in a much cheaper stay. I also liked that they did not increase rates due to the Packer game, as I found many other hotels did. It was a short drive (less than an hour) to Green Bay for my next-day appointment. I really liked the Bath and Body Works toiletry supplies and enjoyed their free made-to-order breakfast in the restaurant located on-site. I would recommend to anyone staying in the area (including Green Bay, Oshkosh and/or Appleton) and I will be staying there again when the time arises."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,This was the nicest older Holiday Inn We have stayed at since I was a young lad. All the amenities and in excellent condition. There was a wedding there and the was great with great food. We would definitely stay again.

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,We had a great time visiting with our extended family by the fireplace in the lobby and also in the pool area. Thanks!
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Nice sized pool with large 3ft depth area for the young ones.  Fun little game room, although the hotel might do well to scale back some of the violent shooting games and substitute a few better suites to the under 10 kids.  Adequate game room with pool table and air hockey, nicely located near the center courtyard.  Italian restaurant food good, staff great."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"If you are looking for a suite at this hotel, there are none. If you are looking for three beds in a room, there are no such rooms. Ignore what Expedia says, they don't exist and you'll be screwed when you get there."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"It was great, everything that I needed."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Great service and location. The free breakfast was very good! Ideal location!
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Food fantastic. Surprised no lift to 2nd floor. Very strange for this type of hotel
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Some one put bubbles in the hot tub. Once turned on the quiqly grew to a foot deep.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"This was a great place to stay! Beautiful indoor gazebo, clean pool and hot tub! Great king delux room w access to the courtyard! Would stay there again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Great staff, great pool. Clean and comfortable. Just wish they had elevators. Me and hubby are getting older and to make several trips up and down the stairs carrying things was difficult. I know it's only 2 story hotel, but it sure felt like more. It would also be nice to have more signs pointing to the lobby and pool area. We were way down at the other end on the second floor and had a hard time finding the lobby.... we asked others we came in contact with and they said the same thing... they were looking for the way to the lobby also. A sign at every turn would be nice."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"During my stay, part of the facility was undergoing renovations which were loudy at times. Hotel should provide discounted rates during renovations."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We had a King room with a sofa sleeper. The room was nice and roomy. The bathroom was very nice. Walk in shower, nice tile. Towels and shampoo all set out very nicely. We had a fridge and a microwave. And we got two free breakfast coupons - which included their breakfast buffet, which was very nice, scrambled eggs, ham, potatoes, fruit, bakery, oatmeal, cereal, etc. They allow pets, which is very important to me! We really enjoyed our stay."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Room smelt bad, bathroom was run down and needed work. I paid 115 and it's not worth half of that."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Not good. Not cleaned. Toys and hair stuff left behind end table. Holes in couch cushions. Stains on counter in bathroom. Water wouldn't drain from shower. Beds not comfortable. Would never stay there again. I have pictures. Way over priced.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Under construction otherwise a great place.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Simple and clean. Nice staff, good food in the restaurant. Close to the highway and a Fleet Farm store."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Great restaurant and bar with a nice relaxing environment located inside the hotel.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"This hotel was just right in every way -- clean, friendly, good places to eat, a comfortable bed. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you, Holiday Inn."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The room was clean and the staff nice and helpful; however I think there was a problem with the thermostat in our room. It was terribly difficult to maintain a decent temperature and I had to sit up for an hour in the middle of the night to decide on a good temp where we wouldn't be too hot (finally settled on 58 deg...it was only then that the heater wouldn't run constantly).Finally, our swim meet we were attending started early (7:00) and we couldn't make use of the (one) coupon for breakfast in their restaurant because they didn't open that early. A rather big inconvenience since most hotels offer a complimentary breakfast for everyone AND are open early for the earliest risers. A hotel for this price should be offering the same. I was not overly impressed."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The hotel was nice, our room was spacious and clean, the restaurant and bar staff were fabulous, but our room had a window that looked onto the indoor courtyard/Holidome. No privacy or ability to open a window for ventilation. This would have been okay if we had been notified and offered a discount."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Excellent in every way. Only thing we didn't like was the smell of cigarette smoke in the halls and around a party that was going on, and maybe someone was smoking or it was drifting in from outside. Had a wonderful stay. Thanks"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Friendly staff, clean and comfortable room."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Everything was fine but the internet and the warmth of the room was lacking.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"I was checked in by a nice gentleman, and my room was nice.  The bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  However, after the visitation for my grandmother's funeral my cousins, aunts, uncle and I met up in the restaurant, and that's where the nightmare occurred.1.  I ordered gluten free because I have celiac, and the waitress put the order in for regular.  Fortunately, I figured it out before eating it.  When I received my gluten free burger I was completely underwhelmed.  Plus, I ordered it with bacon and didn't receive it.2.  Another order at our table was lost completely so it took over an hour for them to get their food.  When they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make any amends.3.  It took over 1/2 hour for everyone to get their food even though we all ordered separately and at different times.4.  When food came the waitress gave the wrong orders to people.  She was very nice, but I wonder if she was new.5.  After that I saw the manager having a hissy fit at the front desk.  He was aggressively grabbing papers out of other staff's hands, raising his voice and glaring at me as I walked by.  I hadn't even spoken to him!  He made me very nervous.6.  It took well over 1/2 hour to pay with a credit card.  I'm assuming that the credit card machine in the restaurant was broken because I saw our waitress at the front desk running our cards.7.  My aunt ended up being charged twice after she got home and checked her online statement."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the section we were in. Much older part of the building bit one of the lesser expensive hotels in the area.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"it was acceptable, under rennovation though"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Outside made us a little nervous, but inside was extremely nice, and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We all said if we come back to the area we would definately stay there again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn with our two small kids while visiting my grandmother in Fond du Lac. We had a great time. Our kids had tons of fun in the pool and the game areas. It was especially fun to have a place to play considering it rained one day during our stay. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The hotel is a bit dated, but the rooms have been updated and are very clean and comfortable. The free breakfast is a definite upgrade over your standard continental breakfast as it is run through the restaurant. While we were there, we had a full breakfast buffet each morning. For future trips to Fond du Lac, the Holiday Inn is definitely where we'll stay."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Nothing *wrong* with the hotel. Its just an older facility that needs an update. Rather noisy. Its easy to hear people talking at normal levels in the next room or in the hallways. Staff is really friendly, although the housekeeping service didn't do as thorough as a job as you usually get."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,We stayed here for the Oshkosh air show. It was a short drive and very convient. The hotel could use some updating but otherwise it was perfect for what we needed. The holidome area was very nice for my 18 month old to stretch her legs.

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We traveled from CA to Fond du Lac for my father's funeral services. I made this reservation on Hotels.com because we needed a trusted hotel name since we would be traveling with our 1 year old baby. No where was it disclosed that this Holiday Inn was undergoing MAJOR renovations. Neither hotels.com, nor the hotel itself informed us at check in that our room was literally one foot away from a hallway that was in shambles with the entire length of the hallway rug removed, concrete floors covered with debris including nails, shards of hard and soft lastic, and crumbled foam, sealant and other hazards. This was all going on with exit doors ajar and workers coming in and out of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather. Each day we dealt with unsafe conditions, and the resultant noise of construction was irritating, at best. If we had known or been informed of the degree of construction at this hotel, we would have gone elsewhere."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"This hotel is aging a bit but its still nice. Its two floors (no elevator) and its a bit incognito as there really isn't a sign to let you know its a Holiday Inn. The nice new big Holiday Inn Express with the glowing sign is next door, this is not that hotel. Although aging and in need of a room refresh, the lobby and common areas are nice and the front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with a late check out. There is a great Italian Restaurant in the lobby that in 3 meals never disappointed and there is also a large bar. It was weird having a room with a window that looked into the indoor common pool/game area so no natural light and for some unknown reason, someone was vacuuming the carpet in that area at 7am one morning. Not a pleasant wake up call. All in all though it was pretty decent and i would stay again."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Every member of the staff that we encountered was extremely helpful and polite. They went out of their way to serve you and were kind and friendly while doing so. Even my children commented on how nice everybody was. The room was very nice; comfortable beds; and plenty of room.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Lots of great incentives/coupons. Clean. The shower was a little old looking, but I enjoyed everything else."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Ok hotel old for price not what expected but air fair was going on so might have had something to do with price. Staff was nice and free breakfast vouchers a plus.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Everything was great except that there were other guests having their party in the hallway until after midnight.  If they had not closed down the pool at 10 they would have been able to continue their party away from the sleeping rooms.  But the rooms were very nice, comfortable beds and pillows, plush towels, and even a keurig coffee maker in the room.  One other thing, it would have been nice to have a channel on the TV that was designated as a guide to what was on the other channels.  Breakfast was included in the price and was wonderful.  Not your normal juice, bagel, cereal bar.  It was a full breakfast buffet like you would pay for in a restaurant."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Under construction otherwise a great place.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"hotel was very nice and clean, pool area was very nice. We were there for Rock USA and it was very easy to get there and back from the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good and the pool and hot tub were definately a plus."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Love the Holidome with pool and hot tub. Great gathering area with games, ping pong, pool. We have a family gatherings and order pizza.  Great for the kids to run around and the adults to sit around and socialize.  We always get a room that has a rear door to the atrium of the holidome."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Food fantastic. Surprised no lift to 2nd floor. Very strange for this type of hotel
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,This is a nicely kept up hotel in a small town.  Good restaurant and bar area.  Nice breakfast buffet.

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The room was large and had plenty of ""extras"". Microwave, refrigerator, 4 pillows on the bed and plenty of towels. Unfortunately the smell of cigarettes hit you in the face as soon as you opened the door. This was supposed to be a non-smoking room but I wonder when it became ""non-smoking"". I had to wash all the clothes I hung up in the closet. The air conditioner was very loud as well.The buffet was just okay, if you did not have the buffet service was very slow."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"During my stay, part of the facility was undergoing renovations which were loudy at times. Hotel should provide discounted rates during renovations."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Arrived late at night exhausted and ready to sleep. Got to my room, unpacked, put my young son to bed, pulled down my covers, and the sheets were filthy. As in, not washed after the last person slept in them filthy."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Not bad for an older Holiday Inn. Shower was a bit outdated. Food and bar were both good. Easy access off highway and close to hockey rink where my daughter played. I would stay again.

My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us. Breakfast in the morning was different. They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated. Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We had a single king size bedroom. It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom. Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive. The hotel has a restaurant inside. Prices were typical of a fancier place 12 for sandwich with side 15-25 for an entry. I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10 off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day. My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us. Breakfast in the morning was different. They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated. Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat. And this was for a buffet style breakfast. I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach. Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Good hotel to stay at when there's a conference being held there. Benavutos-- great staff food was delicious, drink prices were good. Loved our welcoming drink tickets the free breakfast coupons. We would stay there again."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,We originally booked for 2 nights. We decided we wanted to add a night on but they didn't have our room available for 3 nights. So we did one night in one room and two in the other. It didn't bother me. The hotel staff was fantastic. They called me at 10 am on Friday to tell me that my main room was ready and they made sure the room was close so it wasn't too hard to transfer our belongings. It was clean and a lot of amenities. The pool was a perfect temperature and the court yard was great. House keeping did a great job and the free breakfast buffet was a huge bonus. Overall we enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay here again!
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Nothing *wrong* with the hotel. Its just an older facility that needs an update. Rather noisy. Its easy to hear people talking at normal levels in the next room or in the hallways. Staff is really friendly, although the housekeeping service didn't do as thorough as a job as you usually get."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Friendly, responsive service. Clean, comfortable stay. Breakfast buffet convenient, hot, fresh and tasty. Large pool and jacuzzi. Pool table, arcade, air hockey, shuffleboard. Convenient location right off highway, easy access. Dogs permitted; large grassy area for exercising. Hotel a bit dated but remodel in progress. I'd recommend it to friends."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"This was once the premier hotel in Fond du Lac, however, it is trapped in 1993 and can't get out. This is a shame because the bed was comfortable, the room was clean,  and only a few touch ups (see photos) could make it nice again. Try the Holiday Inn Express next store, news hotel."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Hotel is clean, updated. Stopped at this hotel after a competition, wanted to relax in the apparent large pool. Pictures are misleading. However pool was nice. My disparity is that room info book states pool open 7 am to 12(midnight), got to pool at 10:40 pm, only to be asked to leave immediately. Pool room poster states pool open 8 am to 11pm. Hotel personnel knows of disparity, but that's the way it is. Breakfast was good. Ended up swimming in morning. Minor, but a little annoying."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Nice sized pool with large 3ft depth area for the young ones. Fun little game room, although the hotel might do well to scale back some of the violent shooting games and substitute a few better suites to the under 10 kids. Adequate game room with pool table and air hockey, nicely located near the center courtyard. Italian restaurant food good, staff great."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Great stay, with restaurant and sports bar in the hotel. The staff was friendly, and the room was great - with refrigerator and microwave. They even provided soft and firm pillows!The only downside of this hotel is that there is no elevator. However, they tell you this during check in and ask if you would prefer to be on the first floor."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Old. Needs remodel. Was very warm in room and hallway and was put at the back of hotel.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We have stayed in this hotel a couple of times over the years just for a quick couples getaway. There are a lot of great improvements, the restaurant was very good. The only downfall was the bathroom, no working fan and the tub drain wouldn't stay closed...so no relaxing bath for my girl. Overall, the price is right, the food is great and the staff very friendly !"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The hotel is quite old and currently undergoing major renovation. We were in 133, which was directly affected by construction involving loud drills, pulled up carpet, exposed concrete and falling and broken plaster all over our hallways. Sounds, smells and the general aura was that of a construction zone, not a 4 star hotel. We traveled from CA with our 18 month old baby for my father's funeral. At a time when we needed comfort, peace and quiet, and a little aesthetic amenity, we got loud voices, early morning drilling, entire hallways of cold open concrete with old and large cracks and broken plaster on the floor, among other debris, all in the already uncomfortable arctic tundra cold of the dead of winter in fond du Lac. My husband fell over broken plaster congealed onto the concrete hallway and broken plastic ties strewn up and down the hazardous hallway. Our baby was awoken by drilling after finally falling asleep while being sick, and I got to write my dad's eulogy to the tune of construction and hammering and loud talking right outside my door. Bottom line, if you are going to have major renovation right outside of rooms that you are booking, disclose it and be prepared to offer an accommodation better than one night at half off."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We had three families from our family staying in this hotel. Very nice for the money, but be warned the beds are very hard. We all woke up sore from the beds"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Poor execution on remodel... it's ""new"" but still dated.Green and black stained tub/shower... disgusting."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Very friendly staff, nice bar in the hotel with good food and beers. Nice room very comfortable bed and wifi! Would stay here again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Very friendly staff, nice bar in the hotel with good food and beers. Nice room very comfortable bed and wifi! Would stay here again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We were disappointed in our weekend at this holiday inn. I chose this hotel because it was the most expensive in the Fond du Lac area which I hoped meant it would be the nicest. The room was small and nothing special.The pool and hot tub area were very nice and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much.We were especially disappointed when we paid $25 extra per night for ""free breakfast"" . There were 4 of us in the room. We were only given coupons for 2 breakfasts. THe breakfast buffet was not very good and only cost $7.95 so Im not sure how paying $25 extra per night justified that. It was a total rip off. The 2nd morning we didn't even eat their breafast, instead we went to mcDonalds and had their oatmeal which is great for $2 and their coffee, also good for $1.The only reason I would stay here again is if I had kids that really wanted a big pool and hot tub. Other than that, this hotel is nothing special."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Rooms were very comfortable and clean. Free breakfast buffet or breakfast to order was good; Sunday brunch was very good. However, most games in the game room were out of order and the hotel staff really didn't seem to care. Had room next to pool area (somewhat noisy), next time will request room away from pool."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"loved it , would stay again"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Check in in was fast, room was clean and comfortable, bathroom could use renovation, breakfast could use healthier options. E.g., would have liked to have seen plain, non-fat options, a cereal choice with only 4 grams of sugar."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Hotel staff was great.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Hotel was allright, but the restaurant was terrible. Way overpriced, with bad service. We tried the breakfast buffet that was free, but opted to go across the street to another place. And the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet (that was free) that did nothing but take away plates and bring us a bill. I asked what the bill was for since it was free and they said it was for their tip. Now, I normally tip very well, but we got our own food, our own drinks, and they only thing the server brought Mr was a bill asking for a tip. What"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Stayed over night for Packers game. Great breakfast
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,It was great to get away for a few days. The hotel has friendly staff and the rooms were clean and a very nice size. The bed was comfortable. We slept well.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Friendly and helpful staff. Loved the welcome drink. Great breakfast selection.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We loved the hotel and specially the front desk service we received from David (he is amazing!). We first got an indoor pool view room. We asked for a room with a view outside as I am very senzitive to the chlorine smell coming from the pool. They made the upgrade right away. Make sure you ask for this when you book the room. The only complain I have is that the pool and the recreational area are all in one big room. If I want to play billiard I have to breathe the chlorine. Other than that, all perfect."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Great customer service. Clean room and great restaurant on the property!

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,It was too late to cancel. We didn't find out about the construction being done till we got there. I would expect Expedia to know these things before charging me almost 300 for the two nights! Very disappointed!
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,A/C was not keeping up.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Convenient
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The air conditioning unit in our room needs some maintenance as it was extremely loud and vibrating every time it turned on. This was mostly annoying as I'm a light sleeper and it woke me up every hour during the night. Other than that, everything was great."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Stayed overnight with the kids for a one night getaway. This hotel really brings me back to the old Holidome. There was so much to do. The only drawback was that we stayed on a Saturday night and there was so many events going on that the place was loud and packed, but the kids loved it. Not the place for a relaxing stay, but really great for actvice kids!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We had a great stay at this hotel, following a minor mix up in our room and having to pay more than we expected.  The hotel (and the town) are kind of a throwback to the great Holiday Inns of my youth.  Nice big pool in The Holidome with a fun game room and lots of room to just relax by the pool and watch the kids play.  The hotel bar was nice and prices were good for a hotel bar.  The complimentary breakfast was better than most, too.Overall, a great place to stay in Fond du Lac!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Got over 100 a night wasn't all that impressed with the age of the section we were in. Much older part of the building bit one of the lesser expensive hotels in the area.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Great!  Happy experience.  Why do I have to add anything more?
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Great staff, great pool. Clean and comfortable. Just wish they had elevators. Me and hubby are getting older and to make several trips up and down the stairs carrying things was difficult. I know it's only 2 story hotel, but it sure felt like more. It would also be nice to have more signs pointing to the lobby and pool area.  We were way down at the other end on the second floor and had a hard time finding the lobby.... we asked others we came in contact with and they said the same thing... they were looking for the way to the lobby also.  A sign at every turn would be nice."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Outside made us a little nervous, but inside was extremely nice, and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  We all said if we come back to the area we would definately stay there again!"
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Complicado de ubicar no tiene letrero. Muy típico hollyday bueno para pasar la noche sin lujos ni amenities . Buen estacionamiento. es lo mejor de la zona
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Room smelt bad, bathroom was run down and needed work. I paid $115 and it's not worth half of that."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"For the price it was a great stay. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were very quiet and clean and the staff was nice. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was ok, better than a continental breakfast. Was disappointed at how far we had to walk to get to our room, and there were no elevators - had to use the stairs. The pool was clean and the kids had fun there. The arcade was great too. Would definitely stay here again when in the area."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Arrived late at night exhausted and ready to sleep.  Got to my room, unpacked, put my young son to bed, pulled down my covers, and the sheets were filthy.  As in, not washed after the last person slept in them filthy."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Ok,not great. Property is dated."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Great customer service - right from check-in all the way to check-out. Staff was friendly and helpful. The Holidome and Duffy's Sports Bar were an added bonus. The room was clean and comfy! Beds and pillows were nice and slept like a dream. Location wasn't as close to everything as I'd like, but nothing was out of a 10 minute drive. Pet friendly and accomodating. Will recommend to others and go back when in the area."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"I'm sure this was quite the place back about 1988. Now it is just another dated property that looks like it's on it's way down. The room was perfectly OK though, and the pool area is nice. We also had the restaurant and the large 1980's video game area pretty much all to ourselves. The fact that it is a fairly big hotel that was pretty darn close to empty also gives it an eerily deserted sort of ambiance. Brings to mind Stephen Kings ""The Langeliers.""..."

We received complimentary breakfast coupons and the breakfast was good - had a choice between menu items or the buffet. We were in Fond du lac for a family event so did not spend a lot of time at the hotel. Its location was fine for our purposes."

Breakfast buffet was well stocked, staff in the morning not very the greatest, had to ask several times for water she just kept walking by. Otherwise very nice place."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Stayed here with family members for my brothers wedding. This is an absolutely ideal hotel for a large group of people if you are having an event in the Fond Du Lac area.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Beautiful Hotel, very clean, nice rooms. Love the lobby area and the pool area. We will be returning :-)"

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"Friendly staff and pool area was great for the kids. Shuffle board, ping pong, and game room was great."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Room smelled like sewer and called front desk and they poured bleach down all bathroom drains and said that should work. It worked all right we had to stay in this room and sleep with the overwhelming smell of bleach. We were in room 278 I think overlooking the games. The people out there being extremly loud till about 1:45 in the morning so not a comfortable night for 170.00 dollars.
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,Stayed over night for Packers game. Great breakfast
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"The hotel was clean but in great need of a remodel. There was so much wallpaper, it was shocking. They also claim to be ""smoke free"" but they allow people to smoke right outside the door, with the door open. So being on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room. The room was also very drafty. We stayed in April, I can't imagine what it would have been like in January. All in all it was clean, but we wouldn't stay there again."
Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"I've stayed at many Holiday Inn's, they are very family oriented. This hotel had a good location, the only thing we were not a fan of was the dating of the hotel. Everything - especially hallways were extremely outdated. The staff was friendly - highly priced for the hotel you were getting. However, in that area, there really weren't many hotels to choose from."

Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,"We chose this place because of location. The room was nice. The staff was very nice. The restaurant and the food was very good. Decor was a little out-dated but clean. The pool area was nice. The pool temperature was warm which was nice. The kids enjoyed the game room. Overall, a pretty nice place to stay."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Staffs are very nice!
Bayside Resort Hotel,"I was alone and wanted to be on the more active side of the building but had the feeling I was put in the back, less active side because I had booked thru .com...just a feeling I got..,"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Although the heater in the was adjustable, it was too loud it was challenging to hear the television with that noise. Additionally, the walls are paper thin and I could hear conversations from both sides of the room."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We enjoyed the area near the fire pit to enjoy a drink. Room was comfortable, and it looked like a nice indoor pool even though we didn't get a chance to use it."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We had one of their jacuzzi rooms, the stay was immaculate for our honeymoon. We entered the room and there were rose petals on the bed and a bottle of champagne in the fridge. The indoor pool was great. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. The hotel is within easy distance of anything you could want to do, food, beach, mini golf, bay. It was a great experience!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Had great stay, the staff was great"
Bayside Resort Hotel,we booked this hotel sight unseen and were very happy with our choice. We were on the cape for a wedding and other members of the party told horror stories of hotels they had booked and walked away from because they were so poor. Bayside staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was spotless and the free breakfast had anything you could ask for. The indoor and outdoor pool areas were always clean and well kept. Very family oriented. I would definitely stay here again.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Even though the front of the hotel is on Rte 28, it is quiet and the views from the Adirondack chairs in back of the hotel are beautiful. Excellent stay."
Bayside Resort Hotel,They need to remodel the bathroom....
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Place was clean. Room was comfortable. Housekeeping was hit and miss. Some days they did a great job and others days, not so much. Staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was good. Outdoor pool with the bar is a hit, very relaxing."
Bayside Resort Hotel,It was good overall
Bayside Resort Hotel,It was great for a couple who just wanted a weekend away for a couple of days. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the room was spotless and cool wen when the temp rose outside. It was a beautiful facility.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"i had a great time, got to see the beaches and visited P-town which was great"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Hotel was nice enough. Not as new as we thought from the pictures. Would have been better if there wasn't a hockey team (12-14 yr olds) running wild through the hotel. Staff did their best to keep things under control, especially at the pool, but they were out numbered. The pool towels were x-large and soft. The retractable clothes line in the shower was great since the kids were in and out of the pool several times during our stay. Very family oriented."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great service everyone working was friendly and will stay again
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Nice place, clean spacious. Loved the bath products provided. Only suggestion would be to have another light in the rear parking lot. It was rather dark out there when I had to get something out of the car at night. Otherwise, great place."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Very romantic
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Breakfeast Should have a hot station , like a bacon , scrumbs eggs , home fries , hot oatmeal the only thing I didn't like was the Breakfeast ..."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Good value - much better than chains. Very good location. They forgot to clean the room - but otherwise, no complaints. Has typical free breakfast. No room safe. I would stay again (and hopefully with a room clean!)"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The actual pictures are just as good in person!! Great place! Staff was very helpful with anything we needed! Outdoor pool has a tiki bar where you can order adult drinks food etc! There's also a beach Vollyball net at the outdoor pool! The pool over looks the bay which is where the asesome man made beach is! The beach has a sandy area with Adirondack chairs to relax! The beach is clean, relaxing, and great tunes! You'll find tables there to eat outside too! Close by is the arcade which is great for adults or kids!! If you don't want to leave the resort you can order any type of food from local restaurants that deliver to your room! Great time!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Stayed over for night at cape cod music tent
Bayside Resort Hotel,This place is great for kids. The free breakfast makes staying here with a large family a super huge deal.
Bayside Resort Hotel,They was plenty of places to eat and the food was actually good. The bartender at the outside pool was great ( Avril )she told us different places we might wanna go see and just fun to talk to. The bartender inside was hilarious. 2 pools hottub and steam room were good..
Bayside Resort Hotel,Bad quality of the food in this calorie breakfast.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great little gem! I really enjoyed my night there
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We have been coming to Bayside Resort since my children were toddlers. It is very kid friendly and we always have a great time! My boys enjoy the pool, game room and make your own waffle complimentary breakfast!! We will definitely be back!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Clean room. Great pools. Wish there had been a dvd player in room for movies.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Was traveling alone to meet up with some old friends. Made many new ones at the hotel . The staff was very pleasant, friendly and helpful."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Overall very nice hotel and stay. Location is not perfect, outside the main areas to visit, but still fine. Outside pool fine, sufficient. Whirlpool is a nice plus, but the beach side and campfire very nice. Breakfast had great variety, just not enough seating. Pleasant surprice was the availability of drinks all day."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Family friendly, courteous staff, clean hotel. Two pools, hot tub, arcade room, and nightly bonfires kept us all busy. Very touristy area, so traffic is tough in the summer, but otherwise a great place to stay."
Bayside Resort Hotel,I enjoyed this hotel quite a bit! The only down side is the main desk. I have charges on my account they cannot explain( they're working on it) they are not knowledgable or helpful or friendly.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"My sister, brother-in-law and I were looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the Cape. My sister had just gone through a difficult recovery for her illness, so we wanted R R big time. What we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the halls, overflowing the swimming pools, and then crying or talking loudly with their families-- all of which could be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms. My brother-in-law didn't get to swim once -- there was no room in the pools once all the kids were in. There is one hour from 10 to 11 pm reserved for adults only. Who wants to swim at 10 at night So, if you're looking for a wild, loud adventure with your kids, go for it! If you want RR, run to another hotel."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Stayed for 3 nites breakfast was free and plenty of choices indoor and outside pool clean and opened till 11 nothing negative to say about our stay
Bayside Resort Hotel,The hotel is outdated and has a strange odor
Bayside Resort Hotel,Very clean kid friendly hotel. We stayed a night over school vacation and they had lots of scheduled activities for the kids.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Nice room, pools, bar and a beautiful view. Not a ton to walk to in this particular area, but there are some close restaurants, etc. Friendly staff!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Pool was very overcrowded. There were clumps of hair and candy wrappers just laying by the side of the pool. The lifeguard said she didn't understand English and she actually walked by these clumps of hair several times over a period of 6 hours. Pool area was dirty and had so many adults in the water holding open cans of liquor that we left the pool and didn't return. Won't be coming back here again.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Our stay was great, the staff was wonderful! Could use better quality of tv,needed for when it rained. And more parking,left to have dinner and see some night life, came back around 10pm and there was no parking left anywhere, we had to make our own, don't know if it had to do with bar there, but if so then you need more parking for the staying guest,otherwise it was a great place to stay!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Great value for a family. Needs more protein at breakfast, less sugary carbs."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Super friendly staff. Affordable price. Great looking hotel inside and out. Nice big fridge. Pool was perfect temp inside. Good assortment for breakfast. Would absolutely stay again.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Great hotel! Great pools, breakfast, fridge in the room, firepit..great location to the adventures we did..only complaint was we were on the 1st floor and could hear footsteps all night long from the room above us. Other than that it was perfect!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"First time at bayside resort and I have to admit my husband And I really enjoyed our stay. The pool, hot tub, and sauna were great for relaxing during the day after their delicious complementary breakfast. The area was nice too, plenty of restaurants near by for dinner. Great resort for a relaxing get away! It was quiet, no complaints in hearing our neighbors in the rooms next door. The rooms were clean, beds and pillow comfy. We stayed in a bay view room and it was very lovely!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The room smelled a little like mildew, and the restaurant/bar didn't have a lot of selection or gluten free selections. Pool was great! Views were very nice and the staff was very friendly and courteous."
Bayside Resort Hotel,It was okay. Visited daughter. Coffe maker not working but replaced. Extremely noisey second night. Called room and front desk to complain. Finally quiet at 1:30 am. Breakfast good. Good place to crash
Bayside Resort Hotel,I was only there for one night but I would stay there again
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Employees were great, knowledgeable and assertive. Whatever you need is no problem for them to get for you To make your stay better. We stay there often, and it's one of the better, cleaner and more centralized places to stay. We love it!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Centrally located to most things in Cape Cod. 2 miles to Hyannis which has outstanding restaurants. Perfect size hotel with all necessary amenities. Beautiful indoor pool. Our favorite was the hotel's sandy beach backyard with gorgeous views day or nite! Large gas fire pit surrounded by adirondack chairs great place to return to and hang out at end of long day. Would definitely stay here again.
Bayside Resort Hotel,We were able to relax by the fire and make s'mores while watching the fireworks.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Excellent resort. The premises is clean and well maintained. Housekeeping does a great job each day cleaning the rooms.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Two night mid-cape getaway. Check-in was friendly and quick. Room and Hotel was clean, a nice upgrade from the run down motor inns that line the Cape. Newer outdoor pool was first rate, indoor gameroom was great for the kids. Location is convenient to both Hyannis and area beaches. Poor bathroom ventilation and a tub that would not drain marred an otherwise terrific experience. Will stay here again."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Our stay was very nice. We enjoyed the hotel very much.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Nice hotel.Beds great. Rooms could certainly use an update and need the tv's to be in HD. Bad pictures on the tv. Pools were great. Property is very prettyand nicely maintained. . Breakfast ok. But its free so hard to complain. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Close to beaches and high speed ferry to Nantucket. Room had a jacuzzi tub and came with a bottle of champagne.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Very helpful staff. At check-in they gave us all the information necessary to enjoy the area. It included a coupon for several different restaurants. The sheet they gave us was full of information on many local sites. .
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Excellent pool, hot tub, and sauna. The room was adequate for our needs. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had fun in the arcade and using the pool table. The best part of breakfast was make-your-own waffles. We were there in the off-season, and there were still quite a few guests there. There's a great firepit in the back near the water that would probably be really cool in the summer."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Just slept there. We were out during the day sightseeing.
Bayside Resort Hotel,very popular hotel school vacation weeks.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Only room available was on the top floor, no elevator. Old run down smelled musty. Bad choice would not recommend it ever stay there again."
Bayside Resort Hotel,It was a great stay. This is not for a romantic couples weekend - this is a family friendly hotel with amenities for families. Will definitely be back.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Very nice hotel, clean and organized. Very quick maids which is really convenient! Both pools are awesome, and try the strawberry daiquiris at Bellyfloppers!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Nice place at a good price. Bed was a little firm for my taste but room was clean and quiet.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"central to all Cape Cod. Easy in and out. reasonably comfortable, for the price."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Always have a great time when we stay here. Close to so many different things. Free coffee all day. Pool is great and hot tub.Always very clean
Bayside Resort Hotel,Reservations over three months ago ask for a room in the back with the view check in received a room in front next to the entrance and staircase was very loud could hear visitors coming and going all day and night. When we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Bed and pillows need updating otherwise perfect
Bayside Resort Hotel,"This was the noisiest hotel stay I have ever experienced. The staff was unable to reign in the loud and obnoxious guests who rattled up and down the halls signing until midnight each night. In addition, numerous unaccompanied children played in the halls all hours of the night. We slept poorly both nights even after stacking all the spare pillows and bedding against the door to try to muffle the sound. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody, not even my worst enemy."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Loved the pools and hot tub! Everyone was so nice, happy and helpful!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,The refrigerator in our room didn't work they replaced it the next day we were only there for two days...make sure to double check your fridge if it's not cold when you arrive make sure to call.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We drove for over 6 hours (with a 7 month old) and although we arrived earlier than the check in time, Mike at the front desk was super nice and let us check in early and that was a life saver! The room was very nice except the Fridge did not work. We were so tired from the drive and the fact that we could check in and nap that I didnt complain or try to exchange rooms."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We stayed here for a short summer family vacation. It was in a perfect location, close to Hyannis and Dennis for shopping, eating and fun things to do. The toom was comfortable but it would have been greater with a balcony to escape too and the door to the room needed grease making it hard to sneak out of without waking the entire family.. Breakfast was a nice bonus and I enjoyed relaxing on the outside Adirondack chairs overlooking the water, beautiful!!! The pool and the poolside bar really added to the resort feel. All in all, I would definitely stay there again. We had a great time!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We thought hotel was average. Good complementary breakfast. It's close to Hyannis for nice restaurants and things to do. Indoor pool was full of kids, but we went during April vacation week. We stayed in back on 2nd floor, for the most part it was quiet. Away from main road and pool area."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We had a wonderful stay! Very clean the staff was excellent!
Bayside Resort Hotel,They need to improve their breakfast options.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Nice place, however...We didn't like the ugly brown leaf border, stucco walls, and brown accents- Makes the room look dark, dated, not pretty like the lobby or outside of hotel. It was clean. I saw the bayside rooms- much better with cream tones and no hideous border. You could update the other rooms by simply removing these fall leaf borders and adding light blue beach-like accents.The downstairs was locked at 11:00:just when we wanted to sit and watch the big television and make tea. The breakfast was a nice plus."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We love this Hotel.
Bayside Resort Hotel,We have stayed at Bayside before and truly enjoy it.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"If you have kids you won't go wrong. It's like visiting your favorite relatives that have all the fun things for kids to do. Pools, game room. Rooms are upscale and priced at mid value hotel rates. My wife and I and the kids couldn't have been happier. What a great place. Close to everything."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Went for an overnight belated anniversary, and everything was just wonderful. Facilities are beautiful, including the pool/hot tub/sauna. Breakfast was very good, and nice to sit outside with a view of the tidal area. Also got a fantastic price since it was still just before the high season. Loved it, and hope to go back again for another anniversary!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,The staff was very nice. The outdoor pool was refreshing with the view of the bay. At night there was a fire pit in music. The free breakfast had options for everyone.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Friendly Staff,Beautiful Pool Hot Tub with a Clean Comfortable Room!! Can't ask for much more!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We booked 2 rooms last minute, and based on the (reasonable) price, weren't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were both spotless, and the hotel had very nice amenities, including breakfast, indoor and outdoor pools, pub and a lovely sitting area by the marsh. It is also convenient to all beaches, as well as family friendly activities. I highly recommend, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Needed a few days to decompress. Didn't want to sightsee or travel to a beach just to sit and relax. This hotel had the perfect backyard patio complete with an outdoor pool and patio plus a sandy beach area overlooking a salt marsh at Lewis Bay. We enjoyed just hanging out reading, swimming and having our morning coffee on the beach."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Nice place clean friendly inside outside pool small little sitting area that overlooks the bay
Bayside Resort Hotel,"This was a mother/daughter get away. Room was clean, staff was great and helpful. We arrived early and couldn't check in but we were offered to use the pool if we wished. Great hotel for a nice relaxing quiet get away. The view is great over looking the bay. The fire pit at night is great. We will be going back."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We spent Friday - Monday at the resort. I would highly recommend this place. It is one of the best resorts on the Cape. The pool area is great, the beach is so relaxing with shade trees and/or sun. I particularly liked the caribbeean music with Margaritaville radio playing. Unfortunately, the pool and poolbard close way too early - 6pm. The firepit is great at night. Rooms are good, but the A/C could be a bit stronger. Breakfast was good, but only ate it once. Went oout twice for breakfast instead. Needed a change over waffles and premade muffins. Although, I can definately see it is a great value for families with kids. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. Bartender could be friendlier though. One thing I was not thrilled with is when you order lunch at the pool, it is called down to a local restaurant next door and delivered. salds were VERY soggy fries were cold by the time we got them. As I said, we will definately be back."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Loved the flavor of the hotel. There were many international tourists, families, couples, girls-weekend groups. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. The continental breakfast was the best spread I'd ever seen. They even had make your own waffle stations. I really liked that even though it was located on a busy street (Rte. 28), when you were in the pool, your room or at the fire pit out back, you did not hear the traffic. By ten o'clock it was pretty quiet with only a couple doors being banged close. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our get away."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"very nice hotel, clean and organized. very quick maids which is really convenient! both pools are awesome, and try the strawberry daiquiris at bellyfloppers!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We had a nice trip, hotel was great, just a lot of local traffic made driving around a pain. But we love cape cod and the beaches. The hotel had a great breakfast and the outdoor bonfire was fun."
Bayside Resort Hotel,THe indoor pool was great ! I thought the beach area from pictures on line was larger than it truly was - but overall a nice stay
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Quality of hotel and service seems to have declined over the years. Unfortunately, I think we will be trying out a new place on our next visit."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great but a bit noisy.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The location was perfectly located for what we planned to see. Everyone was so friendly at the hotel and the room was very nice. I loved that there was an extra blanket to put on the bed. It rained at night so there was no fire pit, but we enjoyed sitting outside earlier, we played air hockey and pool in the game room, and the indoor pool was very relaxing. We would definitely come back again."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The hotel, nearby restaurants and sightseeing area were great. The hotel is well maintained with a nice gas fire pit outside on a sandy area by the marsh. We were hoping for a nice, quiet weekend getaway and unfortunately, that did not happen. This particular weekend, the hotel was booked with families with children. LOTS of them. Apparently hockey playoffs were in the area. The rooms are not sound proof and you can hear children running up and down the hallways late at night and EARLY in the morning. Pool was FULL of kids until 10:00pm and Adults Only was for a lousy hour. It would have been nice if the staff extended the adult time for another hour under the circumstances. We would book this hotel again, but next time we will inquirer before doing so. Unfortunately, it just wasn't the relaxing and peaceful weekend that we were hoping for"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Hotel looks beautiful on the outside, but the inside could use some work. The furniture and decor are all outdated. The bathroom was updated but the tub never was so it looks filthy. There was also a good amount of dust on top of the drapes. The beds were hard and not very comfortable. Not horrible overall as far as Cape hotels go, but a little updating would go a long way. The outdoor pool and beach were great. I like that the hotel supplied actual beach towels (very convienent). The toiletries provided by the hotel were great. Parking was also easy and location is central to restaurants and beaches."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We really enjoyed our stay. It was only for one night but I can see us planning to stay there longer. It has a great family environment. We enjoyed the arcade although I found the games a little expensive for a small arcade. The outdoor pool was gorgeous and had plenty of seating. The indoor pool was great for a swim after dinner. The room were very clean and the beds were comfortable. We were only about 10 minutes from a really nice beach. I know there were others but the one we choose was really nice and worth the short drive. We plan on staying again.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Very basic hotel with some extra treasures. The indoor pool and arcade was great on the rainy days. The staff was very accommodating as well without any unnecessary rebuttal. Overall enjoyable stay.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Room clean and comfortable, hotel staff friendly, hotel facilities clean, continental breakfast enough quantity."
Bayside Resort Hotel,All was good - friendly staff - nice clean rooms - folks on the 2nd floor were a little loud - thinking small kids - we were on the 1st floor - funky pub - bring a dollar! Pool was fantastic
Bayside Resort Hotel,Stayed two nights for a girls getaway with my daughter and granddaughters. First time at this hotel and the girls liked it better than where we've stayed the past two years. Will go again next year.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"great location, comfortable stay for families, cozy but nice beach and sitting area outside, clean room. Breakfast was ok and can have coffee/tea/beverage anytime."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We really liked this hotel for the most part. The one major downfall was noise level in the hallways. When people walking by and talking it was like they were in the room with you. There is absolutely no sound barrier and my kids had trouble falling asleep because of it. They were also woken up a couple of times after 10:00. Other than this, the continental breakfast was good and my kids enjoyed the pool. They also have satellite TV - not cable. We were there during a storm - so the television was out most of the time."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Very popular hotel school vacation weeks.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Loved the fire pit and places to eat breakfast outside or inside.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"My husband and I go to the Cape every winter for 2 or 3 nights just to get away. We spend our days at the pool swimming, reading and just relaxing. I booked Bayside because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool bath and I remembered the pool area was very nice. (We usually stay at another hotel but it suddenly closed for the winter.) I booked a deluxe king thinking it would be a decent size but it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice. The room was very run down in need of overhaul. The pool area was very nice but they had only 2 loungers which we were lucky to get during our stay. Construction woke us up the first morning and my husband planned on going to the gym which was closed due to the construction. We ended up having a good time but I doubt we'll return in the winter season. I'm sure it's nice in summer with the outdoor pool on the bay."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The resort was enjoyable and relaxing. The only complaints I really had was the room I stayed in. Some of the sheets on the bed had old stains. There was also small damages on furniture that I have noticed. The room did have a slight musty smell every time I entered the room. Also, I was not a fan of the air-conditioner because it was so loud and you can feel the air blowing on you. I'm the type of person who does not like the feel of air blowing on me. At times, you can hear house keeping talking or your neighbors through the wall. Overall, the resort was cute and nice. The free breakfast every AM was a plus. The indoor poor was smaller than I expected but it was nice. My stay was during the winter so I did not experience the outdoor pool or the fire-pit."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"the rooms are a little bit dark. decent size rooms. the hotel is very clean, the staff was friendly. there were children running up and down the hallways being fairly loud. the breakfast was just ok."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We had an Excellent Stay at Bayside Resort Staff and all the employees go beyond what we expected they are a Credit to Bayside Resort. We Thank You and we will be back. Donna Michael Deverix
Bayside Resort Hotel,"something wrong with this survey I was not allowed to choose anything other than 3 stars. I actually feel it is 2. never asked how stay was. Kids upstairs very loud running back and forth. Game room right below me kids screaming very loud early AM till late pm. Pubic hair found in bathroom shower corners not cleaned. breakfast was very good I would give that a 4. hot tub pool area was very nice but pool was not that warm. I asked for a map of the area and they gave me a map of all of Cape Cod, I wanted the immediate area.when I called on the phone to book they kept telling me to go to the website after I said I had no access to the website.I was able to book cheaper later through Expedia. pillows and bedding was comfortable. maids making loud noise early in AM with drawers and vacuuming. I wouldn't give it a 3 star out of 5 I would give it a 3 star out of 10 which in my opinion is not that good"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Excellent hotel, kid friendly with lots of activities for them during school breaks such as magicians, exotic reptile show, karaoke and breakfast with cartoon characters in costume. The continental breakfast was amazing with a waffle maker and plenty of toppings, cereal, eggs, donuts, muffins, bagles, etc. The archade is nice and not expensive like other hotel arcades (games are all around 50 cents). I've stayed at this hotel many times and they constantly work hard to improve the place. They take all suggestions and recommendations to heart. Of all the hotels I have stayed at on the Cape, this js the best one for its price."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Our stay at the Bayside Resort was nothing short of excellent. From the moment we entered the lobby to register until we left 4 days later we were treated wonderfully. The staff was helpful and courteous and very friendly. They went out of their way to make us feel special. Everything was very clean and the continental breakfast was exceptional! we couldn't have asked for more. This is one of the most relaxing experiences we've had on the Cape. We highly recomend it.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Very nice hotel, lots to do in the area and at the hotel. Will definitely go back."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"First time at this hotel and we were very satisfied with our stay. The breakfast was excellent with many choices. The restaurant coupon was also a nice extra. Anyone with children would be happy with the game room, especially on a rainy day."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We enjoyed the fact that it had an indoor and outdoor pool along with a hot tub. The amenities were very nice including the breakfast. They don't have to include that but it's great that they do.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"I brought my wife and two young children for an Easter weekend getaway. I was not aware that a block of rooms nearby were taken by a group that wanted to get drunk and party all night. We tried to ignore the noise but after midnight, my wife asked the group to keep the noise down. They got louder. After two more tries, we contacted the front desk. The night manager stopped by for about a minute asking the group to quiet down. As soon as he left, the drunken mob was angry at us and star...view moreted slamming into our door. When my wife opened the door to complain, they started to push her around. As soon as I stepped out of the door to help my wife, I was beaten by this drunken mob as my children in the room were terrified. My eye glasses were punched into my face causing me to bleed profusely. I was beaten and kicked as I lay on the hallway floor. My wife also has bruises all over her body. A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved. The management told me that there was nothing that they can do because they have no way of knowing who was at fault. Unbelievable. My face is cut up, my wife is bruised and my children are traumatized. Good place if you want to party all night long. Bad place to bring a family. Bottom line the Bayside Resort Hotel was the worst hotel experience of my life.view less"
Bayside Resort Hotel,The outdoor pool was too small. Great place to stay.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We had a great stay and will definitely be back. Clean, great staff, , yummy breakfast, kids loved the game room and pools. We loved that it was so close to everything. Can't wait to book it for next year. Thanks Bayside."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at Bayside Resort. It's a fun place for kids- two pools, a game room, fire pit."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Rooms were outdated, bay view had small window, bed not too comfortable. Bay was beautiful, nice to sit in the Adirondack chairs and relax. Good breakfast, variety of fruit, nice staff."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The room, public areas and tavern were as expected. The front desk was a pleasure to deal with! Thank you!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"I couldn't of picked a better place to stay it was great, clean rooms, indoor, outdoor pool!! Just a perfect place for a family!! Cant forget the free breakfast and amazing waffles!! Enjoyed every moment of our stay will come back next year!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Beautiful location, nice pool, good breakfast. Rooms need some updating, felt a little dirty."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"clean and comfy hotel, great pool and view! very convenient location for seeing all of cape cod!!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,Decent Hotel compared to most in the immediate area. There needs to be away to silence the doors from the loud bang when closing. A minor issue with the room (237) was that the tub did not drain well.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great hotel. Only thing missing was a full breakfast buffet. Only downfall was that tent only serve continental breakfast in the morning.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The hotel is well maintained, with many amenities. The staff throughout are friendly and helpful. The Wi-Fi signal was very strong and had decent speeds throughout the property. The indoor pool is very large and the hotel has an indoor hot tub as well as a male and female sauna/showers in the indoor area. The outdoor pool has a tiki bar with food and there is a sanded volleyball area adjacent to the outdoor pool. The breakfast is great for those seeking everything short of eggs (though they do offer hard-boiled eggs). The waffles are the star of breakfast (3 machines - get there before 9 to beat the rush). I definitely would stay hear again. Very family friendly too!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,OK.. The staged photos made it seem very upscale..not a place you would walk around at night. Clean and front desk was helpful
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Me my husband and our 5 year old son stayed for 3nights and it was great! This hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool a firepit that is lit at night an outdoor tiki bar by the pool..free continental breakfast! And close to beaches, shops, attractions, restaurants. We went to Water Wizz the largest water park in that area. Embargo and Fresh Ketch for dinner both were amazing! I Highly recommend this Hotel we will definitely be back!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Great hotel for the price, very clean! Recommend!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"quality of hotel and service seems to have declined over the years. unfortunately, i think we will be trying out a new place on our next visit."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Got a great deal on a jacuzzi suite on New Years weekend. Room was very new and clean, the king size bed was extremely comfy, flatscreen tv, great bathroom, and clean soothing jacuzzi tub. Timing was not the best as it was a family oriented weekend so children were running up and down hallways incessantly from 8am till around 11pm but we brought ear plugs thank god. When your neighbor turns their jacuzzi on it sounds like a freight train and they were using their jacuzzi till 1am which was just ridiculous they were probably sleeping in there yet again thank god for good ear plugs and the plush mattress we still managed to sleep great! The continental breakfast was okay, the belgian waffle makers were pretty good and a decent selection of baked goods and cereal. Overall a great value just learn from me and don't go during the New Years weekend."
Bayside Resort Hotel,great hotel. highly recommend it.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Check in wasn't until 3pm, but we tried our luck on a Friday and they gave us our keys at 11am! We thanked them mentioning it was a great start to our weekend anniversary getaway, and were delighted the next day to find a bottle of champagne, chocolates, balloons, and pink hearts scattered on our bed. These are two examples of the high standard of service we experienced - the kind that makes it easy to recommend Bayside enthusiastically. Ours was a 2nd floor room facing the bay, and given the cool evenings we shut down the A/C and left the windows open. There was some 7am noise as workers prepared the patio tables for the breakfast crowd, but it was nothing severe. Had the windows been shut, I doubt we would have heard anything. Also, we found the pillows a touch on the firm side, but these are fairly minor issues. The location is really good, and we made several trips into downtown Hyannis, which is a very short drive away. Also, great beaches in Dennis are only about 20mins away. Well reviewed restaurants, and other attractions like mini golf and beaches are very close, if not walking distance. We would happily stay here again!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Really nice spot on the salt marshes for family vacations, and the close proximity to area attractions and activities. Friendly, helpful staff will make you feel at ease."
Bayside Resort Hotel,We had a great time!! My only complaint is that the beds were hard.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"I brought my wife and two young children for an Easter weekend getaway.

Bottom line the Bayside Resort Hotel was the worst hotel experience of my life."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great hotel. Highly recommend it.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"My wife and I were given room no 135 on first floor (with king bed). The room was old and not fresh - there was a mild odor and carpet was very old too. The ironing board had a burnt top and we started developing itching at night. We called the front desk and got the sheets changed and I immediately posted a bad review. Next day, our room was changed to room 200 in the second floor which was much better, newer and cleaner. Could not complain about that room. Second floor must be newly constructed and so better. Plus they have the decks. For the hotel's prompt action, I am giving a 3 star rating."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"When we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in. The receptionist replied we will see what we can do, you might be able to check in at 3 she told us we could have a drink at the outdoor bar and the bar tender would let us know when our room was ready. At the outdoor bar the bartender was very friendly . We sat outside with our new born baby had one drink and proceeded to watch several other groups check in. At around 3:15 the bartender called the front desk to ask about our room which was finally ready...In the four hours we saw at least 7 other people pull in and check in then go in there rooms. It was just odd ours took so long and we were last to check in for the day when we were there at 11. Other than that the location was Good the people were friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was hard."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Good location to explore cape cod and the islands from. Family friendly, but a bit child noise at night. Nice pool and gathering area near beautiful marsh."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Although the hotel was full, pools and dining area small, it never felt crowded rooms and hotel in general is very soundproof great sitting area by the salt water marsh and great view. The hotel is about 1.4 mile walk to Hyannis shopping,resturants and harbor."
Bayside Resort Hotel,bad quality of the food in this calorie breakfast.
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Clean and comfy hotel, great pool and view! Very convenient location for seeing all of cape cod!!!"
Bayside Resort Hotel,"The hotel room was very nice. While the hotel has a historic feel to it, the room is updated and very comfortable. My travel partner did not like the continental breakfast and said that the restaurant smelled. Otherwise it was a great hotel at a great price. The picture shown is of the mansion and not of the hotel."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"This hotel was in a good location, close to everything. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. Breakfast wasn't bad, although I would have preferred a fresh egg station instead of just boiled eggs. My kids loved the indoor pool and hot tub. It was very relaxing ."
Bayside Resort Hotel,this place is great for kids. the free breakfast makes staying here with a large family a super huge deal.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Great pool!!
Bayside Resort Hotel,great pool!!
Bayside Resort Hotel,"It was a nice quiet location with a nice view in the backyard, very picturesque. I was also just a short distance to Hyannis and other locations on the Cape."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Bayside Resort Hotel was a clean, family oriented hotel. The indoor and outdoor pool was maintained very well. The staff was helpful and eager to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The kids enjoyed the arcade and fire pit as well."
Bayside Resort Hotel,"Great hotel, enjoyed the sitting area in the back. Breakfast was really good, fresh fruit, waffles, yogurt, cereal, hot coffee, juices, etc. Clean room, awesome location, staff seemed helpful. Only complaint was bed was firm and i like a softer mattress. Would definitely stay here again."
Bayside Resort Hotel,Have been there twice this year both times were fabulous. Great customer service. Very helpful staff. Very clean all around . Pool was great and the grounds are beautifully kept. would go back.
Bayside Resort Hotel,Best hotel we have had in 2 years. Everything was perfect and everyone was so nice. They even had an available room when we decided to stay an extra night. Thank you to all who made it perfect.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Staff was extremely nice. Close enough to many main attractions without being in the center of craziness. Freeway minutes away to get u anywhere u want to go.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Was a bit disappointed that within our 3 night stay our soap and shampoo were never once replaced. The shopping center at the foot of the hotel hill is a bit dilapidated but once past it the walk to the beach was pleasant.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I arrived alone on a very rainy, dark night. This hotel is hard to find as you have to go up a long hill to find the hotel. I called the hotel to get directions and the guy on duty told me he was busy checking people in and put me on hold for over 15 minutes and I finally hung up. My husband came to where I was and I followed him to the hotel. I thought this was very bad service."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The hotel staff was very professional and friendly. How to get to the hotel was a little confusing but we eventually found it, you just have to go through the Staples parking lot to get to it. The beds are not plush but the room cleanliness and friendly and knowledgeable hotel staff were more than sufficient and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. They had midnight pancakes starting at 9pm which was a treat. They also had a nice selection of breakfast items."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,It was the best last minute reservations I ever made!
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Very nice, and well kept... I stayed here after a fishing trip and was extremely satisfied with everything..."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Good hotel staff was always helpful and polite. Morning breakfast I thought was better than most and even though the hotel is located right off interstate 5 at no time could I hear the traffic our room was second floor at about the middle of the building. I would definitely stay here again room rate was responsible and it's about a 45 minute from San Diego.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The breakfast was terrible, the eggs looked like they were cooked the night before and set out for sometime. Breakfast opens too late....everyday work start time was 7am....had to rush or go without. Yogart cart had old expired yogart."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Restful evenings. Very Quiet, even though very near Interstate-5. Convenient parking with wide spaces. Almost immediate access to I-5. Easy to travel north or south on I-5 from hotel. Excellent breakfast offerings until 9:30 a.m. (late sleepers be advised). All staff seemed to be happy. Very friendly and inviting environment."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We just had our wedding on July 9th 2016 and used Holiday inn Express as our hotel block for many of our wedding guest. We had a 166 person wedding at the Bella Colina Golf course. Great location too! It was one of the best decisions for the wedding we made! We stay 3 nights (wedding Party too) and most... More
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I have stayed here several times and it's my usual place to go in San Jose. The front desk guy rushed out to greet me, they are always nice that way, and insisted on taking me to see the room when I expressed doubt about the freeway-facing room. They are adding lanes to I-5 and building a new onramp on the gigantic slope which faces the hotel. You can hear the beeping of the machines all day but somewhat muffled if you have the fan ON (not auto). So I guess I can't complain although it is such a horrible noise and you don't want to open the door to the tiny balcony. Breakfast is fine, staff are all pleasant, it just seems expensive at 145 when it's never full that I've ever seen. Beds are fine, even pillows not bad."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,I really liked how quiet this hotel was considering it was right off the highway. It's a little hard to find but follow the signs. It's separated from the interstate with landscaping and sets up against a neighborhood. Comfortable rooms and beds. Small pool. Nice breakfast.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,I have stayed here for the July 4th weekend for over a dozen years. The price has skyrocketed in that time. Irritating to see the price quadruple between the 2nd and the 3rd for a little gouging when we are regulars with multiple rooms. I used to book 4 or 5 rooms now I am down to 2 for a total of 3 nights. This 3 star hotel is not worth 4 star prices.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Proximity to beach or pier is too far to walk really and its next door to the freeway so expect a bit of noise, however grounds are lovely with a terrific breakfast included."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Had a pet and felt like I was put in the basemen having breakfast available and coffe/tea all day was great.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The hotel was lovely, really pretty, the beds super comfy and the staff was very friendly. Breakfast was good but very chaotic with limited seating, be patient the staff are restocking as fast as they can. I would definetly stay again and highly recommend it to family and friends."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"No wifi are we in the 1980s They were unable to get it fixed. They did not care and manager lied right to my face and never followed up, made the poor girls at the front desk take all the questions"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Cool nice small hotel, good service"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Spent one week there in order to visit with old friends, play golf and enjoy the wonderful weather."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Really a great place to stay. The Staff is awesome.  Very professional and respectful. Extremely close to the Marine Base. I definitely recommend this Holiday Inn Express.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The room, service and breakfast were very good. The only downside is the location. It's near the highway and far from the beaches and downtown. I guess it's a really good option for travelers passing by, who need to spend a night in San Clemente"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Within minutes of getting into our room we found animal feces under the chair. Obviously had been there for a while, which is disgusting considering how many people check in and out of hotel rooms and that they are cleaned daily."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Very Nice Hotel
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"We stayed here for a week to explore events in neighboring cities of San Clemente, Carlsbad, Dana Point, Del Mar and Laguna Beach. Quick access to freeway and comfortable rooms. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. The breakfast was expansive and very good. Convenient to the Coaster train to go to San Diego."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We spent a full hour trying to find this hotel. Apple Maps was no help. It is I up an obscure dark driveway behind a strip mall. Once we got there it was nice.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Very comfortable accommodations. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Although the location was relatively close to I-5 there was no noticeable traffic noise.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We enjoyed the friendly people on the staff of the hotel. The service was good and the breakfast in the morning was very good. The room is a good size and comfortable. Good amenities.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"My four night stay at this hotel was unremarkable. The location is poor. SIRI cannot find it, but you can if you drive around the neighborhood long enough. The beds were comfortable but the room temperature couldn't be controlled despite the presence of a thermostat. I was uncomfortable during my whole stay. Average is the word that comes to mind. This hotel doesn't quite deliver the value reflected in the price they charge. It will do in a pinch, but nothing to write home about."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Very difficult to find. Gps sends you to a neighborhood that does not lead you to the hotel.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,All was well but don't stay on bottom floor too much noise from above floors. You could here everything. woke us both up from a dead sleep.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We stayed here two nights while my son was out processing at Camp Pendleton. The staff were wonderful. The breakfast was delicious. Rooms were clean and roomy with the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on! My daughter loved the heated outdoor pool! I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. You can't beat it!... More
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Started in a room that initially we liked. As my wife was prep for bed the smell of tobacco started to bother her coming from the desk. She called about the situ and was told that we could move to a handicapped room. Did not want that. Decided to tough it out and when the cooler kicked in an even stronger smell of cig smoke whiffed acros the room. So after talking to Jessie she arranged a room change the next day. We appreciate the room comp for our last night. Thank you.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Slightly expensive given the quality/location. Shower was non-functional. Hotel staff was nice/helpful.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Good convenient location. Very nice hotel.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Has become our 'go to hotel' when we are in San Clemente to see family friends. Great staff and very enjoyable environment.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The Room was nice but what i didnt like was that when we walked in to the room it smelled like a burnt vacuum. i expect when i walk in. that it smells nice or fresh.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"We have stayed here at least three times now. Always a big, clean room. Not real crowded, but everyone's probably out enjoying the sunshine. Good breakfast with hot and cold choices. Pool is fine, but no spa. That's the only negative. Nice patio area to shoot the breeze outside."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The location was very hard to get too. Physical address did not work with GPS.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Nice Location. Friendly Staff. Clean room. Great property. Everything you want when staying away from home.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Great job on recent renovation; modern, clean, pleasant & accommodating staff; only downside was finding it!"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The hotel was very clean and beautiful. Room was large, clean, comfortable and very pleasant and relaxing. Bathroom was clean, beautiful fresh towels and toiletries. Breakfast was very good with many choices. Dining room clean and comfortable."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The rooms were clean and the beds so comfortable.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"This was a clean, quiet and comfortable stay after a day on the road."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I'd like to give this hotel more stars, but it just did not live up to expectations. Upon check-in, the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's. They blamed it on hotels.com. Then they sent us up to a room with someone already in it- we could hear the tv from the hallway. Went back to the front desk, again blaming it on the hotels.com reservation. They said the reservation number had affected the room number, which is just dumb. Sent down to another room, with 2 queens when the room was booked for a king. Called up to the front desk, they made us come up to get service for yet another room and finally sent us to a king room. Not much to get excited about. The walls were thin and you could hear people through out the night. Breakfast had a wide variety of food, but it was all heat and serve, nothing was cooked fresh. Overall, the hotel was overrated and overpriced. I probably won't be returning to the hotel because they blamed everyone else for their problems."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The staff was very nice. The staff had fresh baked cookies at the desk every night. I thought that was an awesome touch. I have been to many hotels and no other hotel has done that. This hotel was very clean. The only bad thing I would say is the room could use better lighting.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Front desk guy, Mitchell, was extremely friendly and helpful to my husband and I. Will definitely be staying again in the future of needed there."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The hotel lobby and rooms are very clean and beds are big and comfy. Parking is free as is wifi. The hotel was really difficult to find and our GPS couldn't find it either. Make sure you look on a map before coming! Breakfast is pretty decent and also free. Air con is a bit noisy but other than that... More
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We stayed for 2 nights and wanted a place right by the beach... this hotel was only 1.5 miles so that worked out great! The only downer was being on the bottom floor you could hear creaks throughout the day and night of people walking around. It had woken me up one morning being so loud.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Outlet shopping nearby, plenty of restaurants, and a clean, well appointed room. I'll be staying here again."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Stay was great, finding the place was a nightmare!! Drove round and round and no one in the town seemed to be able to give directions!!"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Nothing special about the grounds. The usual cigarette butts and scuff marks on the low wall in the outdoor area. The pool was covered and had nowhere to sit in the sun. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The staff was friendly and well trained. Make sure you have great directions, because even with a gps, it's difficult to... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Very small bathrooms...might be a problem for larger or older people. Also room we were given had an air conditioning unit that was very loud. When we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes they all pretty much were loud. First night staying there the unit was so loud when it came on that we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours. Asked staff to change rooms next morning and they did switch our room without a problem. The staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay, but the breakfast area was crowded with lots of people...So if that bothers you you may want to pass on free breakfast. Also the second room we were given also had problems, still noisy ac unit and also a very noisy bathroom fan. It too was very loud and no I'm not being fussy, it was on its last leg...I think the hotel has some maintenance issues and taking that into consideration it may be a bit too expensive considering.. Also pool was in the worst spot they could have put it...it was right off the lobby making access uncomfortable and not private or a relaxing area at all. The hotel is close to San Clemente Pier/Beach area but not too much around other than that. Again great staff but with the hotel issues we would not stay there again."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Editorial Review by Citysearch Editors Mid-range mission-style hotel with garden exterior close to beaches and shopping. Standard amenities include satellite TV, pool, private balconies."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"We had a good stay here. The room was very nice. The hubby did notice it looked like someone had put something into a decorative vase in the hall. He looked into it, and it seemed someone had spit food or threw something disgusting into it. He showed an employee who assured him someone would clean it up, but the... More"

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"A good hotel. Breakfast has a good selection. Offer free copy of USA Today, which I appreciated. A bit far from the beach, but a whole lot cheaper than a beach front place. Easy to get to the beach from the hotel. Very quiet. Much better than any of the hotels located on El Camino Real. Great staff of friendly people."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Are you visiting San Clemente then stay at Holiday Inn Express right behind the 99 cent store. They have great management and great food. Experience San Clemente in style go Holiday Inn Express.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,No one was ever at the front desk. Bathroom flooded with every shower.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,LOVED CALIFORNIA!
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Had a great stay at this location, the hotel was well maintained and clean. It was very close to the beach which was perfect.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Just a quick overnight while traveling
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Great hotel, with many accommodations, pool, breakfast, comfortable places to sit outside and read."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"A bit difficult to find on iPhone maps and location disappointing upon finding. With the expansion of the 5 freeway, the hotel can't be any closer to the freeway. If you enjoy a hearty walk to the 99 Cent Store, then you will be content. Ask for western upper level room unless you enjoy the shaking and quaking and thunderous... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,The price is ok. Staff is courteous. Check out time is 11:00 The bed is ok. The room is clean. The restroom smelled a little weird. I wasn't sure if the towel were clean or not (did not use them) because I am use to seeing really white towels. The room was a little noisy. I would hear footsteps on the top and in the morning you could hear like construction and traffic. Breakfast is complimentary and picked up a little before 10 although they tell you that it's over at 10. The place lookes nice from and clean from the outside. There is no charge for parking. Free internet.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Quite,beautiful, great parking. Very nice room, and the comp. breakfast was wonderful, hot and cold selections. Differently will stay again..very pleased, No negatives here."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Google maps gives you wrong directions. I knew that ahead of time from reading reviews. Lucky for us we saw the hotel off the fwy and guessed our way there. I would say it's one of the best options for San Clamente, Uber only charged 5 to get us to downtown."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Short overnight on the way travelling up the Pacific coast. Hotel was set back behind shopping plaza next to a major highway. This made it a little difficult to find and noisy from the highway.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Stayed here after my wife and I got married. The staff was great, especially Mitch. Despite being by the freeway, we had almost no noise. I recommend for anyone that is traveling in the area. The breakfast is also really good, Mitch recommended my wife try the pancakes and she absolutely loved them. A+ all around.... Well see you soon... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Nice room. We took a double bed. 5-7 mins drive to San Clemente beach. Good breakfast
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Came to visit family, was here 2 days, 1 night. Our room was clean,appeared to have been recently updated so no complaints with that. Desk clerk allowed us to check in early so we could leave to go visit our family - another point in their favor. However once we got back to the hotel late that night, that is... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,perfect spot...everything close by...at the top of a hill so super safe. Staff and bed were perfect also! I'll be back!
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"The best thing about the hotel is the proximity to all the wonderful things nearby: beaches, good restaurants, and access to museums and good cultural events. We went to the Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach and were able to take surface streets rather than the freeway that we used the rest of the trip. The room was quiet,... More"

The rooms have all the amenities that aren't usually offered at other hotels--FREE wifi, free premium channels/HBO, mini fridge,microwave, flat screen tv, super soft sheets, etc. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and appears much more upscale then many of the other hotels in the area that are priced comparably.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Good hotel, very comfortable rooms and good structure. It is located up on a hill, not within walking distance from anything, so you must have a car. Breakfast is good but not great, with plastic dishes and cutlery. The pool is quite nice. Would reccomend it for people who don't mind having to use a car to go everywhere."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"On a California road trip down the Pacific Coast Highway. Perfect for our overnight stay.

He made a wonderful recommendation for dinner and was... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Fairly nice place to stay, clean and decent and reasonably priced. Which is what I mainly care about. The pool looked cool even though I didn't use it (stayed only 1 night) The breakfast was kinda crowded and squished in a very tiny room. It could have been bigger imo, but it did the job"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"We enjoyed our stay very much over the 4th of July weekend. Great rates for what you receive. The hotel location was convenient being right next to the highway and also being only about 15 minute walk to the beach. We left our car at the hotel our whole stay and walked everywhere. It was easier than finding parking by the beach. Room was clean and beds were very comfortable. Showers were great and always had the right temperature, even after all 4 of us showered. Complimentary breakfast was great and so convenient for my family of 4 and saved us some money eating at the hotel. Hotel property was clean and pretty. There are no views of the beach from our floor level but honestly, we didn't hang at the room expect to sleep and get ready for the days activities so that wasn't a priority to us. Would definitely stay here again."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"This hotel is a good, clean, comfortable, safe place to stay while traveling or visiting the San Clemente area. The check in staff was very personable and accommodating. The room is very clean, Comfortable bed. Coffee in room. Plenty of parking. Hotel and room is nicely decorated and in good condition. Exercise room is clean and well lighted. Good continental breakfast included. Price is reasonable for this quality hotel. The hotel is a little tricky to find since you have to go through shopping mall parking to get to it. It is not near the beach, and is very close to freeway, and there is freeway noise if you open your window."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I had researched this hotel prior to booking and it seemed most people complained about the freeway noise and recommended rooms facing away from the freeway so I made the booking specifically with that request. Upon checking in, the front desk clerk reassured me the room was facing AWAY from the freeway. During the stay, the room was very noisy... More"

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,We were given a larger than expected room with a king bed. It was appointed well including an oversized stuffed chair with ottoman.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Nice hotel for a resonable price. The service was great and the rooms were decent. There was some hair on the floor and in the sink. But over all a good experience. And room service was always happy to deliver more pillows with a smile. Thanks guys
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Good hotel especially for the price. Friendly staff and easy check in.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"This hotel was a little different. Since it is built into a hillside, there are floors below the main floor check-in.

The room was great. The only... More"

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Our family booked 3 rooms to stay in for family members while we organized an estate sale for my late father's home and furnishings. Hotel placed a 50 hold per room for 3 rooms without disclosing the terms or the amount of the hold. They also did not disclose that there would be a difference in the length of the hold depending on whether you used a credit card or a debit card. Since we used a debit card, the hold will be for 5-7 business days. When we called after finding out about the hold, the hotel did nothing to fix this. Unacceptable."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,This Holiday Inn was great in that it is located close to my job which I will be working until end of this year. Do plan on staying here again!

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"My partner and I stayed here for a couple of nights while visiting friends in the area. We were looking for an inexpensive hotel and not too old. The hotel was very clean, modern and very nice for the price we paid. It's got beautiful Hispanic architecture, terracotta tiles, white washed walls and beautiful vibrant Bougainvillea flowers everywhere. The front reception staff were very friendly and efficient and we were ale to check in to our room early, which was great. The room was very nice, clean and spacious. The beds had choices of soft and firm pillows. The room also had a tea/coffee maker, microwave and bar fridge with freezer which all worked very well. The room also had a lovely big balcony, which was nice to sit out on. Wifi was free and there was a small heated outdoor pool (shallow end was 3ft, deep end was 7ft deep). Breakfast was served from 6:30am - 9:30am and had a very large selection of anything you'd want. In the evenings, the front reception filled up the cookie jar with warm chocolate chip cookies straight out of the oven, they were delicious. As in most hotels, you need ear plugs if you want a good nights sleep as you can hear anyone talking as they walk past your room. You can hear voices through the walls from neighouring rooms, but its not too bad."

The major down side was I heard every step and creak of the people up stairs til they finally went to bed around 2:30 am. Free breakfast was nice. Of the 4 or 5 hotels I've stayed at in San Clemente, this is one of the best. That is not a very high bar though."

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,My family and I had a 4 night reservation at the nearby Comfort Suites but had to check out early because it was so bad.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Searched for hotels in the San Clemente or San Juan Capistrano area thru trip advisor. This Holiday inn came up. We decided to stay there. Great hotel. Very clean.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Stayed here recently. It was very clean, comfortable, and pleasant. The staff was warm and welcoming, especially Mitch who was extremely personable and helpful. The breakfast was good and the location is convenient. I will definitely be staying here again."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,I had a great time here. The rooms are nice and the staff is amazing. Mitch at the front desk will give you the best advice on California and San Clemente! The location is only a mile from the beach and is right next to the interstate.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Stayed here for a baseball tourney and it turned out to be a nice place, good breakfast, and particularly great hospitality from the night shift gentleman at the front desk, Steve. Clearly enjoys workin here. We'll definitely be back!"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Our wedding party had a great time during our stay. The hotel was very accommodating to our group and our needs. Mitch and Steve were the absolute best. Could not have asked for better hospitality from those two. Definitely recommending in the future.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"My two boys and I stayed here for 3 nights. We got here by using google maps and had no problem. It is a little tricky but if you watch for the Holiday Inn Express signs, you will find the Hotel. The staff was very courteous from the front desk to the cleaning staff. Speaking of, our rooms were extremely... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Highly recommend. Tricky to find but once you find it so very nice. Updated, hotel feels roomy once you enter and nicely decorated.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"We stayed 5 days as we wanted to spend time at the beach away from the crowd.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Ive stayed here 3-7 nights a year for the past 5 years, and over those years its been a great value around 100 sometimes less. This last time was 140, and I think that's fair but no longer the great value it was. You get a nice clean modern room, with a smallish but marbled bathroom. If I hear the... More"

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I had a work function and my colleges and I stayed at this hotel because it was near by the venue. The hotel staff was awesome, very accommodating. We needed an early check in which Brenna, the excellent front desk concierge, happily obliged. Understanding that we would be drinking at this event I coordinated with her to ensure we had... More"
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Nicely updated hotel. However it can be hard to find with the only entrance inside the parking lot of a shopping center. Two mapping apps took me to the incorrect location. Tucked away on the top of a hill makes it feel removed from the hustle and bustle below.
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Convenient, but not comfy The beds at this hotel are like bricks. Absolutely horrible. So hard that you'll wake with aches and pains. And the pillows! Knotty, squashed. I've stayed here two weekends. The first time I hardly slept. The second time I brought my own pillows and quilts and slept much better. It is convenient, though."
Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,Visited weekend of Sept 19 and 20th for baseball tournament. Hotel well managed and clean. Night desk manager Steve went out of his way to accommodate all 11 of our families. Highly recommend this hotel and will return next time in town. Brett Dudley/San Diego.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"I found the Staff very accommodating, and Hospitable. I arrived on April 13, 2015, and have approximately two more weeks remaining in my current residence.

Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,"Stayed here with our baseball team for a weekend tournament. Hotel was clean and in a convenient location.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Excellent personnel, great amenities and a great breakfast buffet. The pool area was clean and great if traveling with children.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Arrived early evening, last week of August, on Tuesday. We were greeted with a smile and a cookie. When the restaurant we were going to for supper was closed we called the desk and they gave us a restaurant nearby. Excellent suggestion. The room itself was on the 4th floor, very quiet, bed comfortable. Many TV stations available. The air conditioner was efficient and kept us comfortable without a lot of fiddling and adjusting. The one drawback was there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room. Our fault, we should have read the amenities closer. Breakfast was nice, fruit, make your own waffles, variety of dry cereal, hot eggs and sausage. A little something for everyone. A nice side for me was we arrived just before a storm and the warnings were posted at the desk. Having been in a couple of tornadoes throughout my life, I was relieved to know there is a designated safe room on both ends of the hotel for just that occasion. May not seem important, but if you have been in a tornado you know how comforting it can be to know there is a place to be safe just in case. I would recommend this hotel, just remember to bring a cooler for your leftovers."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The Assistant Manager who helped us was very nice. We couldn't get into the room until after 3pm which was fine. When we got to the room felt the room needed a good vacuum and deep cleaning of bathroom. There was hair on the wall in the bathroom, still there when we left. There was quite a bit of mold around tile on floor and under sink. The bed was fine, but wore sox or shoes all the time. Asked for assisted bathroom and room for my electric scooter. Not available."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We usually look for the Comfort Inns and Suites..we were disappointed in this hotel. There was a smoke smell as we entered our room..no frig or microwave. We found Stephanie at the front desk very unfriendly. Sad but..true!!
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We stay in this hotel a few times per year when visiting Galena. It is close to downtown and also a short drive to the casinos in Iowa. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is excellent. They also have a kiddy pool that thrills my son.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The hotel is in a nice setting, right next door to the Ryan mansion and just a 3 minute drive to historic Galena shops and restaurants. Free breakfast was much better than expected, and the woman working the waffle iron went out of her way to make sure everyone was taken care of. Beds were very comfortable. Only complaint- the bathroom was beaten up and tub stained. And the kid's pool looked dirty and disgusting. Never saw any little ones in there, thank goodness."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Hunting trip. Met the need. Service was excellent. Had a very late check in and had no problems. We left the room at 5am for hunting and continental breakfast including 4 different coffee's was ready. I have booked the same hotel for the next weekend.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Galena was our last night on a 7-day driving vacation. The CIS was mostly a good experience. One of the best breakfast buffets on the trip. Comfortable bed. We had a suite and our adult daughter slept pin the pull-out-sofa. There was a privacy door between the areas and separate heating/cooling units. Unfortunately the sofa area unit was noisy and disturbed her sleep. We enjoyed the hot tub in the pool area. Safe neighborhood where I enjoyed a morning walk. Easy drive into Galena.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Great staff and awesome pool.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,The laundry was next door to the room lots of noise annoying. The guide on tv didn't work either. Breakfast was nice room was clean good location if visiting Galena.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Wonderful place to stay. Clean rooms, great breakfast, good location, knowledgeable personnel, very friendly staff and Lori was the best."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Very disappointed in the room. Expected more after reading other reviews. I thought the place was starting to show its age, the bed was not comfy, pillows were small and not very fluffy. No microwave or mini fridge in room. Staff was very friendly though and breakfast was very good."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Nice and new hotel with a decent breakfast. The waterslide was a fun touch. Easy drive from the hotel to town.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Want to thank the entire staff for making us feel like we are at home.... rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly and ready to help.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Easy check in and check out process. Housekeeping was very friendly and thorough. Room was VERY noisy. I could hear all noise from the next room, the room above me, outside and through the hallway. Also, the room fan wouldn't work and the temperature in the room was difficult to regulate."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Two night stay for a getaway with our service dog. A perfect stay.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Very nice hotel. Very clean. The staff were extremely helpful. Would definitely use again.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Very service-oriented. Room was super and well appointed. Nice access to transportation.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"This is the first hotel we have stayed at in a while that does not have a microwave and small fridge in the room. Other than that, the room was clean and the breakfast was Ok. We would have appreciated some yogurt as an alternative for breakfast. Desk staff was very friendly and helpful."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"This is a nice clean hotel. It has upscale features, like a luggage cart. Great urban features in a small town feeling hotel. I wish that there was water (hot or cold) available in the breakfast room later in the day."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The hotel was fantasticclean, roomy, friendly staff. The temp in my room and throughout the hotel in general was rather warm, but it was January and a big storm was expected although it never got there. Overall, I definitely recommend it."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We spent the night here. The hotel has friendly staff and offers a nice breakfast. Swimming pool with water slide for kids. Our room did not have a microwave or refrigerator. Despite appearing to be a full capacity, it was still quiet"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Very private and clean hotel. good breakfast lots of choices
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,pleasant stay
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"When arrived, found room I had booked way in advance was not available. After my expressing GREAT displeasure and unhappiness due to my room I had booked not being held, and that I NEEDED a frig microwave, Desk staff found emergency room:LOVELY! Happy customer! Housekeeper Kim was EXEMPLARY! Outstanding every day! Represents your corporation very well. My husband ran national resort housekeeping business for years! We were impressed with Kim's friendliness, attentiveness and kindness. Thank you, Kim!! Did not use, but pool was terrific! Used exercise room: Nice!Put TV guide in the exercise room. Do not like cable! Get DISH! Nightmare, big waste of time to have to go through channels over and over again to see what's on. Breakfast was very nice.Eggs a little watery (institutional, pseudo-eggs), but the selection was great! Overall, very nice breakfast!Hours of operation of breakfast terrific! Only disappointment:the mattress/pillows. Woke non-rested. Pillows too small and soft, mooshy. Mattress just so-so. Hotel overall pretty, clean, nice amenities,friendly staff. Will definitely stay again, recommend to others. Please tell front desk to let people know about the Chinese Buffet which is close by. Not fancy, but food selection is good, very clean, very nice staff, and price is right! Downtown is a great place to eat, but pricey for 2 meals several days in a row! Thank you for a lovely stay in a lovely hotel!"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Hotel had just had work done on water heaters. Water in pipes had air and iron colored water. We had to open the lines in our room and flush them. Otherwise, hotel was fine."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We've been. A regular in country inn hotels
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We had a wonderful stay while visiting UW Platteville.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"very nice hotel. this is what i usually expect from a country inn suites. the water slide in the pool area was a plus, especially for the kids. comfortable room and breakfast was very good. cookies in the front desk was very nice as well. only negative would have to be the A/C, which was soooo noisy. there were times when it was even difficult to hear the TV because of the noise. couldn't higher the volume so as to be courteous to the other guests who checked in. the noise of the A/C was enough, couldn't add the TV noise also to disturb the peace."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Wedding at Apple Hill was wonderful.., rooms very clean, Brittany was great to chat with. Thank you.. she needs a tip jar.."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Weekend getaway with my sister and nieces, this hotel was perfect for us. Very friendly at check-in. Great breakfast every morning. Very clean, comfortable and felt like home."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,This is the second time we stayed here and both times were excellent. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is very quiet. The pool is great and has a whirlpool also. The room was very clean and it is close to restaurants and shopping.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Hotel had a good location. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Our room faced the back parking lot and there was a light on all night. The drapes in the room do not move. That is my only complaint. Otherwise nice hotel.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"My wife and I just had a quick overnight getaway for our 5th wedding anniversary. At Check-In, I happened to mention conversationally that it was our anniversary. To our surprise, they upgraded our room to a very romantic suite. (It must've been a slow night). The room had everything we could possibly need for our comfort. The view from our window was breathtaking (even saw a hot air balloon). The staff were kind and attentive beyond what we could have hoped for. They treated us like family. Let me add that this is a GREAT place to bring your kids. Instead of a pool, they have an indoor waterpark for all ages. The pictures don't do it justice. They have a hot protein-rich breakfast that is worth paying (over a budget hotel). Play pens and roll-away beds are available when you need them. Great hotel for parents with kids. If I have to be negative, I would say my TV wasn't big enough. First world problems, right And its a not exactly in the heart of downtown. But those things are just being picky. Overall, GREAT stay and would highly recommend it to anyone."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Great service. Nice location.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The stay was excellent. I utilized the gym room and they had dumbbells, and a couple of machines that worked very well. The hotel's breakfast is also very good. There was a wide variety of things to eat. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,The hotel was very nice. Clean. Decent pool. The hot breakfast change each morning. That was a great surprise. The 2 ladies doing the breakfast were great. They were always busy but friendly.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,The room had a strange smell. The furniture was outdated. The staff was very nice and helpful. It made up for the other issues.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Staff was not very friendly. Cleanliness was okay and rooms were tight. We went down to breakfast, and the staff was trying to close up the room 45 minutes before breakfast was to be over due to small crowd. When my daughter went to get a refill on OJ with 20 minutes left to closing, we were told that the orange juice was done for the day. We just kind of shook our heads and chuckled at the curtness of the staff. We like to visit Galena, but we'll look around at other places to stay first."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We just stayed one night for a girlfriends getaway. The room was very comfortable and clean. Very nice pool and not too crowded. The breakfast room is small. Food fine.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Family visit. Prepare for upcoming wedding. I wish hotel had room fridges and better shower water pressure! Toilet seat slide around.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Kelly at reception was great. Every person we met was great and asked about our stay and IF there was anything they could do!! Which was nothing, we were very happy!"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We were expecting a better room for the price. Not quite sure why it was called the Garden Suite. Our view was a roof. The TV was small and the internet was very slow. The positives include a good breakfast with plenty of choices, as well as a swimming pool and fitness center (though the fitness center did not have much). We had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the footsteps of the people on the floor above us. Overall our stay was average."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Great family friendly hotel with awesome pool area with slide, etc. and a game room across the way. Very helpful and friendly staff. Very comfortable and spacious room."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We try to always stay here when visiting the kids/grandkids (2/5). The staff is very accomodating to all out needs. Been staying here over 10 yrs. No better place in town for the money, and we've stayed at them all. But always a little disappointed that there's no frig or microwave in the room. Love the pool and game room, none finer. Learned something new on the last stay. No longer is the best rate available over the counter with discussion. Now it's on-line. The times are a-changing."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We stayed at the Country Inn Suites in Galena during our mid-week get away. The hotel was in a perfect location. It's a five minute drive to downtown.

No real complaints just small stuff..the WiFi is sub par to say the least and some of the literature in the room was dirty and looked like it had pizza sauce on it.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,We were celebrating our 40th anniversary. We could not ask for a better time. The staff was most welcoming and friendly. We had a problem with the fridge in the room and it was taken care of in minutes! The pool and hot tub were great. It was a wonderful get away and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Room was comfortable, whirlpool was nice, fireplace added a nice touch. Staff was very helpful, free breakfast was good. Went there for Octoberfest and hotel was close by. Bed and pillows comfortable."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,My daughter and son in law had an excellent stay!

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Better than I expected. Very clean and the pool was awesome! Great breakfast as well!
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Breakfast was not good to say it nicely!!! Room was comfortable and clean. Staff was friendly and tried to be helpful, but thought they would know more about the area as it is a tourist area. All in all, thought it was overpriced, but guess it is tourist season."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Great place....breakfast is terrific..pool, slide .Hot Tub!!!awesome!!!  We have been coming here for 10 years...:)"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Friendly, clean, and comfortable."

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Wanted something that wasn't downtown or on a golf course. Nice staff and clean room. Off the main road.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,It was very nice. It would be nice if the room would have had more electrical outlets. Breakfast was very good as there was a large variety. The two gals working the breakfast area were really pleasant as well as efficient.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,nice room. awesome pool especially for kids if all ages.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,It was wonderful. Friendly and helpful employees at the hotel. Comfortable beds. Great breakfast.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The hotel room was big, and the bed was comfortable. It was CLEAN, which is very important. The hotel has a fantastic pool (with a water slide!), hot tub, kiddie pool area with a mini water slide, game room, fitness room, etc. Employees are really nice and helpful. The breakfasts were really, really good. We will be staying here again the next time we are in town."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Breakfast is awesome...
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"The Country Inn at Galena is a very nice hotel and met our needs just fine. The rooms are HUGE, the bed was very comfortable, the TV has so many channels, it would be impossible not to find something that suited you. The breakfast was very good, although the seating area is pretty cramped. The hotel staff were very friendly and called to make sure we were settled in a half or so after we arrived. We really only have two comments to consider (for both hotel management and those who might want to stay here). First, we were surprised that our room did not have a refrigerator. It's easily one of the largest hotel rooms we have stayed in, so there's plenty of space. Galena is known for its restaurants, and we, like many guests, had leftovers. Thankfully, the temps were low enough that we were able to store it in the car. For such a nicely equipped and modern place, the lack of a refrigerator was surprising. Second, our A/C-heater unit was noisy. I have gotten so used to those things being noisy that I'm considering writing the Amana company and asking them WHY their hotel units are all universally noisy, even when relatively new. It rattled and there was not amount of pushing, shoving, or kicking that would make it stop. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Galena, though we now know to remember we don't have a place to store leftovers. Overall, it's a wonderful hotel."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"great place....breakfast is terrific..pool, slide .hot tub!!!awesome!!!  we have been coming here for 10 years...:)"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Great and enjoyable stay,hassle free"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Hotel was in a convenient location, no problems what so ever"
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We travel a lot and use Hotels.com ,because it is quick and easy , plus I can see all of the available hotels at once. Usually, we pay cash but, I went ahead and prepaid on my debit card. Once at the hotel. The front desk stated he needed to run it for incidentals. The usual fee for incidentals is 10 to 50 dollars. I was charged the cost of the room again. This is not just this hotel but, becoming an issue with all hotels in Galena. We stayed on Thursday and it took a phone call and eventually by the following Tuesday my money was refunded. Also, our room was against the laundry room. In the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises. Was told we would be given extra points on our hotels .com account for the issue. Nothing has showed up there yet. I have recommended this hotel to our friends and family in the past. We come up to Galena at least every 3 months. Not , sure if we will use this one again. Do not stay in room 224 unless they have fixed there laundry machines."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We stayed here for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay. It is about 2 miles from the downtown area of Galena and in a good area.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"I found this Country Inn Suites to be perfectly suited to the needs of myself and my husband.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Best valued hotel in the are. The staff are lovely and professional. Complimentary breakfast was great! The pool had a slide and hot tub. Not much more you can ask for.. Will be coming back for sure!!
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"This hotel does not allow pets or smoking, which is a good thing for many people. The entire hotel was clean and well kept with friendly, efficient employees. We stayed three nights. Breakfast had a different hot food each morning we were there. The pool area is large. We enjoyed our entire stay."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"We had a great stay at Country Inn Suites. The water slide at the pool was very fun. The water was clean and a perfect temperature. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff is super nice. The breakfast is wonderful especially due to the fact that it has real plates and real silverware. The staff at breakfast was so friendly and so helpful. 3 people keeping everything completely filled and hot. You will not be sorry if you stay at this hotel. It is worth every penny. Also, fresh homemade cookies at the front desk at all times."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"My stay was only for one night, but was exactly how I needed it to be: peaceful, clean, cool (it was summer), easy parking, and easy access to surrounding area. There is a very impressive pool area with giant slide, but I did not use it. Several others seemed to enjoy it though. It is marketed as an indoor water park, and it is certainly to the closest thing to a water park in the area. Galena is cute and small, albeit somewhat lacking for a city slicker like me. However, I really love staying in these areas. Service is friendly and basic, and breakfast is a hot buffet with plenty of coffee. Couldn't ask for more at the price."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"I scheduled what I thought would be fun-a suite with a fireplace Steamboat Suite for the evening celebrating my husband's birthday. When we got there I realized I was getting charge again for what was prepaid. When I brought this to the clerk's attention, there was no discretion. Then to make matters worse I got charged AGAIN. That made 3 times! The new clerk couldn't figure out how to reverse it even while being coached on the phone for a LONG time while we were standing there in the small lobby. He still didn't get that he'd charged me twice. He finally called his manager who came back to work. I got called back with no apologies or comps. Then the manager loudly brought it up again as we were having breakfast. I still don't understand what happened, but over 500 was taken out of my checking account and has not found its way back. I understand taking a credit card number in case there are other charges made during the stay, but this was way beyond that. It took about an hour of our time during our stay, not to mention the lack of discretion. It was very disheartening. The room was a disappointment. Yes, there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it and maybe have a glass of wine-just the bed. One chair was on the other side of the bed. The steamboat theme came from a print on the wall. It was mostly like another hotel room-not a wow factor, but plenty expensive."
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Rating is based on a management decision. Now I understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it. It was expensive enough without an extra room charge. Will go elsewhere next time.

Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,Our room was quite musty when we arrived. Fortunately we were able to open the windows which helped considerably. My bed was too firm and did not smell fresh at all so I didn't sleep comfortably. But complimentary breakfast was outstanding. The staff was very friendly.
Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Galena,"Country Inns And Suites are always great places to stay. This was the first time we ever had to wait to get in our room because of the housekeeping was running behind. I understand these things happen but that was one reason i couldn't give this hotel a higher rating. Breakfast was good but breakfast room could be bigger or maybe a patio area for more seating . Pool area was very nice with plenty of towels and was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. One thing i should mention is that a couple days before my wife and i were supposed to stay there i realized i made reservations for the wrong dates ! I called Hotels.com and they contacted this hotel and made the change for the correct dates, thank you so much to Hotels.com and Country Inns And Suites for your understanding!"

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"not the best for dinner, but decent size rooms and a telly the size of our house!"
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Room was nice and comfortable, and wifi worked fine. Desk was reasonable efficient. Basic breakfast, no big deal. Evening coffee pretty mediocre. Nice staff. It met my needs for business travel, but is nothing special. Failed to receive 6 AM wakeup call!"
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Overall this hotel was great, but I had one problem with the front desk, and that problem I request crib for my 2 kids and they only gave me 1, I had to wait units the following day for the second crib."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"I spent five nights here. There's a lot of shopping and restaraunts nearby, most within walking distance. I like Hyatt Place, as they try to do things differently. The layout of the entire hotel feels different, such as the lobby and rooms. The free breakfast was very good and a nice perk."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Hotel was at capacity due to hurricane evacuees, so when we arrived our room was not yet ready. After a short wait we were all set. Staff was working very hard and the room was very clean and all furnishing in great condition. The hotel itself felt like it was 20-25 years old, but the room felt brand new. Hotel shuttle provided easy access to area for FREE. If we came back to town, we would definitely stay here again."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,The area was great and the hotel very comfortable
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,This hotel overall was amazing we even stayed an extra night! I really think the breakfast could have been better over the weekend. Monday breakfast was great!
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,Went to see a concert at Verizon they drop you off and pick you up. The shuttle took a few trips to get everyone there but we got there on time. Everyone was really nice and the rooms were very comfy.
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,Very close to shopping centers like notth point mall
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Life Fitness equipment... one bike, two treadmills and one elliptical.  You can almost always get on something, not that crowded.  Hyatt provides towels and water.  Some a bit of floor space."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"We had to switch from 2 other nasty hotels with 24 hours. Keona, helped with reservations over the phone and I was totally impressed.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"The elevators were not working during our stay. We were told that a 2nd floor room was available, but we were given a 6th floor room anyway.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,It was a small mini vacation for me and I absolutely loved my stay there. The staff was friendly every time we walked in the door.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,smile at the staff and they will smile back. wonderful with kids.
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"We stayed at the Hyatt because it was close to and offered shuttle service to the Verizon amphitheater. Our room was very clean, roomy, and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed our stay very much."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"all aspects were easy fast--everything we needed was there very clean. service was excellent, but very unobtrusive. the sleeper sofa was not the best bed but allowed us to share the room with elderly parents they had a good king size bed. we would definitely stay here again when visiting my sister."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Overall a very good stay with the exception of the elevators not working. Staff could have been a little more welcoming but good overall. Rooms were clean and location was good, within walking distance to lots of eateries and shops"

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Booked via the large global firm I work for at a very reasonable price. Bed and shower where good, location was handy but everything else was suspect.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"My husband, being a gold card member, always chooses Hyatt when we are planning a non-extended stay. This was a poor excuse for a Hyatt.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,Jack Lives Here!
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,We had a great time. Staff was very nice. Room was clean. My only beef which is super small was that we can down for breakfast around 920 and the majority of the breakfast had already been put up and had to be set back out for us and it was cold. Breakfast was served until 10. Otherwise. Awesome.
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,Most of staff is really just rude. Pick somewhere else to stay. Seriously.
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,I am floored by the negative comments on the staff. Been here twice and couldn't ask for better staff.
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"The hotel staff was extremely friendly. This hotel was completely full due to displaced people from Hurricane Matthew and it appeared they were working extra hard to accommodate such a large occupancy. Breakfast was good, but only 1 salt shaker for the entire dining area was a bit of a problem. The only other downside is that the parking lot is not well lit in the evening and if you are a single lady it's a bit frightening to walk through when you return in the evening. Something really should be done about that!"
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,Horrible staff
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"The rooms are great, beds were comfy, big sectional sofa. We were there for a family wedding. The breakfast was tasty. Convenient location. The staff was very friendly and accommodating I would not change a thing."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,We booked 10 rooms as a group and we got there and they had canceled 5 of our rooms and had some of us staying only one night instead of 2.All that was said was oh well we booked up.Got passed that only to return to our room which has a do not disturb sign to find that the cleaning...

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,this place must have been renovated and restaffed because i never witnessed anything other people are saying about this place.

Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"The room was quite nice, the coffee at the breakfast bar was really good (not the room coffee though). The breakfast bar was quite good and quick. All my needs were met. Thanks! The ONLY con was the A/C cycling from dead quiet to very loud. All else was great."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Not the best for dinner, but decent size rooms and a telly the size of our house!"

More
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"The room was nice large, clean, and modern. However, they were a little rude to us upon checking in, and then there seemed to be something wrong with the card reader on the door. I must've had to have them make 20 keys - not even joking. It wasn't quite the relaxing weekend I was hoping for when I had to constantly run up and down the stairs because the key wouldn't work. And no, we did not have the keys by phones or magnets or anything like that - the keys worked fine for the pool and side doors, etc. It was just our room door that had issues."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,"Clean and safe, with modern furnishings and easy access to 400, stores and restaurants. There us plenty of parking, the location was quiet and they served a warm breakfast. Overall, a very satisfying stay."
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,As expected for a Hyatt Place!
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,No outlets close to the bed. Weird at least!
Hyatt Place Atlanta/alpharetta/north Point Mall,I was very tired from driving to Atlanta and then rushing to a concert...so it was great to get here fast and have everything really nice. No issues!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,a nightmare for the most part
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The hotel staff were very kind and the free breakfast was pretty good. The hotel room was extremely outdated and needed some work, but for a one night stay it did the job."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,I was disappointed the pool and hot tub were out of order. My boys were very disappointed.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Anaheim Travelodge was the best accommodation we had in the USA The free breakfast was great, it is easy walking distance to Disneyland and the bus stops out the front if you're tired. Also the luggage storage is very helpful."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"It short but it was nice. Love the area everything was walking distance. Great customer service, rooms were nice"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,This was the worst hotel I stayed at and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests. I woke up to see a cockroach on my drink and had to throw out all the snacks I purchased. I complain to the front desk and they gave me a card with the corporate office information so that I can write an email. That is not customer service!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"good, but they did not give shampoo and the last day I found a cockroach in one of the beds"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The room was old the towels and bed sheets were old and were nasty. The staffs were not friendly at all and never smile at you. The breakfast were suck too.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Very bad place .. Parking free but you can't park .. Wifi free but you can't connect .. Breakfast free but their is no thing to eat
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Very nice stay.....
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"We have stayed here in the past, and it was always ok, but this stay was disappointing. First of all, we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the park. We were told a room was ready, but we'd have to pay a 25 early check in (what the heck!) Never heard of this before. We decided to pay because we wanted to go on the park for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car. Also, the room wasn't exactly clean... It was cleanish, but not exactly clean... The hotel ice machines were broken, then we were sent to the office (per housekeeping) to get ice, and they were out... Not cool. It was a hot weekend, and all of their ice machines weren't working Hmmm... Their continental breakfast was terrible. All they had was undercooked waffles, two kinds of cereal, tiny muffins and bread for toast... All carbs... no protein whatsoever, and no fruit. Not exactly a healthy breakfast. The whole hotel looked awful. They definitely need to invest money into their hotel to make it look smell better. Sadly, that was our last stay at this Travelodge. We stayed at the Super 8 down the road recently, they at least offer fruit and yogurt for breakfast (along with a variety of other pastries, waffles, and cereals), and they're in the process of remodeling. We'll be staying there from now on."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"room was quite clean but in poor condition. Only fan/light worked in bathroom and was extremely loud to point when taking a shower was aggravating for the mere 5 minutes. The water literally trickled out of shower head. bathroom door was in poor condition. bed was fairly comfy. carpet was very old, again poor condition and wouldn't walk barefoot on it. The room was very clean but needed a renovation 10 years ago jacuzzi was broken too.."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Good breakfast and staffs. I would stay here again. Price is decent. Don't take Disney owned bus just take a regular city bus.adventure park was fun.,we will be back for Disneyland. My family enjoyed staying at the travelodge. We recommended to everyone."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,No water pressure Faucet falling off Mattress hard as a rock Pillows gave me a headache Ladies working at Continental breakfast were great
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The hotel was filthy and smelled real bad. I'm glad it was only one night.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,My room had a sink that would clog. It also leaked from underneath the sink onto the floor. I advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day. I was there for three nights and it was never fixed. The shower water pressure was very low and came out as a drizzle. The temperature fluctuated while taking a shower as well from cold to very hot and to cold again. The bed felt very lopsided. The pillows where old and collapsing and smashed. There was little flying nats or bugs flying around in the room. I will never stay there again and will advise all those that I know and don't know to not stay there as well.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Rooms were stinking with dampness
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Wasn't told about an extra 100.00 deposit because I'm 21 years old. Pool and spa not working was looking forward to a swim. That's why I got this hotel over another one. Very unhappy overall. Staff talked down to me. I feel it was an age thing but I have been traveling with my family all over the world since I was 6 months old so I am a experienced traveler.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Clean rooms, reasonable price, close proximity to Disneyland, restaurants, fast food places, the freeway. I really liked the convenience of our hotel. I would probably stay here again."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"First of all do not leave a cash deposit they will try to keep it! I have stayed there many times with no problems but this last stay was a nightmare. I went to check out and obtain my deposit the front desk sent someone to my room to check it. I was then told I would not get my deposit back because the room smelt like Marijuana. Not smoke but Marijuana. I am 5 months pregnant and had my two year old son in the room. They noticed my husband smoking outside of the room in my car and assumed he was smoking in the room. I was crying and furious about losing my 200 deposit. I was told they wouldn't be able to rent the room out yesterday after we left because of the smell, we'll guess what the room was occupied when I called last night so where did my deposit go"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,They gave another guest a key that opened my room. That guest opened my room in the middle of the night scaring my family. The gust then told me that gave us the wrong key. So disappointed!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Room size was great, shower head was great, beds were fine. Only downfall was the lighting. Was too dim for makeup application and carpets felt dirty so I had 2 wear sandles if I walked. Overall, clean room."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Pool was broken..
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Only downside was the room had no minifridge. We have to eat!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"My stay at this hotel was short of expectations. I did not get all the advertised amenities, i.e microwave oven, refrigerator, pool access. Guests and sou rounding areas were noisy (with building's construction noise all night long). On the other hand, attendants were courteous and helpful. Overall, yes it's just a two star place but it could be easily turn into a three stars for a happy return when planning on visiting Anaheim's Convention Center or the Disney park."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"It was very quiet, even though we were on the street level. The staff was very nice and very helpful.There was plenty of parking. Most importantly I would stay again."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"This place was exactly what you pay for. Rooms are clean comfortable, a little dated ,but for price and proximity to Disney it's great. Had no problems feeling un safe, breakfast is a nice touch staff makes you fresh waffles on request. Only bad things are it's a little noise and in parking lot Someone vomited near our car splashing all over it. Other than that hotel was fine gets the job done."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Great
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Shuttle to Disneyland right outside the hotel, very convenient! Wasn't to happy that there weren't any toothbrushes supplied. Pillows are half the size of regular pillows, but they give you 4 of them. Complimentary breakfast left little to be desired, but there's a Denny's next door. Overall, didn't spend too much time in the hotel as most of the trip was spent in Disneyland, but I would definitely return to this hotel for the price and convenience."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Not the first time I've stayed here. Probably our 5/6th time. Three rooms to get it right. First one didn't lock second didn't have a working tv. Washer stained my clothes bc it clearly didn't rinse or spin properly and dryer ate my money. Didn't complain about washer bc hey it happens but dryer ate my 8 quarters and hotel staff did not believe me. What would I get out of lying not to mention I got all my quarters for my one load from the front desk.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Great location close to Disney
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Just a quick family trip the shower was horrible one minute it would fine then it would be scolding or freezing front desk knew about the problem and didn't seem to care
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The first room we were placed I. Had stains on the sheets and didn't appear to have been cleaned. We also saw a baby roach be changed rooms but still felt uncomfortable.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The location was great, but the room was much less then to be desired. Upon arrival at the front desk, you receive a welcoming from the staff, the front desk/reception area has clearly had a renovation, so I got the feeling that the rooms would be just as nice. When I got to my room, I was not pleasantly surprised, most of the fixtures were very worn and needed a major facelift. The bathroom was clean but the dressing area was disgusting, I didn't even want to use the sink, there was crud around the handles and the spicket was full of hard water build up, there was no water pressure, which isn't unheard of, but I would expect to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner. Floors were beyond disgusting, (wear shoes at all times) and the bed linens were just as I expected, the sheets were clean but the covers were reused. Overall not a bad place, I've stayed in worse, happy I was only there to rest, but the few amenities they had could have been updated, for the price, I would assume they are getting ready to renovate, at least I really hope so. The location is great and close to everything, the bus for Disney is outside the hotel and takes you right to the front."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"If you have kids or prefer to NOT be burnt badly by scolding hot water... do NOT stay here!I understand when you stay at a motel the water preasure isnt one to be desired however the water temperature should NOT go from a comfortable temp to scolding hot multiple times during a quick shower! I am so glad I was the one to get burnt first and not my kids or you'd be getting more than just a bad review! Also, we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the pool was out of order the entire time... get your s!t together! We ended up leaving early and staying at the best western next door which I highly recommend!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"This hotel requires a deposit prior to staying when you check in. 100 with credit, or 200 paying cash. We had no idea this was required and it put a dent in our financial plans for our trip. Also, the parking spaces are SMALL. We own a mini van and were called at 1am to move our car so someone else could park next to us. We had 2 babies with us which we felt was extremely rude to wake up. My husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the next morning, a truck parked so close we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit. Lastly, when checking out, we weren't even asked how our stay was."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Overnight stay in Anaheim to visit with an old friend and watch the Angel's play. For the price I paid for and what came included-- WiFi and breakfast, it was worth the cost as I wasn't looking for much in high end amenities. The toilet basin wasn't filling up and was causing some flushing issues. Front desk was made aware of it and resolved it after I checked out. I was literally here for 12 hours and no complaints. And it was quiet."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"It was a great place to relax during down time. Fast food and restaurants were in walking distance. Close to freeways. Room was spacious and clean, coffee maker in room with microwave and fridge. Breakfast smelled good and yummy."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,I had a great time staying here. The only bad thing I could say was the pool was closed which really sucked because it was super hot and it was summer time and the staff people were really rude.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,It was ok My girls wanted to jump in the pool but the employee said it was close due to some maintenance issues I recommend them to change the carpet it was dirty.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,A bit far from Disneyland to walk.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The rooms were good size, not very clean due to old used bar soap and washcloth still in shower. Room has mold smell constantly. The staff was professional and nice"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"I PLANNED MY TWO NITE STAY AROUND THE HEATED POOL JACUZZI,but they were both O.O.O.,( out of order,,,)THE OLD SCHOOL T.V. was hard to watch,the Waffles were the only thing that was good about my stay...I asked the Front Desk girl for a Pen. She offered me a non-hotel pen,so I asked for a Travelodge Pen...Also, when I checked in, the desk clerk told me I could use the Pool their sister hotel, Ramada Inn,,but it to was closed for repairs maintenance... So Ghetto,,,"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Overall, the Travelodge wasn't bad, this biggest issue was the 100 hold placed on my card at the beginning of the stay that I was not told about beforehand, and then the 3 day wait to get it cleared after checkout. This was already a budgeted vacation and that was not expected."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The Good: Price was cheap (70/night). The hotel is a convenient 10 minute walk to the Disney Toy Story parking lot. Leave your car at the hotel and save 18/day parking fee with an easy 10 minute walk to the Disney Toy Story parking lot at S Harbor and Convention to catch the free shuttle to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure. There are several restaurants nearby (Denny's right next door) and the area seems quite safe. The Bad: I've never stayed in a hotel room that was so dirty. I should say filthy. Carpet is in desperate need of replacement and leaves stains on your socks. Dental floss in sink, which had the drain stopper out on the counter and was clogged. Work was going on in the next door room (hammering) until I went next door to ask them when they planned to stop around 9p. The Ugly: I stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very dirty."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Bed was incredibly hard and made sleeping difficult. Room needs an update - wallpaper peeling, tile cracked, stains in shower."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Room was stinky like mold, found a roach. Bathtub wouldn't drain. Check-in took about 45 minutes credit card system was not working."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"We were supposed to have a fridge and a microwave We did not get a fridge and the microwave was broken. The swimming pool and hot tub was broken the entire time we were booked. There breakfast was nice but it was the same everyday, a waffle, mini muffins and drink."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The first hiccup in this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly. It was very confusing and he kept changing the rules. First it was 100 cash or card. Then it was 200 cash or 100 on card. Then the room was horrible. The ceiling was extremely stained and some of the popcorn texture was falling. The bed was very uncomfortable. The a/c did work well and the breakfast was good.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"We chose this hotel for the breakfast. We had stayed here before and it was great. On this trip the breakfast was sorely lacking. There were only waffles (passed out by an attendant who gave ours to another guest twice), not so great pastries and cereal. We weren't expecting 5 star caliber, but we were expecting what we had experienced before. We won't stay again."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,It was bit pricey for a motel but taking into consideration the location (about 1/2 a mile from Disneyland) it was worth it. The room was very clean and accommodating. I had no issues or problems during my stay.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"While the location is great as it has free parking and is located within walking distance to one of the Disney parking areas with a free shuttle, that was about the only thing remarkable about this hotel. The room was dated and had the bare minimum done to make it worth sleeping in. Continental breakfast did have fresh waffles but other than than, toast, cereal, juice and milk were about all that was offered to go with it. Fortunately, there is a Denny's right next door. They may be doing some remodeling but what we saw on our stay was not enough to make me want to stay there again. Room price was relatively cheap compared to many others but worth it to pay more for a decent place to sleep."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Everything is great except the carpeted floor. Don't ever try to walk barefooted because my son's feet turns black after walking a few minutes. But I still recommend this place, nothing beats their price!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Visited this hotel on our recent trip to the disneyland. The basin amenities of Hotel was ok/good. Main selling point was it's proximity to the disneyland.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Easy to reach, quick check-in. Breakfast more than i expected fir this type of hotel"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The hotel room was very clean but the sink smelled like sewer, every time an adjacent or upstairs room uses the bath there is a really loud gurgling noise coming from our bathtub drain. Continental breakfast was only bread, cereal and waffles, no meats or eggs, and the lady serving the waffles didn't look very friendly."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Great
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,pool was closed.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"room it s ok, my comment A/C NOT WORKING i have fun all night long pls. guys chick room 208 A/C NOT GETTING COLD......."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,It was very noisy!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"My friend and I were out most of the day, so I would say that overall it was a good experience. The receptionists were nice and helpful. The room was spacious. There was enough parking."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The rooms were very clean, the t.v. is old school but it has A Lot of channels to choose from. Breakfast ends at 10 which gives you enough time to get ready. The price is not bad at all. Overall a good stay , we will definitely come back .."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,the people are nice but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,No problem anything was ok.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The room seems very used and uncomfortable. Bed felt sunken in and old I won't be returning.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,This travel lodge is obviously cashing in on the Disneyland revenue but letting the place run down. The room showed a broken into room door which was poorly repaired. The curtains had holes in them from age. The bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with the water turning cold and hot and cold again in the shower. Add the old CRT TV and my conclusion was the owners are just interested in maximizing profits at the expense of its boarders. The front facade looks great but the hotel is run down. May be worth 50.00 per night at the most.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Very disappointed that the pool was closed for repair mid summer, breakfast choices were poor, our room smelled bad and was dirty. Based off pictures on the internet it was not what I expected. We will not stay ther again"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Family stay.. Requested two rooms with double queens, non-smoking, refrigerator, microwave, single cup coffee maker,flat screen TV, coffee, danishes, and waffles served in the morning. Pool access and nice customer service at the check in."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Felt uncomfortable about signing the list of all the different charges that could be made when we arrived.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,We had 3 rooms. Ours was dark. Hard to put make up on with two bulbs out. Not enough lighting in the rest of the room. We all agreed the bathroom fans were loud (jets) air conditioners were rackety noisy. But we still had a decent night.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"My wife and I are frequent visitors to the Disney parks and have stayed at 9 different hotels in the neighborhood, varying from 3 1/2 star hotels across the street to 2 star hotels a good distance away. Overall, this hotel is our absolute favorite place to be when we visit Disney. It is a slightly longer walk (20-25 minutes) than most people would like, but the value added here is definitely worth an extra ten minutes of walking. First, the service here is wonderful. The front desk is always very helpful and willing to accommodate requests. They also have free parking and free breakfast, and the breakfast actually has options and enough food to cover an entire meal. It is not a grab and go style to gives you a mini muffin and cup of coffee, but actually allows you and your family a free meal that also helps with budgeting trips. Also, we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with cleanliness. The beds are comfy and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great. It is a little noisy, but simply leaving the fan on gives enough white noise to be able to sleep. To anyone looking for a budget friendly option that is still close enough to the parks that you can walk every day, this is definitely worth checking out!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"The room was in much need of new furnishings and renovation. The carpet and corners of the carpets were filthy. You could see where items like the door lock, shower rod, and toilet paper holders had come down and then replaced without spackling and repairing of the wall. On the last night we were locked out of our room because the computerized door lock wouldn't read anyone's door card, even the management's card, and they knew all day that it needed fixed. It was not worth the price per night that we paid. The only perk were that the beds were comfortable, parking was free, and there was free wifi."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"This is a great hotel for Disneyland on a budget. The walk is deceivingly long, especially after walking in the parks all day. Getting an Uber or Lyft proved difficult for some reason, as the drivers constantly passed the hotel or pickup location at the parks, but this is not the hotel's issue."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,This hotel is great for Disneyland. Nothing fancy but is always clean and beds are comfy. No resort fees or parking fees which is nice. ART Bus stop is right out front which is very convenient. We've stayed here a few times and will continue to do so
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,don't pay to take the bus to disney land. walk about 1/3 of a mile up s harbor blvd to the toy story parking lot and ride the free shuttle from there.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,not bad for the price patkin is limited. as for the tip down below about cancer california has a law that says you have to post that. if your room has a tv the tv warning is posted
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Not bad at all !
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The location was perfect
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The breakfast had bugs in the packs of oatmeal. I told the attendant but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones. And the parking is crazy there's nowhere to park.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Room had lots of holes in the walls. Some patched up some not. Hard, scratchy towels. Our room was right next to the breakfast room, so very noisy starting 6am the following morning."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,I was there for busines meeting...
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Clean room, good value for money spent. There is a lot of easy access to other stuff around the area. Easy access to public transportation."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"just be careful on people at the front desk, one girl that there such a sweetheart and there one guy that work there horrible"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Ladies from the breakfast service were very nice and attentive. Hotel looks from outside, but furniture in room and rooms need a makeover!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Pretty decent. Breakfast was good. Beds were comfortable. Half of the light bulbs were out. I didn't understand why there was a security deposit, if the room was paid in full."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"My friends and I stayed 3 nights at the Travelodge for our trip to Disneyland. It was about a mile walk but right next to a Denny's which was convenient. The room itself was very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable. We were looking forward to using the pool area, but of course it was closed (for repairs). The people in the room next to us were very loud throughout the night and in the morning which was annoying. The fridge and microwave worked well. The shower was not very clean and the water temperature was either very hot or luke warm depending on the time of the day. The wifi did not work well, so we couldn't even really use it. Luckily, the outdated TV (not a flat screen) did have some great channels. Last but not least, the complimentary breakfast was a couple different cereals, small muffins (not good), and waffles with watered down syrup. We only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't worth going. Overall, if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day in Anaheim, then this place is great for the price but don't expect much."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"If you can get by with the just the bare basics.. you will be fine staying here. Literally bare minimum hotel! Just a place to sleep and shower only! 1 block to Disneyland, crazy cheap prices! That's the advantage of staying here. No pool!! You will see one.. it's filled and looks ok.. but cannot use..Overall, I would compare to bare minimum hostel! It is slightly better than sleeping in your car! Props for free wifi... weak, but still free.."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"further away from Disneyland than we thought, but close to Disney Toy Story parking lot with free shuttle which worked out ok. Pool and hot tub were closed for repair which was a bummer! Free continental breakfast wasn't the greatest, but ok. Room was huge and really nice. King size bed was very comfortable. AC worked great and kept us nice and cool. Would probably stay there again because of great price."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"dirt cheap, but clean."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Front desk attendant unfriendly, bathtub faucet and drain control faulty, pillows to hard for comfort, breakfast barely adequate. Amenities inappropriate for 100 a night."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,advertised a king room. gave us a double bed room. when we complained they claimed they don't offer a king room when we clearly showed them our itinerary.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,get a parking spot early
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,heck you pay more to stay in the disneyland resort & you don't even get a mint.this place was just fine.we rolled into bed when the parks closed & rolled back out in enough time to grab a light...
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,motel 6 is a cleaner and more updated than this travel lodge location
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"bad hotel, the hierarchy end management sucks, they don't get things done proerly, just need be very careful when booking or anything at this place"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Requested a downstairs or lower floor- when we arrived and mind you we called letting them know we would be late getting in. We were on the 3rd floor. The room was dirty, there wasn't any coffee cups or water cups. the roof had water damage. the door was not sealed and the sunlight came in long with the heat. the shower head was like a slow drip if you wanted to rinse you needed to fill the tub and rinse this way. Went down to get coffee and something to eat. The ladies there spoke Spanish very little English made two cups of coffee when doing so read how I could not leave with anything and go back to my room. walked over to make a waffle and the Spanish lady ran over and started yelling at me no, no, no I make these and pointed at the sign. Ah ok then you might want to stay over there lady and keep your post. There was no fruit very little to choose from. took coffee cups to my room and didn't care what they had to say about it, I would have reminded them they didn't do a great job on the room as it wasn't clean and ready for the guess. Will not ever be coming back to this place and would not refer anyone to stay here. Wyndem owns this place and it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them. they don't care how it looks just wants your money."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"They have a nice pool area that was closed our entire visit. We discovered this when we tried to use it. The breakfast area was also closed. We discovered that our first morning here. There was a paper arrow taped on the locked breakfast area door that pointed toward the dumpster across the parking lot. My family scoured the area but found no alternative breakfast room. It was 6:15 in the morning and the front desk was closed so we ended up going to Denny's next door. Our toilet kept running when flushed so I had to open up the back, stick my hand in and correct the problem."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Our two night stay was good! We arrived at 10pm. We were welcomed with a friendly front desk receptionist. Beds were comfy. Room was quite spacious, although needs to be updated. However, extremely clean. The only thing we delt with was our bathroom fan kinda had a mind of its own, it would come on and turn off when it wanted to, which wasn't a big deal for us at all. The room we were in was on the first floor facing the parking lot and three rooms away from the dinning area and it was super quiet! Even though we didn't use this feature, the hotel surprisingly had room service!! However, there is a Dennis restaurant right next door. It was a 5 Uber ride from Disneyland to the hotel."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Finding a parking spot is a pain! Even though service was ok, front desk people's faces and attitude were not very friendly! Price was fair so you get what you pay for!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The hotel is ok. I think the rooms need to be updated but for the price it was ok.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,very very ghetto we will never book here again... they say continental breakfast it's only cereal or doughnut crapy place...did i say ghetto well yea it is...they didn't clean the bathroom...
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Well over all it was a good stay even though I got a surprised 100 deposit asked of me when checking in. The girl at the desk was not very friendly and people could find the way she spoke rude. They ask you for 100 on a credit card or 200 cash. It for damages to the room. Like to grown responsible middle age men are going to damage the place really. On a good note the breakfast is great they provide waffles, cereal, juices, coffee and toast including mini muffins."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Bed was extemely comfortable. Breakfast was one of the worst continental breakfasts I've seen and the toilets were great for small children not for adults.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"I appreciated the receptionists' services they were really nice even at midnight when I checked in. Otherwise, there were some disadvantages such as terrible smell in the room we were stay the telephone didn't work at all the shower curtain was not waterproof so that water observed and flew down the floor the AC worked just fine there were not enough parking spaces for all guests. Anyway, the location is great. There are a lot restaurants nearby and it takes just about 5 mins to drive or walk to Disney Land."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,....breakfast and back to the parks. tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a 5 star while only paying for a 1 star. get over yourself or just stay home.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,I really like the hotel but the only thing that we are not happy the fect that the pool wasn't working specily with this hot weather. Thad the only complaint
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Pool and the jacuzzi out of service during my stay. This was noted on the travelodge website, but Hotels.com missed it"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"THis Time at Travel lodge was Horrible,No working Wifi, NO Pool or Spa working,Blow dryer NOT working,Coffee machine broke,Bath room lights 1/2 working,Bathroom vent non working,NO Parking after we return from Disney, was told have to park behind other car and move my car in the morning they call me and say Move car for other guest,,Staff not NICE,did not clean our Room one day.Spa and Pool NOR working and was told not there problem..This TRIP was Horrible Becouse of this Hotel and stay was NOT good,we should be refunded a portion or all of what we paid,NO reason all this went on and They didnt care."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Room was clean, but had a smell of urine. Room could use a paint over, and door trims replaced to ensure locks stay in place and secure."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"read the signs posted outside the hotel rooms. ""rooms contain materials known to cause cancer and birth defects."" also, the rooms are ghetto. you get what you pay for has never been more accurate."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"stay away from room 317! it's haunted by a woman spirit...even my moms phone wouldn't work in there, but it did in my uncle's room..."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"made the reservation only 2 days ago. we arrived today-big,clean room with parkinglot for about 40 dollars/night. great deal."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The hotel is okay. 5 min. walk to the Disneyland parking and you can take the free shuttle to the parks there. Free WiFi so that's a plus. Be aware that they charge you a 100 deposit when you check-in which is not mentioned here.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,This hotel is great for the price. A bit of a walk to DL but you can catch free bus at Toy Story parking.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Not staying here again. We arrived very late at night so made do, but were not happy with our stay. The linens on one of the beds were used and dirty, had not been replaced. There were lots of maintenance issues in the room, holes in the walls, missing fiextures etc. The staff was rude, the desk clerk was very short, and discurteous at checkout, and a member of the cleaning staff was extreamly rude. As we were leaving our room, she cut my wife and son off, telling them to, and i quote, move. The breakfast was horrible as well. Theye were out of several things, the waffless they prepared for the guests were overcooked, and the milk was either old, tainted, or there was something altering the taste in the dispense, it was inedible. We will never stay here again."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Our stay at travelodge was pretty great. It's not the best hotel out there, but you get what you pay for. A room close to Disneyland that's not going to break your bank. Disneyland and California Adventure are within walking distance, but there are two shuttles nearby that can take you straight there. The room was quaint, a little dated, but again you get what you pay for. All in all our stay was great and the hotel workers were very helpful."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"if your room has a table and it is in front of the ac unit, move it. it will make your room cooler!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,room 124 was nice and clean! downside....only one car per room allowed to park in the hotel parking lot!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,be prepared to line up for waffles as they are made by an attendant.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Very dirty and not kept up.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Pleasant staff
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,ok l.here's the thing.you didn't pay for a luxury hotel so you're not staying in a luxury hotel. you paid as little as possible & you got exactly that.a continental breakfast is not a 5 star breakfast
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"excellent staff, close to disney shuttle but pool spa were closed for the entire week were there"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"we stay 2 night's the hotel it's really close to Disneyland, big parking lot and close to restaurants"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The room was decent for the price. The air in the room was a bit musty.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Beds were horrible and NOT queens. Shower nob was loose and hard to control hot/cold and fluctuated the 2 throughout the shower. Burning hot/ice cold. Breakfast was generic: muffins, rolls and waffles. (Controlled by staff member) No fresh fruits or yogurts options."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"yes this is not the ritz, but it's a great hotel for the money! especially when you are spending 10-14 hours at disneyland and only use it to sleep and get clean! great quick free breakfast!!"
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Not very good. The rooms look nothing like the website. Parking was horrible.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Not enough parking spaces for the number of rooms. If you come back late evening be prepared to stack park.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"Clean room, the breakfast was too basic and never changed any...only waffles and mini muffins and cereal."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,It was great hotel was good and clean
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"We went through 3 rooms to get an A/C that worked. The sink was rusty, the beds were uncomfortable. You were able to see all the wires that were painted at an attempt to hide them. I felt like that was unsafe if i had small children. The staff was friendly. We didn't spend much time on our room, we spent most of our time at Disneyland. You get what you pay for with this location."
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Beds were very hard and the pool was down. Not a bad hotel over all.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The breakfast was great they had their employees make our Waffles and they were cooked very good didn't have to wait long to eat.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Free wifi didn't work
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Overall the room was great! There was even a small refrigerator and microwave! The only problem was the parking Saturday night we were practically parked on the sidewalk.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,worst hotel experience ever. 2 months in advance booking plus check in call still got the wrong room w/broken lights. upgraded to a suite w/a broken toilet & sofa bed. the parking is terrible here!
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,The hotel was very reasonably priced and close to Disneyland. You can catch the shuttle at the satellite Disneyland parking lot a block away. The free continental breakfast was disappointing.
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Convenient and near restaurants and Disneyland
Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,"2 roaches joined us. The breakfast is a joke. We had to go elsewhere. No fruit, no protein nothing healthy at all! Staff in office were on personal cell phones. Staff not very helpful about local transportation. You'd think they would learn the major route to local amusement parks"
Quality Inn,"This is a lovely hotel that unfortunately smells horribly of smoke. We had a non smoking room, but the hallway outside smelled as if people had been smoking right there. We were able to get an extra towel to put up against the door which helped a little. Unfortunately, even the pillows smelled of smoke. Not good for an asthmatic. That being said the people were lovely, the rooms nicely furnished, and it was easy to get to from I-81."
Quality Inn,"Great rest stop. The bed was very comfortable and the ac was nice and quiet. The room was also very clean. There was a very loud siren that woke us up in the middle of the night(not the hotels fault, it came from the city.) so I am not sure it goes of every night or what it was for. But anyway it was a great hotel!"
Quality Inn,It was good. breakfast was good with fresh sausage and biscuit Hope the room has microwave to be perfect
Quality Inn,"First room they put us into smelled like mold, and mildew. Perhaps it was because the ceiling was falling through from a 4 foot wide water damage from the air conditioning unit in the room above ours. Once I went to the front desk they did put us into a new room, but this problem should have been taken care of before someone was put into it. A cleaning maid should have made a note that this room was not fit for use."
Quality Inn,"needs work and updating. bathroom was dirty, and floors were dirty. jetted tubes were no were to be found as advertised for all rooms. I guess you get what you pay for."
Quality Inn,"Refrigerator not working. Basic room, no frills, okay for price. The continental breakfast was good but staff could not keep up with the amount of people there. Continually running out of coffee, food. The staff was pleasant enough. Check out time was 11:00 but cleaning staff trying to get in my room 2 times at 10:45."
Quality Inn,"Off highway location for busy travellers. Clean rooms, comfortable beds, free breakfast. Off you go!"
Quality Inn,"Nice but older motel. Would be better if updated. Nice big tv , but reception was bad. Room was clean and bed was good."
Quality Inn,"Came down from New Jersey for a family reunion. Hotel was in decent shape. I wasn't expecting presidential suite style here, but I was fairly impressed. Decor was dated but in decent condition. My only real complaint was that the hotel seemed extremely understaffed. Took almost 20 minutes before someone showed up for us to checkout. Hallways had an odd scent but not overpowering. Could be due to age."
Quality Inn,"My son and I were just passing through town on our way to PA where he attends University. As usual, I booked a non-smoking room, which was confirmed at check-in. It was clear however that the room was, at best, a 'converted' smoking room (it was room 115 if you want to know). In addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in the room, the bathroom was extremelly smelly. It was interesting to note that all the rooms but ours had a room number with a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it (hmmmm...) Room 115 was also at the beginning of the 'smoking' rooms along the hallway, and if I remember correct, the room across the hall was a smoking room. We'd already checked and the only other comperable room was a true smoking room, so we bucked up and stayed the night. I'll be avoiding this Comfort Inn on any future trips."
Quality Inn,"Nice comfortable hotel, with good breakfast buffet."
Quality Inn,Stopped here on a road trip and unfortunately had no time to research. Hotel and rooms were not so clean.
Quality Inn,Stopped here on a road trip and unfortunately had no time to research. Hotel and rooms were not so clean.
Quality Inn,The hotel was difficult to find. No sign at the main route . Was clean comfy. Pool area was under remodeling but the pool was heated soooo relaxing
Quality Inn,"I'm not a fan of hotels that get along with the bare minimum to keep a place running. It looks decent from the outside, but once inside you can tell that not much effort is put in, to making it pleasing. The carpet is old and smelly, walls are haphazardly painted, cracks everywhere, nothing feels super clean and fresh. I understand that it is a roadside hotel, but you should always want to present your business with your best foot forward. The name is actually Quality Inn, not Comfort Inn. Breakfast was okay. All in all, I wasn't impressed."
Quality Inn,Found wet towel on the chair in our room. Floor in lobby and hallways needed to be vaccumed. Breakfast was great.
Quality Inn,It was clean and quiet. It's not real deluxe but it served its purpose
Quality Inn,It was clean and quiet. It's not real deluxe but it served its purpose
Quality Inn,"I booked a room at Quality Inn in Radford, Virginia. I left about an 1 after check in. Here is why: Lady in front of me was getting money back due to bed bugs. Once I got in the room, I immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs. Upon inspecting the sheets I discovered long hair in both beds on the pillows and in the sheets. One of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets. I went down to ask for clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones. I waited an hours and 15 minutes and nobody came. When I went back to the counter, there were now two clerks and there seemed to be a lot of confusion. While I was there, a lady came to the front counter and actually brought a bed bug that she found in her room. I asked for a refund and left. This place was disgusting and I think the corporate office should seriously question the management of this location. I am happy to explain all of my observations. I have stayed in a lot of rooms and do not consider myself fussy, but this place was pathetic and nasty."
Quality Inn,"Good, clean, and close."
Quality Inn,"We just stayed one night, but we called to say we would arrive later than expected and the receptionist was work and assured us that our r onomastico would be waiting whenever we arrived. This was comforting because we were in a stressful situation. The atmosphere was simple and welcoming."
Quality Inn,There was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant. The equipment in the fitness center was in very poor condition. One treadmill did not work at all. The other was permanently stuck on an incline and digital display did not work. Overall the hotel had a shabby appearance.
Quality Inn,They use something like a plug in or cleaner in the rug which is over powering. I could not breathe. I felt like I was being suffocated by an air freshener. Obviously this is used to cover the stinch of being a smoker's hotel. The heat kept making a dripping noise. I think I slept about an hour the entire night.
Quality Inn,"Although my stay was above avg. I'd have to say they need to do something about their TV channels. The reception was terrible. Only 3 channels came in clear. That's rough when you're traveling alone with not much else to do! Very clean, could use some updates, service was great! Price great too!"
Quality Inn,"The personnel were very nice, but the hotel is old and really needs attention. It was no-vacancy all over the area for the day before Radford University move-in. Will try to plan ahead better and not have to stay there again - at least until they renovate."
Quality Inn,"safe door wouldn't stay closed causing a sharp tripping hazard, candy bar wrappers under the bed, bath room door stuck had to really pull to open it, previous guest left a baseball hat in the room... did the maid just make the bed and think that means clean!!!"
Quality Inn,The room was dirty and smelled terrible. I had to buy an air freshener just to be able to stand being in the room. The shower head was dirty and so was the comforter on the bed. I was afraid to walk on the bathroom floor barefooted for fear of getting a chemical burn or something. As soon as I turned on the shower I could smell some kind of chemical from the drain. It was the worst stay at a Quality Inn I've ever had.
Quality Inn,Hair on floor of bathrooms food in room on floor when we arrived
Quality Inn,"It's a hotel that is close to Virginia Tech. Other than that it needs a major face lift. Old rooms, somewhat dirty. I would not recommend staying there."
Quality Inn,"The staff was nice, the only good part of the experience. The hotel is in shabby, questionable shape. We had to take it as it was the only place accepting pets and we didn't have the energy to continue the day's journey. Poorly kept up, halls are dark and freezing, the property is aging and ridiculously neglected by the ownership. While I wasn't interested in a jetted tub, the listing touts it as a feature in their rooms, which is completely untrue. Not only was the tub not jetted, I didn't even want to use the tub or shower at all. I don't go into a standard motel with unfair expectations, but to pay 100 dollars for a dive is incredibly disappointing. Like I said, the staff was the only highlight. It's a shame they are saddled with having to work for a property owner with no interest in presenting a decent experience. Do your best to stay at one of the other nearby hotels in the vicinity in order to get any value for your money."
Quality Inn,"The staff was the best.We were on the road and grew tired.Arrived at this hotel 2 hours before check in. Front desk clerk called housekeeping and in 45 minutes a room was made ready! Breakfast staff made sure we had everything.The building is showing it's age,but did not affect our stay."
Quality Inn,General condition of hotel wasn't that good. Toilet didn't work well.
Quality Inn,"The hotel was ok ,it was close the area we were visiting and other was full."
Quality Inn,"adequate for the price. Good location near I-81 but not noisy and since it is at the end of a service road, no thru traffic....so it felt safe in that regard. Very dark in parking area on one side, so I moved my car each night to a better area. A little time-worn, but OK for the price."
Quality Inn,"After sitting in a car for 10 hours, I needed to exercise. Found 2 treadmills broken along with bicycle and stairsteper inoperable. Only elliptical worked barely."
Quality Inn,"We chose this hotel at the last minute when we were just too tired to keep driving to reach our destination. Other hotels in the area were already full so I didn't have a lot of choice. The outside of the hotel appeared clean and well maintained. The check in was fast and polite. This is a hotel so you have to go inside to get to your room. The carpets were pretty clean overall but there were some stains on the furniture and the walls/baseboards haven't been cleaned in some time. The calking was lose and in need a repair in several places. The basic daily cleaning tasks were done well though. The bed linens were clean as were the bathroom and towels. This room had all the basic appliances to make your stay comfortable including a mini fridge. Overall this hotel was above average for its price range but the beds in our room were creaky and old. Given this room price was at the top of the range for its hotel bracket, I expected a more comfortable bed. I've stayed at lower range places and slept better since the beds were better. For me the quality of the actual rest depends on the mattress and a poor mattress can ruin an otherwise great experience. I would stay here again if I needed a place to crash but not for the price I paid for this particular visit."
Quality Inn,This place is a dump. It is old and dirty. The grounds were full of weeds that were not mowed. We would not have stayed here had we seen it in person before we booked.
Quality Inn,"There isn't an elevator at this property. It could use some updating, the chair in our room was so stained and frayed that it would have made a better impression if there wasn't a chair at all. There was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom. The good thing was the water was hot and the water pressure was good. The bed was comfortable and the staff was friendly."
Quality Inn,Stopped to catch some rest. Soda machine ate my money but too tired to worry about asking for it back. Room was clean but hot initially AC worked well to make it comfortable. Bathroom was clean bedding although dated appeared clean. Comfortable night sleep. Breakfast was decent for a complimentary spread. Would stop again but not for extended stay. Checked it at midnight and out at 0930
Quality Inn,"When we checked in our reservation were made through Expedia even though we were told we were calling direct. They had charged it to a Master Card, which we do not even own and had charged 20 more than the room cost. The lady at the desk was very nice and our stay was okay. The room and bath needed some updating and a little paint."
Quality Inn,Had to walk a 50 yard hall to get to room because keypad was not working on outside door. No outside lighting next to rooms. (It wouldn't be safe to go your car or outside for any reason) Ice machine was not working on my side of the building so had to go to other side just to get ice. I spoke to someone who said both were in disrepair not long ago and guests had to go to the gas station to get bags of ice. Couldn't speak to room staff (they didn't speak any English). Was woken many times by other rooms using water.
Quality Inn,"Well...I had requested a non smoking room and got a smoking room. Didn't realize it was a smoking room until i saw the ash trays, but i knew it smelled of stale cigarettes. The pool was green. I know the hotel is old but it really needs to be renovated or closed. I would not recommend anyone to stay there."
Quality Inn,i hated it!
Quality Inn,"The lobby and hallways had no a/c. It was cooler outside, in July, than in the building. Fortunately, the room a/c did work. The rooms themselves were cramped and small, but clean for the most part. The breakfast was a good selection. We had to leave the pool on the only sunny day of our stay because the lawn guy was going to cut the grass (understandable) but he NEVER DID. No one seemed to have any ideas about things to do in the area when asked. The guest computer in the lobby hardly ever worked and when it did, you would fall asleep in the heat waiting for it to work. This was the only hotel we found with an outdoor pool in the area, but the pool was dinky and they had a broken down handicap lift chair but no diving board or slide or anything that said kids welcome. It was a miserable stay all the way around."
Quality Inn,Air condition didn't work (lady at desk was very helpful and got us another room). Furniture a bit shabby. Toilets are too low - my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up. Breakfast was ok - seating area too small.
Quality Inn,Rooms need updating
Quality Inn,"Only a one night stay in a small town so we were not looking for a lot.Very comfortable room, clean and near the Interstate."
Quality Inn,"The hotel was older and had some wear and tear but for the price a good stay. Pretty comfortable, pool was small but clean."
Quality Inn,Non-smoking means under a smoking room with apparently shared ventilation between the two. Furniture in the room was worn and stained.
Quality Inn,Front desk staff were extremely accommodating to my grandparents request for an accessible room near mine. Also one of very few hotels to accept cash payment without a credit card hold. The hotel itself is extremely run down and is in desperate need of an interior update. The hotel does otherwise serve its purpose for a quick overnight stay.
Quality Inn,Older property but reasonably well maintained. The carpet in our room was coming apart at a seam and a bit of wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling - but it was clean and comfortable.
Quality Inn,The entire hotel smelled like smoke.
Quality Inn,"Hotel was not filthy but definitely not what I would consider clean either. Front awning looked damaged, and carpet was pulled up in areas as well"
Quality Inn,"The smoke alarm starting beeping at 6 in the morning, had to get someone to come up and change battery. that was a rude awakening at 6 am! but other than that it was a good stay."

Quality Inn,"Quiet and clean, but hotel was in need of better maintenance. Door did not close properly. Hair dryer plug had a burnt place on it and looked loose and unsafe. Staff did not ask about stay at checkout."
Quality Inn,"Stayed here for a visit to a college with my daughter. At check in, lady in front of me was getting her money back because of bed bugs. When I checked into my room, sheets were slept in by previous tenant and there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed. When to front counter to ask for clean sheets. Waited an hour and lady never came. When back up to complain about sheets again, and a new lady had come to the counter from another room to complain about bed bugs. She actually brought one to the counter. I immediately checked out. I am extremely disappointed. I think corporate should take a serious look at what the hotel manager does at this site, clearly, she does not hold hotel staff accountable, if house keeping is allowed to make beds up without changing sheets between tenants. It is also very concerning that two people happened to complain about bed bugs both times while I was at the clerks front desk."
Quality Inn,"The staff at the Quality INN were wonderful. Hotels.com messed up my reservation and the front desk staff was nice enough to fix the problem and honor the price. There was a billing problem, caused by Hotels.com that the staff at Quality Inn fixed quickly. The hotel was a little run down but clean and peaceful, just what my husband and I were looking for! The breakfast was very good and offered a variety of options."
Quality Inn,"It smells bad. No hot water that night because broiler is down. Breakfast is terrible. Staff numbers are nice. Especially, the kitchen lady."
Quality Inn,"The air conditioning was really hard to control it was either freezing or off. The pillows were tiny and uncomfortable, and there was a piece of iron frame sticking out of the bed that we kept getting bruised on. The fan in the bathroom was loud and rattly, and it was on the same switch as the light. The housekeeping staff was excellent, and were good at replenishing supplies. There was a fridge that kept drinks really cold, and ice packs frozen. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful."

Quality Inn,"The stay was very pleasant. The website stated deep tubs but that was not the case. That was only for jacuzzi rooms which was a up charge, Which I did. The room was dated and needed a face lift. But other reviews already mentioned stuff like carpet and dated stuff so I wasn't surprised. The room was good for what it was. The continental breakfast was poor but people at the service desk was good and very helpful. Other then that only other thing was rooms are not used that often and when filling tub up water was brown because of recent rain but cleared up. Would definitely stay again."

Quality Inn,"An older facility but not run down. Room was clean with fresh smelling linen. Why we get only 2 well worn wash cloths, a faucet that twists all ways in your hand and turns off at a different location every time The need for profit at lower rates drives down the quality making it impossible to purchase goods and services...

Quality Inn,"The motel is well located just off I75. the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was the usual overnight motel fare with waffles, cereal etc. The staff is genuinely nice. there is nothing that separates this motel from a thousand others in its class. It is adequate and a good rate. They do allow pets for a fee."
Quality Inn,Good clean Motel just off I-75. Staff always courteous and helpful. Rooms always clean and comfortable beds. Free breakfast is average but always good. Close to Cracker Barrel and several other restaurants. We stay here on our travels north and back.
Quality Inn,"We just needed a place to stay on our way home. For the price, we really didn't expect much more than room and shower. The outside of this motel belies the beautifully redone the interior. The lobby was clean and neat.

Quality Inn,staff was so bad at desk I walked out in discuss. multiple people in line. 2 staff but serviced only one at time people were backlogged due to lost reservations cannot believe how inept they were I stood in line like 30 minutes waiting only to be told they had no rooms.

Quality Inn,"The rooms were clean and beds were good. The breakfast was same as similar facilities. The staff was very polite and helpful. This is an excellent location, right off 475 Macon bypass. There are many restaurants nearby."
Quality Inn,"1st night awakened by call from my cell phone, from a gentleman representing Quality Inn, stating that I had reserved a room and when was I coming to get it I explained already checked in. The phone number was a local area code, but was not hotel number. The front desk was baffled by who called 2nd morning, another guest used security card and was coming into our room! Found out, somehow, we had been checked out the day before, so we were not registered as guests. At that point, we checked out because we did not feel safe! We then proceeded to check into another hotel in area."
Quality Inn,Desk clerk spoke very little english. Could not pronounce my first or last name and when I corrected him he developed an attitude with me. Rooms were fair. I would not stay there again. For a Quality Inn Hotel it was very low class.
Quality Inn,Staff were friendly which made up for the fact that I had to change rooms tv and phone did not work. Not very sound proof.
Quality Inn,"Desk clerk was wonderful, he went above and beyond. Breakfast was good. Room was clean. I was nervous because of the many bad reviews...but we didn't have any issues. The hallway did smell like smoke but I believe it was due to this hotel still having smoking rooms. Our room did not smell of smoke. Only downside was no elevator, so pack light or be prepared to haul luggage up stairs!"
Quality Inn,"This was the ONLY hotel room available in town that night. It's old, run down, sketchy. The smell of smoke permeates the hallways, the rooms. You have to pull all top bedding off the bed out of fear it's not been laundered. The man checking me in and lady checking me out at front desk were pleasant, but not overly. I couldn't wait to leave and thankful I was only in need of some sleep a shower."
Quality Inn,"A friend recommended this hotel for its cleanliness. This was a nice stay for the money. Our room was very clean, beds and pillows were comfortable. Lady at the desk was a little rude, but I think that was just her personality. I would stay here again."
Quality Inn,"Short somewhat unsweet. Upon arrival the temperature in both rooms we booked was higher than outside which was 95 degrees. A/C was turned on and one hour later one was still not working. First trip to front desk we were told to let it run a little longer and I told the lady it was not going to work we needed maintenance and I would wait in lobby until he arrived. 10 minutes later after maintenance inspection/conclusion, old unit/not working and was told this is normal in India.I DON'T LIVE IN INDIA. I went back to front desk and asked for another room. The lady gave us another room and was very curtious. Problem with this hotel is the owners are cheap, everything was unplugged, so at first we thought nothing worked.I would recomend that before booking your hotel with an agency to find out if the owners are from India. I speak from experience. It is better to spend an extra 50 for comfort, than to feel like you have been robbed. You are on vacation, cut back someplace else not lodging."
Quality Inn,The beds were like sleeping on brick floors. There are at least three other hotels that are half of the price within walking distance of this hotel. The one very good thing I would say was the service from the staff very friendly
Quality Inn,Our non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes.... not very clean. Breakfast was ok.
Quality Inn,"NO elevator, so ask for a first floor room. The upstairs hallway smelled like smoke, even though our non smoking room was on the 2nd floor. They need NEW TOWELS......every towel is frayed completely on the edges and are falling apart, THey also need new sheets. Pillowcases worn so badly that you can literally see thru parts of them."
Quality Inn,Decent. Staff was friendly and helped accommodate requests.
Quality Inn,No mention whatsoever upon check-in that the entire second floor was under renovation fresh paint smell. Hallways and rooms were extremely hot Took 3 to 4 hours to get the room down in temperature to be able to rest comfortably Mentioned to manager in the morning his response was well I told the guy the check to you in the shouldn't put you up there. sounds like a labor issue as well as lack of customer service

Quality Inn,Had 3 roaches crawling on the walls! The main problem was the room was 150 degrees at 10pm at night!! The air was off and it took until after midnight to even be able to fall asleep because so hot!
Quality Inn,"We stayed over for a night on our way to Florida. The hotel rooms are clean, it is next to the freeway so there is road noise."
Quality Inn,The air conditioner did not function properly in the room and the air in the halls was stale and musty.
Quality Inn,"The pool was green and seemed to happily support the local amphibious wildlife. Breakfast was over at 9am, and was below average, without any fresh fruit."
Quality Inn,"The staff is great, very helpful! The bed was rock hard though."
Quality Inn,For the price go stay somewhere nicer! Looks alot better in the photos! Its old and out dated!
Quality Inn,"There are too many items to list. The staff was awful, hateful and RUDE! The bed appeared to already have been slept in and unmade and the staff didn't even care when brought to their attention."
Quality Inn,Decent place. Didn't clean room and refill coffee after first day.
Quality Inn,Decent place. Didn't clean room and refill coffee after first day.
Quality Inn,Rooms where clean but the air was off in the room so it was about 90
Quality Inn,Not worth the money or hassle! Not only is this hotel not clean but the service is very bad. the women that ownes the hotel is very quick to judge when she needs to take a few english classes to understand what her clients really want. And watch out because if they don't like the review that you left they will remove it from city search like they did my first one.

Quality Inn,to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
Dockers Inn,"Room was nice and clean and bed was very comfortable. On the downside, the volume didn't work on TV and it was too late when we got back to the room to call for assistance. The bathroom door would hang up on commode when opening or closing and you had to really shove it to clear the commode. We don't expect a great breakfast but it did not meet our expectations."
Dockers Inn,"Went for a relaxing weekend. We've stayed many times at Dockers. Inexpensive, clean, and comfortable"
Dockers Inn,"Great room for the value. Only downside was the bed didn't have any blankets, and the place didn't have an elevator. Other than that the room was clean with a little fridge and a nice breakfast."
Dockers Inn,The front desk clerk was very friendly at check-in and made suggestions of things to do while we were in towns. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and spoke to each guest as if she was welcoming us into her home.
Dockers Inn,We had a great stay.
Dockers Inn,"Overall, a great stay. Clean room, clean pool, quick check in. Only negative was ac in room only cooled the side of the room closest to the unit. The other half of the room was quite warm."

Dockers Inn,it was okay
Dockers Inn,"comfy pillows, great breakfast and hospitality, water was luke warm and wifi went out a few times. I think it was because it was a holiday weekend and they were booked. I'd go back."
Dockers Inn,"This hotel is not too far off 76 and has a nice outdoor pool that appears to be well maintained. They have a complimentary breakfast with sausage, biscuits, gravy, toast, cereals, bagels, etc. The lady attending it was not especially friendly and seemed irritated with the guests. the room was decent. The toilet and shower room is very small and separate from the sink/vanity. The beds were comfortable enough."
Dockers Inn,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean, nicely decorated, and the air was very cold."
Dockers Inn,Very nice hotel. Great staff very friendly. Great breakfast. And close to lots of shopping. Will definitely stay here again!
Dockers Inn,Staff very courteous and friendly. Free breakfast. Beautiful rooms.
Dockers Inn,Everything went super---quick check-in and check out. Unit just as expected!!
Dockers Inn,"For the price, things were pretty good. We would stay again IF they would do something with their water pressure and shower heads. They are the worse I have ever seen. There were several stands in the room that looked like they had not been dusted in months. The breakfast was very good with a nice selection. Check in and staff at front desk were very nice. Overall, it was good until we had to shower."
Dockers Inn,"The toilet was gross. Bowl had been scrubbed but who knows the last time the bottom and around the toilet had been cleaned. Sheets had stains on them and the bed skirt was ripped badly and looked terrible. All the furniture just looked tossed in there just because it fit and there was a safe in the room but said, do not use so that seems pointless. There was only a TINY bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't enough enough to use for just Myself let alone 4 people. You could tell the room never seems to get a good clean. Just the standard bed change and replenish or towels and few condiments.The customer desk answered a personal phone call on her cell when she was signing us in. I would never stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night!"
Dockers Inn,Great will come back
Dockers Inn,Dairy Queen Hotel. Comfortable beds. Service was wonderful. Would definitely stay here again if we are in Branson.

Dockers Inn,The room was clean but did not have a phone.It was worth the money.
Dockers Inn,Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Hotel is near the strip and has a mini golf course and resturant near by that can be accesses without the crazy strip traffic
Dockers Inn,"In town for a conference, got to room at 10 pm, traffic on the main hiway is awful at that time. This hotel is on the SW side of town. Air conditioner worked well, sheets were clean, coffee and biscuits and gravy were very hot in the am. We left room at 8am. Older hotel, but ok. No smoking a plus."
Dockers Inn,"Clean, safe, hotel for a very reasonable price. Not fancy but comfortable and close to the strip. Free breakfast was a nice touch. Breakfast was assorted cereals, toast, bagels, donuts, sausage, biscuits smd gravy, assorted juices coffee."
Dockers Inn,Gave a 4 on condition because in bathroom cracked tile was sharp if not careful could hurt your foot had to make sure family watched out for it..

Dockers Inn,The room lighting was very dim

Dockers Inn,Staff were friendly and accommodating nice breakfast every morning (included with hotel stay) well constructed quite rooms carpets were dirty/grimy in the room we had I'd stay again but try and get a room with newer carpet and pool side. Cleaning crew was good (carpets not their fault.
Dockers Inn,"had a very nice, relaxing 2 day get away. Enjoyed Silver Dollar City and shopping in Branson MO."
Dockers Inn,Hotel was great. The only thing that could be changed are the bathrooms. They are a little smaller than most. Hotel is located in a great location.
Dockers Inn,Hotel room was a little dated but beds where good and room was clean. Free breakfast was ok but it was same thing for 4 days. Staff was nice and very helpfull. I Would stay here again.
Dockers Inn,"Room was comfortable, but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced. Rest of room was very clean."
Dockers Inn,"This is by far one of the cleanest hotels in Branson. Great breakfast, comfortable beds, friendly staff and all at a very good price."
Dockers Inn,The best free hot and cold breakfast I've had so far. It was nice that breakfast time was open till 10am. Was able to sleep in a little bit and still be able to enjoy breakfast before hitting the famous Branson strip. Had some very minor issues but management handled it in a very accommodating manner so no need to make a mad review. All in all I can't wait to go back and will definitely see if Dockers Inn has any vacancies.
Dockers Inn,"We looked for a cheap hotel (around 50 a night) with a pool and deluxe breakfast for an end of dummer quick getaway. This was a good choice Expedia. Came down later than we planned due to traffic on the hwy. I called Craig at the desk and let him know- and he was so friendly and Waited for us before locking the lobby door. The room was large, CLEAN,and comfortable. Updated with flat screen microwave AND a refrigerator / freezer combo. Perfect! Breakfast was cereal, French toast, biscuits and gravy, sausage or bagels but no eggs. There was plenty of food and space to eat. The pool is outdoors and had plenty of chairs - open 9 to 11 pm. The water was cool on 100' day but the filter needed to be run -water was a little cloudy. The air conditioner blew cold and stayed cold the whole stay even though it was 100 every day. Overall a great stay ! I would recommend It and stay again on our next trip down in the fall! I only gave facilities an average grade because of the pool. The lobby, parking lot, and common areas were clean and trash free."
Dockers Inn,Wonderful experience. Will stay again
Dockers Inn,Found it overall very enjoyable
Dockers Inn,Our toilet stopped working in the middle of the night. Things not kept up. Breakfast was good.
Dockers Inn,"Absolutely awful... The in-room phones did not work, no wifi access. But thats not the bad unfortunately. All electricity went out at probably 2am. Floors were so gross, I never took my shoes off, air conditioner unit sounded like a wounded animal. Killed two spiders, and a roach. The office was closed, and I just left, to find other accommodations."
Dockers Inn,"This is a great hotel for a basic comfortable stay in Branson. Room was clean, beds were comfortable and breakfast was good with a huge variety. We will stay here again!"
Dockers Inn,The room was very clean and comfortable. Good location to get around town.
Dockers Inn,"Good location at a great rate with nice folks, comfortable bed and SUPER clean"
Dockers Inn,Amazing
Dockers Inn,"The front desk staff was great and friendly during check-in time and check-out. We stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay. I am not a smoker and this time the outside walkways and parking lot smelled like a smoke pit. The walkways had numerous bucket ashtrays and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around. I do not want to smell nasty cigarette smoke that may cause adverse health problems for me, my wife and toddler. I would suggest having designated smoke areas away from the hotel. I was not impressed with our stay this time round, we only were staying here for one night after our weekly resort stay. The breakfast was good with a variety of foods for all to eat. The breakfast hours were great, 7-10."
Dockers Inn,Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Very clean and comfortable room!
Dockers Inn,"We were promised two room next to each other and we were told yes three times. We were promised rooms on the first floor so my mother-in-law wouldn't have to climb steps. Instead we were given rooms on the second floor which was at ground level, but breakfast was served on the first floor. When we questioned the reservation all we were told was that we tried to accommodate you but couldn't. This was after we were promised three times that we would get rooms next to each other and on the first floor."
Dockers Inn,"Dirty towels on the back of the bathroom door, otherwise the room was clean. No remote for television. Lady at check-in was rude when I wanted to pay cash instead of charging to the card that I had used to reserve the room. Breakfast: Terrible coffee. Unless you are an oatmeal person, the only real protein was sausage. No eggs or yogurt. Soggy french toast. Other choices were biscuits, plain gravy, dry cereal (milk), juice, apples, toast, cake donuts, bagels. CARB overload."
Dockers Inn,Great breakfast--french toast! Good price.
Dockers Inn,Great room great breakfast. We will stay again!
Dockers Inn,Our stay was nice. The room was nice and very clean. The staff was very courteous and friendly. Breakfast was very good. We would stay here again.
Dockers Inn,Not very good! Manybetter choices in the area!
Dockers Inn,The hotel pictures did not adequately show current conditions of motel. Was disappointed compared to what was shown online.
Dockers Inn,We had no hot water and breakfast ran out of of a lot of foods an hour early.
Dockers Inn,"Bedroom and bathroom cleanliness was subpar, but the breakfast service was great. Overall, a case of getting what you paid for."
Dockers Inn,Great room. Clean and very comfortable. Great breakfast
Dockers Inn,Friendly workers and nice warm breakfast
Dockers Inn,Breakfast attendant was great! Very friendly and kept everything stocked.
Dockers Inn,"Very nice hotel. Comfy beds. Room had a decent size fridge, microwave,coffee pot with plenty of coffee, nice 6 ft swimming pool. Easy check in/ out. Breakfast was good. French toast, donuts, bg, cereal,etc."
Dockers Inn,Staff was very friendly and breakfast was good. Pool area looked nice and clean. We would stay there again.
Dockers Inn,The very nice and helpful. The lady who did the breakfast room was very nice and friendly. Nice clean room for a reasonable price.
Dockers Inn,Good room at good price
Dockers Inn,"All of our needs were met. Friendly, quiet, modestly priced."
Dockers Inn,"It was a very nice stay for a great price. They went out of their way to be helpful from calling to confirm what time we would be there (to have the room ready) to answering questions about shows, etc. The room was very spacious and had a great full-size microwave and larger apartment-sized fridge. The beds were VERY comfortable. I usually have a hard time sleeping in hotel beds but not this one (firm, but not too firm)! There were some minor cosmetic issues but overall well-kept and clean. Only complaint I could give: there were no eggs with breakfast (important for those with dietary restrictions)"
Dockers Inn,"was very comfortable, convenient, and clean. Personal very very helpful and friendly."
Dockers Inn,"Great,friendly staff. Room was clean and quiet. What more could you ask for"
Dockers Inn,We stayed in this hotel by chance. We had booked another room at Lodge at the Falls and when we arrived we was told we had been rebooked at Dockers due to the original hotel flooding! Well lucky us! This place is clean. The staff is nice and for 69 a night you can't beat it. Fixing to go try... More
Dockers Inn,"Dockers is one of my top two in Branson for consistency. Beds are comfy, staff is friendly and breakfast is beyond adequate with a good variety. The room was less clean than it has been in the past and hotel was in a bit rougher shape. But also know this is nearing the end of tourist season so not surprised. Love the fact it is off the main drag enough that it is quiet."
Dockers Inn,"We enjoyed Dockers Inn, the staff was friendly the breakfast was tasty. Most importantly, the rooms were clean. We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. The hotel is close enough to the strip to walk, but far enough that you don't have all the busy traffic in front. The beds were very comfortable. It is nothing fancy, but to me cleanliness and comfort are on the top of the list. Great price also."
Dockers Inn,"A pleasant surprise beginning with a great check in experience. Older but well maintained and very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. A comfortable, convenient place to stay at a good price."
Dockers Inn,Very relaxing and a Wonderful staff.
Dockers Inn,"It was a 2-day stay for weekend. The room wasn't anything special, but the beds were clean and nice. The bathroom was very small but clean. The AC was cold but noisy and difficult to adjust temp."
Dockers Inn,"The room was good, staff was nice. Check in and out was quick. The carpet was filthy, when I walked barefoot my feet got dirty. The bed was comfy. I was woke up in the morning by sirens going by. Close to the strip, you can walk to a lot of places."
Dockers Inn,"Hotel is a little worn and dated but clean and comfortable. Slightly overpriced in my opinion , but we stayed last minute on a summer weekend. Beds were comfy and had a larger than normal fridge !"
Dockers Inn,"The water wasn't hot,the refrigerator was noisy. The water was difficult to turn off."
Dockers Inn,Bed was comfy. TV was flat screen with lots of channels. No waffles anymore but OK with me. Good stay for the price. Room was attended to every day.
Dockers Inn,Was really great other than cheap rooms are forced on the 3rd floor.
Dockers Inn,Nice place for a short stay. Nothing fancy. This was the second time we stayed here for a weekend on the lake. The rooms are beginning to look a little run down but are clean. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The price is reasonable. It's close to everything.
Dockers Inn,"quite, clean, friendly and easily excessable"
Dockers Inn,"VERY clean room. Outside door parking very close to room. Good Breakfast with Sausage, Gravy, Pastries, and Fruit. Very clean and well-maintained pool. The manager was so kind and quickly checked us in. He even gave me show recommendations. Really great price in a really great location."
Dockers Inn,"Very nice staff, breakfast was great and great location. Would definitely recommend Dockers Inn."
Dockers Inn,Our safe was very nice
Dockers Inn,"Free breakfast was not as good as it could have been. But over all everything was great, staff were all very pleasant."
Dockers Inn,Very nice and comfortable room. Friendly staff.
Dockers Inn,"We decided to go to Branson on the spur of moment. On the drive there my wife jumped on groupn to find this place for 66.00 a night. They were friendly upon arriving and got a clean comfortable room. The breakfast was French toast, sausage, and biscuit and gravy. Had donuts and bagels. Cold cereals and juices. Close to everything... More"
Dockers Inn,"This was our first trip to Branson. The hotel is old. Carpet was frayed, chair was saggy, room was damp and musty. Breakfast was gross and not much to pick from. The room was clean, so that was a plus. Would not stay here again, as there seemed to be plenty other places to pick from for the same or better pricing. The location was good, as we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants."
Dockers Inn,This was our second stay at Dockers Inn. We believe this to be a great place for the price. It is very clean and the beds are great. The breakfast in the morning is good also. It is very close to everything we wanted to see. The front desk people both evening and morning were very friendly. We will definitely... More
Dockers Inn,very small fee per pet which is totally worth it if you've got your 4 legged furry family member with you.
Dockers Inn,Everything from check in to check out went smooth. The location was very good for the shows we had picked. The hot breakfast was a welcome change from a continental breakfast of rolls or doughnuts and coffee.
Dockers Inn,Good hotel. Bathrooms need updating. Very clean.
Dockers Inn,Comfortable bed and a decent nights sleep. All for a good price.
Dockers Inn,"the stay was very comfortable., employees where very helpful in getting tickets to the shows which was very good seats. breakfast was good. Rooms where clean."
Dockers Inn,"horrible attitudes. not very good. the food was okay, but not good enough to where i'd go back. i don't recommend this place."
Dockers Inn,"Clean,quite and attractive room, good location on alternate route: nice breakfast"
Dockers Inn,"Last minute reservation, clean, friendly."
Dockers Inn,Not a clean room. sheets had stains and bathroom was smelly. Breakfast was terrible. But it was very cheap
Dockers Inn,"very comfortable beds, close to walking distance of shows and shopping"
Dockers Inn,"Not bad. wall paper peeling off wall, but clean, with comfortable beds."
Dockers Inn,We attended a wonderful seniors conference of music and preaching. Did some shopping in between events. Always enjoy Branson. Attended a show one evening.
Dockers Inn,Staff was very friendly and very helpful
Dockers Inn,Very pleased
Dockers Inn,Comfortable and quiet Easy in and out to avoid traffic on 76
Dockers Inn,Stayed one night with my grandkids. Wish I could have stayed longer.
Dockers Inn,This is our fourth stay at the Dockers Inn and we were very satisfied with our stay. It is close to all the shopping but in a quieter setting than on the main street. Our room was clean and roomy. The staff is friendly and the property is very well maintained. We enjoyed our stay and will be returning next year. I would very much recommend this hotel.
Dockers Inn,I have spent many nights in Branson and this has the best bed that I have ever slept on.
Dockers Inn,"Great stay, close to Branson strip, clean rooms friendly staff and clerk. Great breakfast. Will stay again next time in Branson!"
Dockers Inn,"As me and my friends fou d this place we thought it would be nice until we were wrong, the rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason. There were ants crawling in the breakfast room and the ice machines and even the pop machine took my 1 dollar since i got it back by the manager.... More"
Dockers Inn,it was excwellent wouid go back
Dockers Inn,not very good! manybetter choices in the area!
Dockers Inn,"I have stayed here several times. Good bedding, powerful shower, had a new flat screen with good cable, breakfast with several choices. This is a great deal and a very clean place. Central location, just far enough off the strip. Had a microwave and nice sized refrigerator with a freezer. This is a very large room."
Dockers Inn,It was great. Stayed here before...will stay here again!
Dockers Inn,Perfect for a one night stay to go daughter play volleyball.
Dockers Inn,Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very neat and clean. Close to everything!!!! Breakfast was yum and not just continental. Definitely will make reservations at Dockers Inn again.
Dockers Inn,"Horrible attitudes. Not very good. The food was okay, but not good enough to where I'd go back. I don't recommend this place."
Dockers Inn,Loved this hotel perfect the paring was great staff was amazing... loved it
Dockers Inn,The beds are the best. The staff are so nice and helpfull. i would stay here again in a heartbeat. we stayed on the 2nd. floor easy to get to. The pool was fun to swim in and the swimming towels are very soft.
Dockers Inn,The lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful it was a great price for the stay. The breakfast was good Overall good night stay
Dockers Inn,great stay breakfast not as good as advertised
Dockers Inn,"Our visit would have been great if we hadn't woken up to cold showers. We came back from breakfast and had no hot water. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was just ok for us. Great location. Beds were comfortable. A/C kept it very comfortable with it very hot outside."
Dockers Inn,"Very Good. Room was clean, beds comfortable, breakfast better than average. Pool open late April. Allows pets, but stay on second floor which is easily accessible from parking lot, no stairs. Did have a squabble over room price. Receptionist wanted more than cost of room on Internet. She settled for Internet price."
Dockers Inn,Easily accessible. Great value. Friendly staff.
Dockers Inn,"We initially booked this hotel for one night of a two night stay in Branson. Upon seeing how clean the room was and meeting the friendly staff, we went back to the front desk and booked our second night here. The room was clean. Our 3rd floor room had a refrigerator and coffee maker. No microwave. Bed was comfortable. A/C worked great. Plenty of hot water (caution: very hot water) for the shower. Room did not have a phone, but that was not an issue for us. Breakfast was good included biscuits and gravy, french toast, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, and fruit, very good coffee and juice. Only thing missing that would have made it better would have been scrambled eggs. Staff was very friendly and helpful recommending shows to go see."
Dockers Inn,The Staff at Dockers were incredibly kind and eager to serve. The rooms were comfortable and the free breakfast had lots of food options to choose from. I was satisfied considering the low cost of this room.
Dockers Inn,Staff was very nice and friendly. Nice pool great location. Needs some updating. But overall a good experience.
Dockers Inn,It was a very nice motel. There was a good restaurant right next door that has a buffet and a couple that sings while you eat. The room at the hotel was very comfortable with good amneties.
Dockers Inn,Have stayed before enjoyed it then and this time the staff was very nice and helpful! Will stay there again grandkids loved it too!
Dockers Inn,We only paid 50 a night for this motel and it was definitely a great deal for that price.
Dockers Inn,"I have stayed here multiple times and have always had a great experience. The room is always immaculate, and I appreciate the refrigerator and microwave in each room. The pool is nice and clean and has a seating area for those who watch. The hotel is located off the main road but easy to find. The breakfast is good."
Dockers Inn,"This was my family's second time staying here. This hotel is very clean. Easy access to restaurants, grocery stores, and activities. They were doing some updates to the hotel while we were there but they were never disruptive. And the air conditioner works great!. We will be back!"
Dockers Inn,The service people were friendly and accomidating
Dockers Inn,"We were pleasantly surprised at the value of this motel! Perfect quiet location that was one block from the main drag! Rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable and breakfast was really good! Carpets could use an update but for the price, this place can't be beat!"
Dockers Inn,The check in was extremely fast. This is a simple but good enough hotel. Breakfast was very good. This is an affordable hotel in a very good location.
Dockers Inn,Medium hotel. It was a non-smoking room but it wreaked of smoke the minute I opened the door. There are chairs and a smoking pot next to each door. Not attractive. No elevator. The ice machine on the 2nd floor didn't work. I had to take the stairs to the ground floor to the working ice machine. The free breakfast was pretty good.
Dockers Inn,Great price. Great location. Staff great... Highly recommend
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,One night stay. The room was very clean. Staff friendly. Pool and hot tub very nice. Only had two issues. TV picture was horrible. Not HD. Not a big deal for one night. Asked for extra 30 minutes to check out and was told they don't do late check out. First time I've ever been denied. Overall though a nice place
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Air conditioner noisy.. keeps going on/off. Inturrupted sleep. These units should be outside the room.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Had a wonderful stay here. The staff, from the front desk to the cleaning people they are all amazing and very friendly. The only issue we had was the drains in the bathroom were slow to go down, other than that this hotel is great! Pool Spa are awesome!"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We barely had any channels on the television
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Will not be staying again and it is a shame because we have stayed there many times. Makes me sad because it is so convenient to the airport. Looking for a new place for the next time
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Hotel itself was okay but the free breakfast was hardly worth mentioning. One poor woman trying to keep up with dozens of people eating Sunday breakfast meant that they were constantly out of EVERYTHING. Ended up having to wait 15 minutes for coffee. The buffet ran out of juice, coffee, bread products, eggs, flatware, plates. Very sad."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Room light when you enter door isn't working, there were tiny bugs crawling on floor next to bath tub. Receptionist who checked us in also mentioned that she won't put credit card on hold if I hand in 100 in cash, but I preferred not to because I never heard of such thing."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Hotels.com took minutes to set up a great room and saved some . Thanks.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I booked this hotel about three weeks in advance and could tell that hotel rooms in GR were scarce and expensive that night, so our rate for this room was 159. This was probably the worst room I've ever paid that kind of money for. The bed was very comfortable, but that's all I can say that's positive. The hotel, room and the bathroom are run down and need updating. The hallways and stairwells smell strongly of smoke. There was a big empty space in our room where I imagine a chair/ottoman or recliner should have been and wasn't. The room had a mini fridge but no drinking glasses of any kind. Luckily we did not spend much time here, but it made the price we paid even a worse value than it already was."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The motel was very clean and the people working there were amazing
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Overnight for an early flight and park a week.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Decent hotel, not exceptional and not terrible either. Our expectations were met. Right off I-96, easy to get to and a Meijer grocery store across the street. It was the guests that were obnoxious - hockey parents and kids. Loud and rude, propped the outside back door open all night for both nights we stayed, monopolized all common areas, left trash in halls, didn't watch kids in the hot tub, entitled behavior galore."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This hotel was in a great location. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Shower curtain is a little short. Breakfast has good food and if you get there early enough, there isn't many people around. Breakfast was spacious and clean. Staff was friendly."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Just needed a place for the night. It was clean and comfortable. The TV itself was a nice new model, but the cable was fuzzy and standard definition. I know this was probably an isolated situation, but the people in the room next to me were loudly fighting with and screaming at one another at midnight. Someone else then was singing and whistling at 6:00 A.M. Odd."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The hotel staff and there follow through with polices were horrible. There was a group at the hotel the weekend we stayed. The smell of weed was covered through the hotel. The staff told us there was nothing they could do because they don't know if they had a medical card or not to smoke weed however we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes. My daughter was racially harassed by another guest. All the hotel did was give us an extra hour to checkout. The pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep. The pool had tons of ppl under the age of 18 acting like fools most of the time. Will NOT return to this hotel.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Convenient location. Affordable price. Stayed before leaving on vacation by plane. Was allowed to leave my car free of charge while gone. Shuttle service to and from the airport was prompt and courteous. Breakfast was available. Pool and hot tub were clean and enjoyable. Staff was extremely helpful and made sure our stay was great. Rooms were being renovated and updated. Only downside was the elevator was out of order but was being fixed the next day.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Overall, it was a fine stay, but the hotel is a little run down and the room was kind of gross. The staff was nice and the breakfast was good. Location was nice, next to the freeway, but the road in front was really busy during rush hour, which made the property a little hard to get in and out of."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We frequently stay at this hotel. The staff is wonderful, clean rooms and pool area. You get a 15 percent discount at Branns Restaurant next door when you tell them your stating at the Best Western ! They too have great food and service! If I had to say I could better one thing about our stay it would have to be that the hot tub jets do not bubble the hot tub , they only blow. That is the main purpose and reason many do enjoy a hot tub. Other than that I give this Best western 5 stars! Let me add they have a really good breakfast bar as well free w stay! Always reasonable priced stay!"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Comfortable bed, clean room .. Close to me meeting .. Price was a bit High.. I would stay there more when in town for business if price was alittle lower like 50 a night .. Ray Lenardson...pur business has a weekly meeting there and I would stay there more often if price was lower ..and so would a lot of folks who attend meeting on Tuesday nights / Bonvera / EXTRODA .. Thanks Ray Kenardson"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We just stayed overnight after flying home from overseas. The beds were very comfortable gave us a great nights rest before having to drive home the next day.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I stayed one night. For the price, you can't beat it. The free breakfast was awesome."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Best Western Hospitality Hotel Suites on 28th Street in GR was a very nice hotel. We had a good stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is nice and clean and breakfast was good. My only small complaint would be that while the bedding is very soft and nice, the bed is very hard."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 other times before this one and hands down have rated it each time as excellent and above average, however, my wife and I had a horrible experience with the breakfast staff just taking away items not letting us know it was time to shut down or asking if we wanted anything, also our... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Filthy room, drunk adults and teenagers wandering the hallways, paper thin walls. We were relocating for my work and had a four night reservation. Cancelled it an hour after arrival and spent a miserable night"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Was very pleased with hotel and the area. Would for sure stay there again.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"The room needed some maintenance, however, the overall stay was good."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We got a big room, and bed was comfortable. Easy access to services around. Good location. There was a mild displeasing odor, probably due to manifest problems with the toilet flushing. Fixable issue, so should not be a worry for other travellers."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Room was not secure. Windows were not locked and were open to the balcony. I went to the front desk and they gave me a new room. Again the Windows were unlocked and open to the balcony. I left the hotel and did not stay.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We usually stay here when we come to Grand Rapids.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I always stay at this hotel while in Grand Rapids due to location, quality price. I often receive the multi-night discount due to the length of my stay. Rooms are very good for the age of the property. Although the breakfast eggs are somewhat rubbery, the sausage gravy is the best I've had in a hotel."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Just an overnight for 6 am flight. Pleasantly surprised with room and pool. Some remodel occurring and check in was very slow. Otherwise a good stay
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We were only in town overnight for an early flight. We were able to check in a bit early and return our rental car using the hotel shuttle. The room was clean and spacious, plenty of room for a family of 4. The only complaint on cleanliness would be that the shower was clogged. There were a few restaurants within walking distance serving good local beers, and the kids enjoyed the pool. The shuttle got us to the airport super early for our flight, which was appreciated. We felt this hotel paid attention to detail and actually tried to earn our business, as there are a few choices in the area for airport access."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We stayed the weekend to get away from the kids in a jacuzzi room and had a great relaxing time. The room was very clean and comfortable. There was a full house when we stayed and still had no problems or concerns. Breakfast was pretty good I just wish there was more seating space to eat as we had to... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"good service, good value but needs some maintenance attention."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Clean rooms, but the lobby and stairs needed vacuuming, Ask for a room in the front hallway, rooms in back were noisy at night, perhaps construction noise. Nice breakfast. Nice pool. Perhaps a little pricier than I was looking for"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,I like it alot
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,I was not happy with Hotels.com. My first or two night reservation was not with the hotel properly and I had to pay a higher rate than what I booked with Hotels.com. The 2nd night reservation was correct but not the first.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,excessive noise.... my room was next to interstate
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Very relaxing and clean. Love the staff
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Love the complimentary food/drinks throughout the day. Hotel is clean and comfortable, staff was very friendly and accomodating! We stay here each time we are in Grand Rapids. You cannot beat the price for all the amenities!"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Pretty average stay. Clean room, quiet. Pool and hottub looked nice. Decent breakfast. Would I stay here again Yes."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"very accessible from the expressway, with in walking distance to Meijer and other stores, if you had to walk. The shuttle will take you anywhere you ask if you don't have transportation. We where very satisfied with our stay, everyone was very pleasant. We would stay again"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Staff was very accommodating. Have a free dinner that goes until 7 pm.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Reserved this room 1 week ahead of visit. Handicapped room only available without tub.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,My only complaint was the channel selection on the TV. It was horrible.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,i had a not so pleasant experience the room wasn't the cleanest and staff wasn't the nicest. I wouldn't book this room ever again. Nor would I refer a friend. I kept getting knocks on my door hours before checkout even with the do not disturb tag on my door.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"we were in town for a nephew's wedding. It was cozy, clean and friendly service."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Their breakfast is terrible........waffle machine was broken, they brought out the cereal dispensers after we were gone and there was no display unit for the muffins and Danishes (no cover either)."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"While this hotel is not downtown, it is only a short drive to view ArtPrize in Grand Rapids. There is where I stay when visiting Grand Rapids. My adult daughter and I enjoyed the hot tub the evening of our arrival. We had a pleasant stay."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Shower was small and bed was hard but room was clean and big breakfast was good
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Delightful
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Great venue for our reception. It was not too expensive, it looked formal, and the food was great."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This is a great place to stay in Grand Rapids. The price was wonderful, the room was clean and it was perhaps one of the best stays in Grand Rapids! It's close to a lot of nice restaurants, etc. Accessibility to this place is quite easy!"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Front desk staff needs to work on their customer service hallway was so heavy with bleach the first day, that my throat was burning my room had knats that just wouldn't go away furniture and beds are dated walls are thin, you can hear everyone and their tv's in other rooms never attempted breakfast, decided to buy outside. I only stayed here b/c it was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Over all the hotel was clean and friendly the pool looked nice and was clean the staff for most part was friendly and caring the breakfast was free and the exterior was clean the area was a busy area so next door was a restaurant that was easy to walk to , if you wanted to exercise you could go...

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Well, no towels at the pool. No towels in the room. Wifi was down was half of our stay. The staff was responsive when alerted to the problems, but they were strange problems to experience at a hotel."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We stayed at Best Western mainly for the price and location. We thought the room was ok. It was clean and I do have to say that the bed was pretty comfortable. We were there on a holiday weekend so the free continental breakfast area was jammed. We ended up going out to breakfast one of the days. Not a... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Front desk personnel were pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was good and varied. Hash browns would have been a nice addendum to the menu. The free dinner was actually good. I had read about it on the website but wasn't quite sure what to expect. The motel was quiet and conveniently located for easy access to the airport. The bathroom was clean, the room carpet worn but that's typical at most motels anyway. I would stay there again because of the location, personnel and provided food."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Our room was not cleaned and the maid actually blew my daughter off. This was 3 moms and I had paid for this weekend for them to get a break...didn't offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Nice place for a quick visit.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Bed was really comfy. The shower had 2 shower heads, one at normal height and one at waist height. I'm not really sure what the purpose of the lower one was, but it felt really nice to have 2 showerheads spraying on me. The only complaint I had was that the TV picture was terrible. Why provide a nice flat screen TV if you aren't going to have HD cable"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Bright flood lights outside at night. No curtains inside to block light at night. Had to rig a curtain out of bed sheet.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The heat didn't work in the room and we were over charged twice and still haven't got the money back would stay again if it was my last resort ....
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Kelsey at the front desk was very helpful! When I went to check in at the hotel, I was told that i couldn't because I was not 21... Disappointing it was yes, however i was able to get a full refund. At that point Kelsey called local hotels that had a minimum check in age of 18. In which she... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The hotel had nice beds and the Rooms were clean. Would recommend to anyone needing a good place to stay near the airport. Safe Area. Has a nice center area with basketball court and seating areas if you have an extended stay. Traveled for Business. Would stay again.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"their breakfast is terrible........waffle machine was broken, they brought out the cereal dispensers after we were gone and there was no display unit for the muffins and danishes (no cover either)."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Overall the hotel was clean and breakfast was good but having three very large flies in the room that I had to take care of because the window would not close completely kind of put a crimp in the overall experience.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Don't even know where to start. It is very noisy in the room, any time the neighbors close the door you jump on your bad. The non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette. After the front desk person was nice enough to give me another room, I've realized that none of the rooms have ny noise reduction and...

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,I had a problem with the refridgerator was not plugged in and made the room smell bad and when i called the front desk they had the maintenance man fix it but it stunk the whole stay.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"The room was very clean, the beds very comfortable with plenty of pillows. The internet worked well. The breakfast was quite good. Only one complaint....the television got very few stations (Dish Network) and a number of the channels that it did receive were quite fuzzy and unwatchable."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Very clean. Located by everything u might need. Pizza and Bran's next door, Meijer across the street, and right off the highway. The pool is huge and deep. The hot tub can hold 8 adults comfortable. Hotel is only mins from the airport. The down side, its a nice drive 2 downtown and the local night life if your looking... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Staff was courteous and always smiling and helpful. Breakfast was good but could have been warmer. Room was clean and so were the hallways. We will be back
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"no to satisfied with the website policy, I found out that special price was given to customer visiting the ArtPrize and of course I didnt get it, that was the reason for my visit... and also no AAA discount was given even do they have it advertising in the front desk. I reported the toilet not working properly and was never fixed. the shower head was broke and was been hold by a plastic bag. The halls smelled like smoke."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Nice room but beds too high. It was hard to get on and off. Bathroom needed serious updating. The grout was crumbling and everything in that bathroom was old. The room had a nice big refrigerator which was nice. The room was a bit damp and the air conditioner was loud but it was needed. The staff was nice and... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Good location for visits to Grand Rapids. Had a meal at the Hopcat downtown which was well worth a visit. Visited during a road trip so we're surprised to find that there was an Art show throughout the city which was a great bonus. We managed to visit the Gerald Ford museum for free as a result of this. Hotel... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Things weren't plugged in when we got there we thought it was something else and had to call maintenance. Beds weren't comfy, room and hotel looked old and bathroom had a handicap toilet and was small and calked everywhere the air conditioner turned on a lot aND was very loud. The pool was great and my kids liked it however the chlorine in it was bad their eyes burned and we're red. The people were nice though and it was right across the road from miejers."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Bed was very comfortable, heating/ac unit exceptionally quiet. This motel was a very satisfactory place to stay on 28th St. in Grand Rapids. Good hot breakfast. Breakfast area somewhat cramped--try to eat when not too busy. Coffee and tea in lobby nice touch."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We traveled down to Grand Rapids for some local attractions, and we were looking for a place to stay. Hot Wire offered an excellent deal on this hotel. The hotel was fantastic. Our king suite was comfortable for myself and two children, the pool is clear and huge, there is a complimentary dinner, and breakfast was great. It was a... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"worse stay in a hotel i ever had. pool and hot tub out of order. housekeeping never changed bed linens, vacuumed, swept or cleaned. noise all hours of the night after we had traveled 12 hours for my brother's funeral. front desk offered to shuttle us to another hotel to use pool and hot tub. really weather was snow and ice. wasn't about to go out in our swimwear in freezing weather."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Arrived late, left early"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Left clothes in the room, called same day to report. Staff couldn't find them but said they would check with housekeeping and call me back. Woke me up at 2:30 AM that night (!) to report that they couldn't find them. Seriously! Room wasn't particularly clean, food on TV remote. Door hardware wasn't functioning properly, and the deadbolt wouldn't fully... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Room was very nice , clean and modern. Bed wasn't the most comfortable , but far from the most uncomfortable weve ever stayed in. We had alot of water pipe noise in the early morning, loud enough to wake us from a dead sleep. Breakfast was great, but make sure you pay attention to what time it starts because if... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"The carpets need to be cleaned especially down the hall there was visible staining all over. The beds were a nightmare, compareable to a cheap mattress from a discount store.That being said, the hotel is easy to find and if you forgot something near shopping and restaurants. Rose the assistant manager went above and beyond calling around trying to find a pizza place for us that would deliver."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"With the addition of a 15 discount at Brann's Steakhouse next door, this hotel offers everything you could desire from an affordable hotel. Free airport shuttle, free hot breakfast, free dinner Monday through Thursday, a hot tub and pool, and fast and friendly service. The rooms are always clean and each have a mini fridge and microwave. The fitness center... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Bathroom was dingy with water leaks in ceiling and around trim, room just seemed dingy and in need of MAJOR remodeling. 4 persons were in room but only two towels, very loud air conditioning unit, hallway to room needed swept and had a strange musty smell. Ran out of breakfast foods in the morning. Best Western needs to update this hotel desperatelyand would never stay at another Best Western chain because of this."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Overall a good comfortable stay in a safe area. Nice pool and hot tub!!
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"My husband and I had a wonderful evening at the Best Western in Grand Rapids, Mi. We booked the room for after a concert and it was awesome to have a hot tub right in our room to relax in. First time at a hotel that I actually wanted to take the pillow home with me!"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Staff was loud, 2-way radios, street noise and every shower or flush could be heard from other rooms. We never received an e-mail confirmation for our room so had to call 3 times to confirm. It was a no-smoking room but the odor was significant."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I've stayed at this hotel many times and the staff is always friendly and rooms clean. The pool and hot tub are great after a long day or drive up to Michigan. Breakfast is a little bland but filling non the less. Just generic egg omelets, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and waffles. The hotel is right off the highway so... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Loved the way the bed was so comfortable and soft. The elevator smelled fabulous and the entire establishment seemed to radiate cleanliness and fresh accommodating vibe throughout. The fridge worked very well and had abundant towels and soaps. The heat lights in the bathroom were a nice touch as well. Very friendly staff!
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This hotel is very nice. Everyone was very nice, but we were told that breakfast started at 6, when actually it doesn't start until 7 on weekends. We were unable to eat breakfast at the hotel before we had to leave for the day. Rooms were clean and service was good."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We loved everything about our stay here. The guest room was nicely appointed and very clean. But the best thing about our stay was the incredibly comfortable mattress. We had the best sleep that we've ever had away from home. When traveling in the future, we will try to find a Best Western in the area."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Our overall stay was enjoyable, but I wanted to really extend a thank you to Lisa that prepared breakfast in the morning.. I was VERY busy and she kept right up with keeping everything out for the guests. She was friendly and smiled even through the rush of it all. :-)"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Everything was great except the mattress was really stiff and the shower could use an upgrade
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Don't open the window they'll hammer you with a smoking fee. Went a whole week smoking outside in -10 weather and I open my window to let the shower steam out and wham 150 bucks skip this place
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"There was so many things that went wrong on this trip. Firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel. We booked it for the sauna. it said in advertisement that the sauna was still there, and it is still there but hard to use when it is padlocked shut and it is no longer a usable facility. Second...

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I wanted to give this hotel a high rating because I really liked the pool/hot tub area, the king suite with two bathrooms, and the decent included breakfast. However, we were there for 3 nights and the room was never cleaned. We got back late both nights since we were at an amusement park and settled for clean towels after calling the front desk."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,This was probably one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. When we arrived there was urine in the toilet. When we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing. I called the front desk and no on ever came to the room to take care of the problem. The beds were hard as a rock! The... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Unclean room, low end customer service, discourteous staff, etc. etc. nothing was good about this stay other the the in room Jacuzzi and it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,I called the hotel while we were driving and asked about upgrading our room to a king-suite and having the additional change added to my bill. The woman that assisted me was very nice and upgraded our room without charge. Thank you! We ended up having our 4 and 6 year old grandsons with us for the second night and... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The hotel was older but looked as though it was (or had been) under renewal construction. Was upgraded to a king suite which was nice. Loved that I had a lot of room. Free wifi. Ok breakfast. My room had some issues such as cracks in the walls and didn't seem to be in the best part of town but... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Clean, large room with two queen beds, and refrigerator. Hotel is much larger than I expected when viewing from the front. Large breakfast area with eggs, fruits and cereals. I didn't have time to sample the pool or exercise room."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We were not able to checkin until 7 PM because the rooms had been cleaned even though check-out is at 11 and check-in is at 3. The staff acted like this was no big deal and just expected us to sit and wait. When we got into our room there was old eaten food in the fridge and the room... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The custom service is what makes this hotel a 5 in my book. Every single employee was professional and friendly. Every employee greeted me and smiled. The hotel is a bit dated but most important to me is the customer service and that it is clean and both of these were excellent. The price was not bad neither. I definitely... More
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Stayed with family in two rooms for one night, then returned later in the week for two additional nights. Staff was excellent. Rooms were clean and comfy, and free of road noise despite proximity to highway, but we would really have appreciated some full-size pillows instead of the dinky little pillows provided. Pool was clean and enjoyable but got pretty crowded. WiFi was excellent, much better than in most hotels. Family thought the free breakfast was OK, though I'm not much for eggs and sausage. We would stay here again."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,We stayed here on a road trip. It is located close to the highway exit. I received a large comfortable room on the first floor. Everything was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was excellent with many choices. I would stay here again. The front desk staff was pleasant and friendly.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This is a wonderful hotel: nice location, easy access to and from the airport, and great service. But what made my stay memorable was the way the staffs welcomed and respected me. To add icing on the cake, I was given a free upgrade to a suite."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful considering there were no rooms available at other hotels in the immediate 60 mile radius area.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"Nice place, deep pool, big hot tub, they even cooked hot dogs for guests. Nice! This is close to many things. Even a Meijer is across the street if your forgot anything. We will go back. The price was under 100 you cant beat that."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This property is a nice quit place with clean, nicely furnished rooms. The front desk staff is friendly and was helpful in recommending a place for dinner. It is conveniently located with a restaurant located on adjacent property. Other restaurants, a large sampling of corporate America, are located across the street. The breakfast room was clean and well supplied."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I use to use this place as my cheap stay...it was tolerable,but, not nice. now, they are spending some and improving..and raising rates in step. they need to keep moving the target higher to keep up with these rates..but, give them credit for attempting to improve."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We have stayed here 5 times this year and won't be back. I am a Best Western Platinum member. They did give us a lower rate for the phone and the chair, but I gave up after that. This time I got the lemon room. It started with the phone in the room not working and a broken chair. They...

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The hotel was good for the price. Room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint is that it was very noisy in the hall until late hours probably because my room was located on the way to the pool. Very close to the airport which was helpful as I left on an early morning flight the next morning.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"this hotel has a good, professional, courteous staff. found them all friendly, helpful courteous. all equipment worked in the room it was cleaned well. the heating unit is not loud works well. the pool is nice has a deep end of about 7 ft. adjacent is a hot tub, that will mellow out your aches!...

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This is the motel we prefer when going downstate to visit family and friends in the Grand Rapids area The interstate is right there and a plethora of restaurants surround the location on busy 28th St., not to mention the close proximity to two major malls. Room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Plus the wife was pleased with... More"

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"It all started when the Hotel's hot tub did not work. The wife was looking forward to soaking in some hot water to make her feel better. I went to the front desk to report the problem and the employee Ms. Amanda, exceeded my expectations in taking care of the problem. She offered to up grade our standard room to... More"

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This isn't a new hotel (60's or 70's design), but it is every bit as good a place to stay as a newer property. Staff is very friendly responsive if there is a problem. The price is competitive due to several other hotels in the area."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful. The room was very clean and neat.. Hotel is next to a restaurant which makes the trip more enjoyable. Also the hotel is not far from the airport which makes it very convenient for business.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"We booked two rooms for my daughter's birthday. She wanted to have a hotel camp out with the family and be able to go swimming. Since this place had the largest indoor pool in Grand Rapids, we opted to stay here. Booked two rooms and was double charged for them. The room my girls were in had tiny ants crawling... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,I was so pleased with how well they worked with me and my husband. We are disappointed that they tore it down and relocated to another area. Many people commented on how beautiful it was there.
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"The rooms were Updated and clean, nice staff and the breakfast was good. Overall, this was a very nice place to stay and well positioned between 28th street and I-96. Quick access to anywhere. Having stayed at 9 different hotels in the grand rapids area, this will be my first choice for economical stays."

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"This hotel is rundown and the halls smell like smoke. The bed was comfortable, but there was a huge empty space in the sitting area where a chair should've been. Except for the bed, everything was bare bones basic. I cannot believe we paid 159 for this room, but rooms in GR were scarce that night (we booked a month... More"
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I stay at this hotel several times a year and often request the same room. since my last stay in November, 2015, the room has been repainted and also new carpet, furniture beds. A great place for the business traveler but also many families on the weekends."
Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"I would love to rate this hotel higher, the front desk staff was pleasant, the cleaning staff kind and attentive, the pool clean and fun HOWEVER, every time I looked closer I saw serious signs of poor maintenance. Our door did not work and took multiple attempts to open, the bed frames had huge exposed screws sticking out, the rooms... More"

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,The best part of this hotel is its location. It's right on 28th street where you can find most anything. It's less than 10 minutes from the airport.

Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,"My husband and I were in Grand Rapids for a concert at the DeVos Performance Center.

Wine Valley Lodge,"This place was great for the money, clean, and a good location, but the rooms are small."
Wine Valley Lodge,"considering the over-pricing of all rooms in the valley, this one was acceptable but would be considered pricey for what you get. I would stay here again only because it was economical to do so."
Wine Valley Lodge,Very nice motel in Napa. Enjoyed my stay. Comfy bed. Large TV. Nice pool. Continental breakfast in a.m. was good. Will return again for sure.
Wine Valley Lodge,Room was great! Staff was friendly. Breakfast was truly a treat!
Wine Valley Lodge,A very pleasant place to stay on a weekend at a very reasonable price.
Wine Valley Lodge,2016 Bottlerock!!!! Fun and close to down town...
Wine Valley Lodge,It served the purpose price was affordable compared to other accommodations in area. The window did not lock. I would feel unsafe if I were alone or if it was s girl trip.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Very clean, well run establishment. I highly recommend."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Lovely motel for our overnight trip in Napa. Staff was friendly and very helpful giving us suggestions for places to visit and dine. We ended up driving downtown as it was a hike, but doable esp if it was during the day. Grounds were very clean and parking right in front of room doors. Our room had a king size bed and was very clean as was the bathroom. We could hear the next door neighbors, but it didn't hamper our stay. Breakfast was the normal fare, but had an awesome coffee machine and everything a person could want to start their day. Would def. stay again."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Great hotel, excellent breakfast facilities, pool, quiet, really reasonable rates. Very helpful friendly staff"
Wine Valley Lodge,Very convenient to downtown Napa and wine country tours. Spacious room with large upgraded bathroom. In fact the bathroom was better quality than the San Francisco Hyatt Regency. The breakfast was decent with fresh fruit and a breakfast sandwich in addition to pastries. In this area you could pay twice as much and not get as good quality. Staff is friendly and helpful.
Wine Valley Lodge,"The Wine Valley Lodge is conveniently located off of Hwy 29. The rooms are clean, up-to-date, comfortable and quiet. The staff is friendly and helpful. You'll be happy with the continental breakfast as well."
Wine Valley Lodge,black mold on the shower? spiders in my room? stinky upon entry? all a check!
Wine Valley Lodge,"This place was great. I was there for business and didn't need an extravagant facility. It was clean, the people were friendly and it had a convenient location to downtown Napa. I would definitely stay there again."
Wine Valley Lodge,very kind and friendly
Wine Valley Lodge,"This little lodge worked out perfect for us. It reminded me of a little hacienda. It was neat, clean, quiet and the beds were incredibly comfortable!! The continental breakfast was good too. If you are used to having five star treatment then you probably won't like this place. We were in Napa for the Brian Culbertson Jazz Festival and knew we would not be spending much time at all in whatever hotel we stayed in. All I insisted on was a clean, inexpensive and centrally located place to stay. The Wine Valley Lodge was centrally located between all of the venues we attended. Not a far walk from downtown Napa and very close to all necessities i.e. gas station, market and eateries. The price per night was right up my alley! I would definitely stay there again."
Wine Valley Lodge,Walls are paper thin. The snoring man lady night may as well have been in our room.
Wine Valley Lodge,"I'd stay again if passing through. The facilities were clean, functional and tidy."
Wine Valley Lodge,Had a nice relaxing night!
Wine Valley Lodge,"nice , quiet little old style motel with updates. Nice pool and convenient to everything."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Great home base for wineries. Easy to Uber or walk 1 mile to downtown Napa for restaurants, tasting rooms shops. Hotel is a little beat up, but saved was well spent on fantastic wine. Helpful staff at motel."
Wine Valley Lodge,The staff were very friendly and made you feel very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family.
Wine Valley Lodge,Room was clean although pool was mostly used by birds for bathing and toileting. It worked since we didn't spend a lot of time at hotel. You come to Napa for wine so it suited our needs just fine
Wine Valley Lodge,Good place for budget. No frills hotel with just the basics and nice staff. It's our go-to place in Napa and allows us to spend our cash on great wines.
Wine Valley Lodge,Nice stay away from the heat!
Wine Valley Lodge,"During my stay I needed to have an extra bed. I had to pay an additional 100 for the additional bed and I ended getting the worst room in the hotel. A room for a disabled person. That not only wasn't clean, but was very bad smell. The room was very hot and even though we had air conditioner, appeared that was not working correctly and still very hot at night."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Room was clean, fresh paint and quiet. Close to downtown and near"
Wine Valley Lodge,Simple yet elegant room for the cost.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Quiet, clean, comfortable, well located motel with good wifi, sparkling swimming pool and extended breakfast hours."
Wine Valley Lodge,The hotel clerk Judy was so helpful with information and friendliness she made us feel like family. But the next day a different clerk was rude! We had an emergency during the night and had to leave. We called back the next day and she was so unconcerned and unfriendly. I guess Judy spoiled us.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Judy was the person I spoke with on the phone, before we went. She was so helpful. When we arrived, she was the hostess. Directed us to hot air balloon ride, wine trip. Very knowledgeable of the area. Very laid back motel."
Wine Valley Lodge,Look DO NOT stay here!!! LMAO!!!
Wine Valley Lodge,"Great stay. Nothing extremely special and included breakfast was so so. Reception was friendly, rooms were clean."
Wine Valley Lodge,"We have family in Napa and visit frequently. This motel is older but well managed and clean.The rooms are a little small. The staff is very nice and knowledgable about the area. The breakfast is cereal, packaged pastries, toast and microwave sausage egg and cheese croissant which was quite good. There is also yogurt, fruit, juice and a coffee machine with several choices. Hotels in Napa are expensive so I consider this motel to be quite a bargain."
Wine Valley Lodge,"This was a good value in the Napa area. It is not located downtown with the restaurants, shops, etc, but is convenient to the freeway and other major streets.The grounds are nicely kept with roses everywhere, the pool area looked nice but it was too cold when we were there to enjoy that. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable the bathroom was a little small, but ok for two people."
Wine Valley Lodge,Only complaint is lack of coffee maker in the room (and lobby!) and the noise level between rooms. Nothing too bad but you definitely know when someone is next store. Pool is small but clean and fairly warm! Loved the ease of parking and availability of maps and coupons for tastings in the lobby.
Wine Valley Lodge,"It was just a quick trip to sleep and move on for the next day, but it served the most important purpose. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The AC was great, and clean room. The continental breakfast was good too, and in a private dining area."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Very nice room. Clean, comfortable. no frills"
Wine Valley Lodge,"The hotel receptionist provided great recommendations for dinner and wine tour/tasting. Internet was a little slow, but AC worked really well (getting the room down to 54 degrees in about an hour) and the bathroom was well laid out with lots of room."
Wine Valley Lodge,"the room was well appointed. there was a large bathroom with a large shower, plenty of towels and lots of light. the room was quiet and the breakfast generous. we would come back here again."
Wine Valley Lodge,It was great place to stay with my family!!!! The picture on the internet don't you how nice is the place. When I choose that hotel I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good one because of the picture!!!!! It was the best hotel to stay after all!!!!good price You shoud up date that pic!!!!
Wine Valley Lodge,"This is not a fancy motel, but it is very clean and comfortable. Very good bed and very clean. Recommend."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Combination business and high school graduation. The only disappointment was no coffee service/equipment in the room and the machine in the lobby was a very long slow process. If they are going to do lobby only, they need to brew in larger volume and put out the pumps as so many other motels are doing across the country."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Every thing at the hotel (it is really a motel) was pleasant except the office smelled of curry. Although I love curry, the reception area should not have such aromas. Also, although the room was very clean and comfortable, there was a very strong smell of disinfectant. When we arrived, the room was already opened I believed to air out the disinfactant smell. Apart from these two set backs, the motel is pleasant and clean."
Wine Valley Lodge,Our stay was very good. This is an excellent value for the Napa area. We were pleasantly surprised and would stay there again.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Stayed two nights with the girlfriend and had a lovely time. Cheap enough to work on a budget, close enough to walk into town."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Clean, quiet, convenient location and extended breakfast hours."
Wine Valley Lodge,Convenient and clean hotel. Comfortable room. Great location for Napa Valley Wine Train. Would stay again.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Great location, place is making lots of renovations, people are great"
Wine Valley Lodge,Our experience was very peaceful and relaxing I would definitely stay there again.
Wine Valley Lodge,only slept there but the 2 queen size beds were comfortable
Wine Valley Lodge,staff here was great and have lots of coupons for local attractions and restauras. be sure to ask.
Wine Valley Lodge,The staff here was wonderful they have a very nice breakfast
Wine Valley Lodge,Always a pleasure to visit Napa to stay WVL...it's our go-to when we visit...close to entertainment and food...the price is right the staff is wonderful
Wine Valley Lodge,Good for the price.
Wine Valley Lodge,Went for the wine tasting. Lovely old timey hotel all updated. Easy drive downtown to catch public 10 vine bus to wineries from here. Near to grocery. Loved this place. Front desk helpful with diections.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Excellent and reasonably - priced place (compared to other places in the region) in a very convenient location. Perfect spot to explore both Napa and Sonoma. Lodge was clean, king size bed very comfortable, and overall spacious enough for this type of room. Breakfast was quite good, with a gourmet coffee machine with many choices, yogurt, fruit, cereal, bagels, bread, spreads, and egg/ham croissants. Thank you to Judy who was very helpful and gave me great info on how to explore Sonoma County and even to Bodega Bay. We did what she recommended, and had an awesome day! She also recommended 3 different places for dinner, all of which were excellent. Overall, highly satisfied with Wine Valley Lodge and will definitely stay here again!"
Wine Valley Lodge,Easy Check-in and convenient parking right outside our room. A traditional Motel which look like it has recently been updated. Good value for the price and the simple breakfast was pleasant and the coffee a quality brew. Recommended.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Upgraded rooms with comfortable beds, refrigerator, easy parking, and close to downtown Napa."
Wine Valley Lodge,New stuff in the continental breakfast now.
Wine Valley Lodge,Everything was fine except when we went into the room it had a musty smell. The bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice but water pressure was very low. Staff were wonderful.
Wine Valley Lodge,"I rarely stayed in the room, so I didn't need much. Mostly I just wanted a quiet, comfortable place to sleep that didn't break the bank. Wine Valley Lodge did exactly that."
Wine Valley Lodge,Shopping centers for food and to eat were within walking distance for me. Great location due to the reason that it was quiet and next to a trail for individuals to walk to. Great service and I really enjoyed it!
Wine Valley Lodge,good location for our trip
Wine Valley Lodge,"if you can handle the thin walls & limited continental breakfast selection, the price is unbeatable! clean & so close to dt napa!"
Wine Valley Lodge,We were looking for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it! This hotel is clean and the right price. Staff was excellent and morning breakfast allowed us to sleep in and not worry about having to drive somewhere for food. We saved enough money to buy nice wine for home so we were happy! We were on our Harley Davidson road king so we had a perfect weekend! I hope the same for you!
Wine Valley Lodge,new stuff in the continental breakfast now.
Wine Valley Lodge,internet? user: wine passwort: valley
Wine Valley Lodge,The owners spoke every morning. They were engaging and caring. Beds were so comfortable. Microwave and refrigerator in room ..In a quiet neighborhood..nice surroundings..in walking distance to shops and restaurants
Wine Valley Lodge,Very nice Basic lodgings. Room clean and comfortable. staff very personable.
Wine Valley Lodge,"We stayed here for the Bottle Rock music festival at the Napa Fairgrounds. It was about a mile away. Great location and close to downtown Napa. While the room was a bit small, it suited our needs just fine. The free breakfast was okay. The line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of those complicated things that you had to choose which type of coffee or espresso you wanted and then wait for it to pour. No milk or half n half, just flavored creamers."
Wine Valley Lodge,Alls good for the price
Wine Valley Lodge,"Good location, has a pool, the size of the room was perfect for a quick weekend trip. Downtown is about a little over a mile away. The bed was comfy, and the staff were friendly. Good price."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Nothing fancy, but for the price it was great. Compared to other rooms and rates I would do it again in a heart beat. In Napa, you are out and about all day anyway."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Motel is a very basic but in good condition and recetly remodeled. It is nothing fancy but has been recently remodeled and the management works hard at maintaining it. Beds were very comfortable and the room had everything (refrigerator, micro) but lacked a coffee pot but breakfast was served in the morning across from the office. Wish the pool was heated though since it would have been nice to take a dip latter in day after wine tasting in Napa."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Cheap , affordable and very quite hotels. Breakfast was meh , staff is alright and the room is quite comforting."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Came to explore Napa and Sonoma, this was a perfect location to stay. Right in the middle of everything we wanted to see. Breakfast wasn't great, some microwavable breakfast sandwiches and cereal."
Wine Valley Lodge,Staff here was great and have lots of coupons for local attractions and restauras. Be sure to ask.
Wine Valley Lodge,"We chose here for a budget stay at Napa Valley. Upon checking in we were very pleased by the friendliness of the staff. Arriving late in the afternoon, we were given great suggestions on how to make the most out of the remaining time. When we left the next day, we had forgotten a mobile charger in the room, but the lodge kindly offered to mail it to us. Great service."
Wine Valley Lodge,"This hotel had only two large towels, and no coffee service in room. The bed however was comfortable. The hotel is in a rundown old neighborhood. The continental breakfast was skimpy, and didn't open until 7 am. We decided to eat breakfast elsewhere after looking at what was there. I would not recommend this hotel. ( I am not a picky person either)."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Was a good budget hotel, however the rooms need serious updating. Walls are thin and you could hear conversation of people in the room next to you. Room was clean. Pool area looked nice but was too cold to enjoy. Breakfast was disappointing...coffee machine, cereal, danishes, and yogurt."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Pleasantly surprised, as my expectations weren't very high. Bed was super comfortable. Nicely redone bathroom with granite. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Although this hotel is rated for 2 stars, but I was happy for all the amenities it provided. It even includes a nice self help breakfast which is not bad at all."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Right near the heart of Napa. Clean and well kept rooms, adequate breakfast and really great staff. Could not have asked for more for the price. Large room and very quiet."
Wine Valley Lodge,"My family of four stayed at the Wine Valley Lodge for 3 nights. We liked this place because it fit our budget and the location is excellent - easy access to the highways for Napa and Sonoma wine valley drives, and 5 minutes to downtown Napa for restaurants, cafes and shops. There is also a CVS on the corner within walking distance and across the boulevard from CVS there's a shopping strip with a supermarket, pizza restaurant, laundromat, and other conveniences. We have no complaints about the motel-style Wine Valley Lodge. Our room was clean, the 2 Queen sized beds were very comfortable, our mini-fridge and TV worked just fine, and we appreciated the heated outdoor pool and the free daily continental breakfast, served 7am - 10am. The front desk staff and the housekeeping staff were courteous and friendly too."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Manager was very helpful, and room was adequate for the price."
Wine Valley Lodge,Clean hotel with comfortable bed. Nice outdoor patio with small pool. Quiet during the night.
Wine Valley Lodge,"The room was clean and had been majorly updated since the last time we stayed here. All the staff we encountered were very nice. The location was convenient, we could walk to a few restaurants and drug stores. The continental breakfast was way above average with hot meat-egg-cheese sandwiches for those who like it plus toast, cereal, yogurt, and fresh fruit."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Needs to be updated. Paint was chipped in the walls, furniture looked outdated. Loud neighbors. You can hear everything"
Wine Valley Lodge,"Fantastic location, food shopping across the street with unbeatable prices, very central location in Napa, walking distance to town center. Clean room, well maintained, could take a new carpet..."
Wine Valley Lodge,Easy parking. Clean and comfortable. Great location.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Cheap, Low End Hotel, But great on a budget for Napa."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Friendly and accommodating, and a good value for the price. Very nice staff and satisfying breakfast served every morning. Everything looked and felt clean except the carpet, which felt grimy and oily under my feet. Hotels like this are often stingy with towels, but here, as also is often the case, you are welcome to more if you ask."
Wine Valley Lodge,Cool old fashioned motor lodge. Clean rooms for a good price. No frills but you get what you pay for. Wifi was useless
Wine Valley Lodge,good for the price but wifi was on off could never keep a signal long enough to use.
Wine Valley Lodge,room had an odor
Wine Valley Lodge,Black mold on the shower? Spiders in my room? Stinky upon entry? All a check!
Wine Valley Lodge,"The hotel is nice and in a quiet area, not luxury, but comfortable and within distance of Napa Valley"
Wine Valley Lodge,They thought it was fine
Wine Valley Lodge,This is a great budget choice. Old style motel charm. Clean and safe with a friendly staff.
Wine Valley Lodge,"Typical road motel that hasn't been updated in awhile but the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. If you're looking for luxury, elegance, and price-gouged frou frou accommodations, go someplace else. If you're smart, and would rather spend your hard-earned money on fine wine and dining as well as on pampering yourself (Calistoga mud baths!), this is a safe clean place to lay down your head. Just a short 3 minute drive to downtown Napa, and easy access to the main highway leading to all the wineries. Surprisingly good coffee. The free breakfast is enough to get you on the road but the breakfast itself is fairly mediocre."
Wine Valley Lodge,"The hotel was very quaint and nice. The beds were so comfortable. A great, inexpensive place to stay. Will definitely book this place again."
Wine Valley Lodge,A lot of workers arguing and room Wasn't done at check-in but otherwise it was fine
Wine Valley Lodge,"The bed was comfy and the room was clean. Nothing fancy, breakfast was a nice touch."
Wine Valley Lodge,Pros: Large room with spacious open area. Fridge microwave. Super friendly front desk and housekeeping staff. Very quiet. Cons: Tiny stall shower Seriously! Several bugs a larger than life spider were crawling in the room. The pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of the parking lot. No thank you. The free breakfast is actually just packaged goods (providing a toaster over does not make it a hot breakfast). The coffee was...disappointing.
Wine Valley Lodge,Just a stop over on our way. Convenient to wine country. Short drive to downtown Napa. This is NOT s destination property. One night was plenty. Old 1950's style motor court that is clean.
Wine Valley Lodge,Had a fabulous time and will definitely return. Perfect location!
Wine Valley Lodge,"We needed the room for a one night stay, as we were interested in going on the Napa Wine Train, for lunch. Our room was big and the beds were very comfy. We are thinking about going again next year and will definitely book at this hotel. The clerk who checked us in was very friendly at check in time. Even though it was not a big brand hotel, this is where I will be staying from now on!"
Wine Valley Lodge,"It was okay, nothing special. The room was very small, and very noisy from the next rooms. The breakfast area also felt crowded. High price for such a small room in an ordinary hotel in a less than okay neighborhood."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Very nice room, all the comforts of home."
Wine Valley Lodge,"This is an older hotel that is neat, clean, and a really good value for the price. We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay there again."
Wine Valley Lodge,The hotel is very outdated. The room had a musty smell to it. Stains were on carpet shower They definitely need a make over. Judy is the one who checked us in. She was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go. This was the best part of the stay.
Wine Valley Lodge,look do not stay here!!! lmao!!!
Wine Valley Lodge,"The hotel was great. It was clean, the breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay there again. We really just needed a place to sleep because most if the time we were out and about. The bed was very comfortable so I would say the Wine Valley Lodge served it's purpose perfectly."
Wine Valley Lodge,"It was basic housing, clean, convenient."
Wine Valley Lodge,"The hotel is older but very well maintained. The room was large and clean. It only had a shower, but that's all I needed. WiFi had a good, fast Internet connection and it was easy to connect. The hotel has satellite TV with enough channels to keep you entertained. The person who checked me in was helpful with giving advice on where to go for food and attractions. The hotel has a breakfast in the morning. The breakfast consists of drinks (coffee, orange juice, milk, etc) and danish, cereals, etc. There are no waffles. All in all there is good value here."
Wine Valley Lodge,nice place to sleep. reasonable and clean. good location
Wine Valley Lodge,Great location for a modest price. Had everything our group needed for our trip to Napa wineries. Very pleasant and helpful staff.
Wine Valley Lodge,"If you can handle the thin walls & limited continental breakfast selection, the price is unbeatable! Clean & So close to DT Napa!"
Wine Valley Lodge,"A great deal for Napa. Decent breakfast, Clean rooms, Central pool."
Wine Valley Lodge,stayed last year. came back. we just need a place to sleep and werent looking for the 300 experience --- why be in a room when you are in NAPA
Wine Valley Lodge,Need better coffee setup
Wine Valley Lodge,"Very clean, nice breakfast (simple), this is a good value for Napa. It was a little noisy and the bed was firm for me, but I like a softer bed. Friendly staff and good location to get on the main highways. Definitely would choose it again."
Wine Valley Lodge,walls are paper thin. the snoring man lady night may as well have been in our room.
Wine Valley Lodge,Great little hotel in the heart of wine country. Staff was very helpful with all questions. Made great suggestions.
Wine Valley Lodge,Internet? User: wine Passwort: valley
Wine Valley Lodge,Very friendly staff and room was clean and comfortable (especially the bed). Continental breakfast was ok. Close to shopping and the wine train.
Wine Valley Lodge,"a great deal for napa. decent breakfast, clean rooms, central pool."
Wine Valley Lodge,"It was pretty comfortable, but the walls are very thin and the maids cleaning at 7:30am made a very loud racket, talking loudly and vacuuming. It was impossible to sleep past 7:30am."
Wine Valley Lodge,"Nothing spectacular but price is right. Continental breakfast is not fancy but it has variety of bread, juice, etc. I think I got what I expected."
Wine Valley Lodge,Old School kind of place nicely remodeled will stay again.
Wine Valley Lodge,"IT WAS EVERYTHING A MOTEL SHOULD BE: REASONABLY PRICED, CLEAN, COMFORTABLE AND QUIET. A BREAKFAST ROOM WITH FRUIT, COFFEE, TEA, BREAKFAST SANDWICHES, YOGURT AND PASTRIES. NICE TOILETRIES. IT'S AN OLD MOTEL, NOT THE LATEST DECOR BUT FOR THE AMENITIES YOU DO GET, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT."
Wine Valley Lodge,All good except breakfast. Would have like to see some boiled eggs. No protein. Ate elsewhere.
Chelsea Inn,"We totally enjoyed our stay! The room was affordable, clean and comfortable. The people at the front desk were kind and helpful. We found the neighborhood to be safe with easy access to public transportation. We will definitely return!"
Chelsea Inn,This hotel was very clean. The staff very nice and helpful. It's close to several shops and restaurants. I felt safe at all times. It's maybe a little over a mile to Ghirardelli Square and the Wharf. My only dislike was not having a computer for guests use. The Internet connection was very good.
Chelsea Inn,"We stayed here for 2 nights in June 2015 before driving up the coast of California Oregon. The building is older but the accommodations were great, room was clean and everything worked fine. It sits on a corner and it can get quite loud. Mohammed (at the front desk) was nice enough to get us a room that faced... More"
Chelsea Inn,Not clean enough. Staff is not service oriented. Would not stay again.
Chelsea Inn,the room was very clean. staff was very good. very willing to give us info about the area. places to eat and how far we were from the pier and all the attractions on the pier. The only thing missing was a fridge. we did not ask but I think if you are going to pay over 200 per night the room should have all the comforts of home. we will more then likely try more places within that price range to see if we can find anything better.
Chelsea Inn,"I'm rating this 5 as an overall rating, but there are pros and cons. Location is amazing! You can't ask for more, you are in a safe and beautiful part of San Francisco. Lost of very good places to eat in the area, great liquor and convenience stores, amazing whole foods shop, close to the coast (walking distance to lots... More"
Chelsea Inn,Felt safe for myself and car. Good location. Front desk was great
Chelsea Inn,"Stayed 3 nights. We loved that the parking was included. The staff was pleasant. The room was large and clean. The location of the hotel is one block south of Chestnut st. Plenty of restaurants and shop near by. Lombard crooked street is also walking distance. However, it is an uphill direction, if you are not use to hiking I... More"
Chelsea Inn,It was really nice and comfortable
Chelsea Inn,"This was a nice little motor inn with friendly and helpful staff. The room was a nice size for being right in the heart of San Francisco, the price was reasonable, and it was very clean. As a great bonus, there was free parking if you got there early and we felt very safe leaving our car there. The hotel... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Comfortable, free parking is a huge plus! We had a corner unit and the street noise was a bit loud but quieted down in the late evening."
Chelsea Inn,Checking in we informed the desk that my race bike had been stolen the morning we arrived and would need to rent a bike for my triathlon that weekend. Told that no bikes were allowed in the rooms. The main purpose of this trip was to race the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon and this hotel is close to the venue.... More
Chelsea Inn,"Rooms are a bit dated, however very large and clean. Staff fixed up the room every day and restocked everything. Great location, near great dining choices. Would recommed to anyone."
Chelsea Inn,"Great room and comfy bed. Be aware that there is no AC, but it was cool enough to leave the windows open. There was a portable fan."
Chelsea Inn,Great room and location! 2nd time in 6 months we stayed at your hotel and we will be back! Thank u
Chelsea Inn,They start loading trucks in the alley at 3AM. Super loud and annoying! Avoid if you sleep light.
Chelsea Inn,Great time. Perfect location. Close to all tourist attractions. You can see the golden gate bridge from room.
Chelsea Inn,"Thought it was a real nice place for the price, plenty of basic things to do within walking distance of hotel. Would stay there again."
Chelsea Inn,Stains on carpet were unseemly. Bed made me itch. Free parking was good though.
Chelsea Inn,"When we were looking for somewhere to stay in San Francisco, we initially wanted to stay either in Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square area, but it was crazy expensive. So I looked at some motels and came across Chelsea Motor Inn. Price was reasonable and initially when we were looking at getting a car there is free parking, so quite... More"
Chelsea Inn,"We arrived early, before 4pm check in. asked if we could check in early. Was told room would be ready 1pm. Returned 3 and room still not ready. Mentioned to hotel and they said we were early, THEN WHY TELL US IT WOULD BE READY AROUND 1PM Just say NO early check in! I would definitely stay again. Located near shopping, restaurants, public transportation. Very nice place."
Chelsea Inn,"Nice place to stay while in San Francisco. Free parking is a plus, location is close to fisherman so wharf, lots of local restaurant nearby"
Chelsea Inn,"Very large room with central air so no need to worry about noise from street. The Marina district is a very good location to tour SF. We walked to the bay and over to the Wharf, picked up the trolley and made it all around without too much effort. This is a good choice if you don't want to spend... More"
Chelsea Inn,The room was adorable quite comfy. Great deal for the price!
Chelsea Inn,Been coming to the Chelsea for over 30 years and it is located in the marina district so is very convenient to everything in that area. Not fancy but well maintained.
Chelsea Inn,"We enjoyed the hotel for its ambience, wish they had provided a microwave and/or a refrigerator that would have made it perfect. It's location was perfect for us."
Chelsea Inn,We had a great time here our hotel was clean and easy to get about however you need a taxi a lot a nice walk to fishermans wharf nice cafes there also you must ride the trams as go up some very big hills amazing views
Chelsea Inn,"Stopped here for four nights. Good location for Fishermans Wharfe area. You can either walk if feeling energetic or it's easy to catch a bus. The Big Bus Hoho stops outside so that's a plus. Lots of options for places to eat nearby. Had breakfast at Bay Watch cafe nearby a couple of times-reasonable price, quick service, food not bad.... More"
Chelsea Inn,"The hotel staff was very friendly. The rooms were well kept. The prices were decent, not great, and the neighborhood was so so. Some good food in the area, but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel. No options for room service, and the pillows were pretty uncomfortable. They do offer one free parking space for your vehicle, which is unusual for San Francisco. All and all, I might stay there again, but there are better options."
Chelsea Inn,"I usually stay at their sister hotel across the street, but they were full this time. I was quite satisfied with the Chelsea."
Chelsea Inn,"Wifi, slow and unstable. Rooms near the streets are loud and noisy."
Chelsea Inn,"We try and stay at the Chelsea Motor Inn when we go to the city. The rooms are large, clean, and have they have king size beds. They also have free garage parking. The neighborhood gets noisy at night so bring earplugs! If you want a quieter room ask for 103 or 106 they are interior rooms so it shouldn't be so noisy."
Chelsea Inn,"Nice and comfortable, good parking, and in a good neighbor, only wifi was extremely slow, the rest good"
Chelsea Inn,"Windows were very thin and being on the 2nd floor, you could still hear everything outside. Made for difficult sleeping if you are a light sleeper."
Chelsea Inn,"PROs of this hotel: 1) Rate was great for SF motel and had a room that could accomodate family of 5 (larger room and we got a rollaway bed that fit fine at extra cost) 2) free underground parking - major plus in this city 3) great location as far as restaurants and stores nearby and safe neighborhood very upscale,... More"
Chelsea Inn,"All the staff was friendly and helpful. I felt very safe, I liked you had to use your room key to use the elevator."
Chelsea Inn,Had a great time in SF
Chelsea Inn,"Perfect hotel for sight seeing in San Fransisco! Close to everything, easy in out of hotel. Within minutes from Alcatraz, Fishermans Wharf, Giradelli Square, Cable cars and Lombard Street. Only down side was very slow wifi, but go 2 blocks to Starbucks and you are good as gold."
Chelsea Inn,it was swell
Chelsea Inn,"My husband participated in the Escape from Alcatraz triathlon so we wanted something close to the marina area. This was the perfect location for us! (We could see the Golden Gate Bridge from our room) 313. The hotel was clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced! The staff was friendly, especially Alan and Erwin. The maid service was terrific and the best part for us was the free parking. We used our car a lot!! The 2 biggest negative's were the Wifi. ( it was basically nonexistent) We had to upgrade our plan twice through verizon but ended up with 6 free gigs/mo through a promotion we were told about when we called in route to Yosemite! And the other potential negative was the quality of the windows. There were nights we could hear the wind howling and the noise from the street but I'm not a light sleeper so it didn't bother me. (Just bring ear plugs in case you can't sleep from the outside noise). Oh and if you keep walking up Lombard Street from the hotel (1.5 miles approx.) you'll come across the famous crookedest St on Lombard St. !! It's hilly but worth the challenge! In closing I would stay here again!"
Chelsea Inn,"Very happy and impressed from the moment we laid eyes on the property. Our room was clean and pretty much exactly what we expected from what we read on Trip Advisor. Staff and cleaners were very good and always happy to help. Special mention to Mohammed who was especially helpful with not only helping us with directions around San Francisco,... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Wonderful hotel in a very convenient location: clean, spacious, charming, with character, bay windows and everything you need! (Including free parking!) Although it was not cheap (good luck with that in SF!) it provided great and comfortable base for our family for a few days while exploring San Francisco. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, China Town, beautiful... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Hotel is right on HWY 101, so traffic rumbling all night. Noisy place so bring ear plugs!"
Chelsea Inn,"I stayed at the Chesea last month for the third time in as many years and was still more than happy with the accommodations. The hotel is not super fancy, but the rooms are very spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff is exceptional! Contrary to some previous reviews, there are refrigerators available for... More"
Chelsea Inn,Wife and I stayed one night. The room was clean and comfortable.
Chelsea Inn,"Easy check in. Polite Staff and helpful also. Very clean and comfortable. Good size bathroom, Good housekeeping services. Small refrigerator provided for 5.00 per day. Right on bus line and they have parking lot. Close to many restaurants within one mile and easy to walk to. Can walk to Fisherman's wharf in about 10-15 minutes. There is a great heath food store/deli 3 blocks away. There is a lot of street noise so we asked for a room in the back of the hotel which solved the problem for us."
Chelsea Inn,"We purchased two nights from Hotwire for a weekend in SF and ended up being very pleased with the Chelsea. Front desk service was top notch. Muhammed and Allan both offered great customer service. Our room was on the west side of the building, with a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The windows opened to let in the... More"
Chelsea Inn,Had a wonderful two days at the hotel and the Cow Hollow neighborhood.
Chelsea Inn,"Scheduled a two day stay here as a starting point for a 2 week vacation. Ended up extending our stay here to 4 days because of the convenience of location, easy access to great restaurants within walking distance, and good value for the money. The parking garage is definitely a plus"
Chelsea Inn,"We had a great experience here from the minute we checked in, until we checked out. This place isn't a 5 star resort, but if you're looking to come to San Francisco and not just sit in your hotel room, it's a great place to stay! The neighborhood was fun had a ton of great restaurants in the area. It's about 10 min walk to the Golden Gate Bridge... The staff is helpful and kind, the beds are soooooo comfy the room is clean. I read some bad reviews about noise, but honestly we had no problems sleeping any of the 3 nights we were there. We would definitely recommend this hotel to people that aren't looking to stay in their rooms the whole time. We basically dropped out stuff went and explored the city. The only time we came back to the room was to sleep and shower and change. I would say to buy a case of water because they have a vending machine in the hall but it's 2 for one bottle of water."
Chelsea Inn,The Wifi never worked properly. It would say we were connected but kicked us off. Over all an okay hotel if you're just looking for some place to shower and sleep. The hotel is a bit out dated but provided us what we needed. We liked that our car was safe and in the parking garage as well. Who stays in the hotel anyway when you have the entire city to see.
Chelsea Inn,Real close to city events
Chelsea Inn,"It was a good two night stay. The front desk was beyond helpful and accommodating. There was plenty of good food and nightlife right up or down the road. It's in the marina so the view is great, so is the location. The room was clean and tidy the whole stay. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of space around it."
Chelsea Inn,The Chelsea is in a great location. We had no issues checking in or with parking. Our room was large and clean. I would definitely stay here again.
Chelsea Inn,"Excellent location. The MUNI (local bus) bus stop is right across the street, where you can take bus 30 to go to Golden bridge. Rooms are clean. They have covered parking.

Chelsea Inn,Been coming to San Francisco every year now for the past 4 yrs and this hotel has been by far the best one yet. Will definitely be booking again for next year!
Chelsea Inn,Hotel was very nice worth the money will stay there again. And free parking cant beat that.near to evrything.we were very pleased.
Chelsea Inn,Best value in the city. Could see Golden Gate from our room!
Chelsea Inn,"On third floor and elevator was broken for the first day of our stay. Maid service seemed to forget to do something each day: no clean towels, beds not made, no tea bags/coffee replaced. Quite accommodating to us for early check-in."
Chelsea Inn,Lots of stains on carpeting. Loud people outside all night.
Chelsea Inn,"Nice, comfortable room in a great location. Free covered parking and several restaurants close by. Multiple problems with room key."
Chelsea Inn,"Great value, location is perfect. Hotel is next to a bar so it can get loud but with the AC and TV on it wasn't bad. Free parking and a bus stop at the door it's very convenient and huge plus. Considering how overpriced everything in San Francisco is this was a deal! Hotel was older but staff was friendly and breakfast was in walking distance. Do yourself a favor park your car at hotel and leave it there take bus 30 to cable cars, Lombard street and the wharf."
Chelsea Inn,"Stayed for three nights,very friendly staff gave us a lot of advice and directions . Good location, bus 30 one block away took us to the baseball stadium to watch Giants. Bought tickets night before on stub hub for 8 each bargain! Nice large rooms ,bit noisy in the early hours with garbage trucks at the side other than that... More"
Chelsea Inn,This is an older style motor hotel which is on the Hop On Hop Off bus route. The rooms are large and well maintained. The beds are comfortable.

Chelsea Inn,Reasonable rate. Clean room pleasant staff. Pick up tour right outside motel
Chelsea Inn,We stayed here for two nights in July and loved it! Good price for SF and we loved the location. The room was much larger than we expected and with very nice furnishings.

Chelsea Inn,"Hubby and I really enjoyed our stay here, very easy to use public transport if you wish to leave the car behind and not have the hassle of having to drive or park when seeing the sights. Room was large with a wonderful bed and good quality linen. En suite was large and very clean with a wonderful bath -... More"
Chelsea Inn,I was in San Francisco for a triathlon. This hotel is very close to the race site. I like this location is it is really close to the bus. It is also close to a number of very good resturants.
Chelsea Inn,"The location is very good, 1 block away from Chestnut avenue, filled with trendy bars and restaurants, but if you want to walk to SF's main attractions then not so good. Rooms are outdated but clean. No breakfast nor fridge/microwave. The other great pros are the free parking and free wifi."
Chelsea Inn,We stayed here having been to San Fran a few times before and previously stayed towards financial district/ union square. I personally think this area is far better. A gentle 20 minute walk via fort Mason to fishermans wharf and about 25-30 walk to pier 33 for the ferry to Alcatraz. Chestnut street a block away is a great street... More
Chelsea Inn,Free Parking! That's right! In a GREAT Location with the most comfortable beds! The Staff was wonderful...Especially Muhammed! He went out of his way to help us out! and when I left an important idem in my room they mail it right to me! Loved our stay here! Thanks
Chelsea Inn,"Had my doubts but the office clerks were very helpful and any problems were quickly resolved. The room was clean and did not smell of air freshner. The location is excellent as it is one block from Chestnut St. where there are lots of restaurants, shopping, ATMs and bars. We had a large van and there was plenty of room to park it. One afternoon the office staff even parked it for us as the parking slot was not available when we checked in. Very nice experience!"
Chelsea Inn,We stayed here one night and were very pleasantly surprised. The room decor is very dated but it almost adds to the retro charm of the place. The room was very spacious and clean with a comfy bed so worked great for us. We stayed on 3rd floor and it wasnt any more noisy than I would expect in any... More
Chelsea Inn,"The hotel is a great value, clean and rooms are large. We stayed on a weeknight and the price of hotels in Union Square where I usually stay were twice as high at 450. For 225 a night and free parking (which costs at least 50 a day at hotels like Westin St Francis), we had a really comfortable stay. Marina neighborhood is great for walking. We had street noise outside our window on the 2nd floor, with car alarms and traffic, but our friends staying across the hall and facing a different street reported that their room was quiet."
Chelsea Inn,"Reasonably priced for San Francisco! Nicely appointed room, very clean. My room had a full view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Very close to Fisherman's Wharf. Friendly staff. FREE PARKING!!! I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone!"
Chelsea Inn,Noisy neighborhood due to night lift nearby - soundproofing windows might help.
Chelsea Inn,"We selected this hotel from the review from Tripadvisor. It was reasonably priced and rated pretty high. It was a good selection. We stayed here from July 26th-August 2nd (7 nights). The gentleman at the front desk early in the morning and about 9pm was very rude the entire week, not just to us but to others. There were many... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Hotel is on some busy streets and can be noisy at night. It was clean and adequately equipped, however the bed and bathrooms are out of date. Toilets and shower are not low flow. Location is convenient."
Chelsea Inn,"Met up with other family members for a couple of days in San Francisco. The pluses: hotel is in a great location, rooms were roomy and nicely appointed, parking, restaurants, sight seeing, bike rentals close by. The minuses: wifi not reliable, hotel staff not friendly."
Chelsea Inn,"We wanted to be close to public transportation, the wharf, and attractions. The room was nicely done and we could watch the sunset from our window. We had asked for early check-in but even though they told us we could get in at 2pm they did not have our room ready until the normal 4.00pm check-in. But they did give... More"
Chelsea Inn,"A nice hotel but I dislike paying 200+ for a hotel room--even in San Francisco. Decent room but if you want a mini refrigerator you have to pay extra. While the room was on the quiet side of the hotel, the view was of a concrete wall."
Chelsea Inn,"Looking for a place not too expensive for me and my teenage daughter in a busy yet safe location to explore SF for a few days, I remembered seeing this place when I used to live in SF long time ago. It's in a perfect location to walk to get a neighborhood coffee at 7 a.m. (jet-lag alarm!), around the... More"
Chelsea Inn,It was our first time in San Francisco and we loved the location and comfort of our room.
Chelsea Inn,"The motel is basic but overall nice. The only major problem is that the rooms on Lombard are very noisy. After one night with almost no sleep we asked to move, and luckily there was a room on the 2nd floor that was quieter."
Chelsea Inn,"My wife had a conference in San Jose on Friday, so we thought wed stay the weekend in San Francisco. After long deliberation on where to stay we choose The Chelsea Motor Inn. First the Motel is in a fantastic location. Yes, Lombard Street is busy and very noise, you are within walking distance to everything along the waterfront. That... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Looks like they remodeled the place since my last visit several years ago. Great free parking, nice room overall with everything you need and clean and fresh. Of course facing Lombard you'll have road noise from the busy street, but do not NEVER EVER get a room on the Fillmore side. There is a tiny country bar across the street... More"
Chelsea Inn,"Wonderful Hotel, was very accessible to the Muni bus services which takes you anywhere in the city... no breakfast included but we did have a coffee maker and great service. Safe free parking"
Chelsea Inn,We just stayed here for 3 nights after a 28 day cruise and couldn't have made a better choice. The room was large the bed very comfortable the bathroom updated new large screen television fast wi-fi and great staff. We did have a first floor room on Lombard and there was street noise but relatively quiet at night. San Francisco... More
Chelsea Inn,Considering the other prices for San Francisco hotels this one was a good choice. Cheaper then the rest and good location! The rooms are very nice and there is free parking! No breakfast but tons of cute places in walking distance for that. We didn't have any trouble with noise or falling asleep but we were on the 3rd floor... More
Chelsea Inn,We had a room on the street and it was noisey
Chelsea Inn,"The hotel was roomy, nice and clean. The personal was very helpful in showing us the best way to see the city as a first timer. It was a little further away from the wharth than I expected but still in a good safe area of town."
Chelsea Inn,"We've just spent 3 nights at the Chelsea Motor Inn on the recommendation of a friend. Good location with excellent public transport links, comfortable room, huge bed, with all the necessary amenities. Would recommend a room on the 3rd floor on Fillmore to get a view of the Golden Gate Bridge from your room a bit quieter than the... More"
Chelsea Inn,Missed having a small refrigerator in the room which is a must for travellers to keep cold drinks and such without having to use soda machine.. convenient location but noisy at night.bring your earplugs
Chelsea Inn,A quick trip to the city
Chelsea Inn,"Stayed here for three nights whilst on an epic tour California. Great sized room, the most comfortable bed and served its purpose for us really. Would stay again when back in San Francisco. If you want somewhere nice for breakfast then visit Bay Watch across the road, 10 discount for hotel guest!"
Chelsea Inn,My wife and I stayed here for two days prior to a cruise. We considered this reasonably priced as compared to some of the outrageous prices charged by more upscale hotels nearer to FW. The room was clean and well laid out. We had a room at the rear of the hotel away from the high traffic Lombard St. The... More
Chelsea Inn,"Nice hotel on the corner of Fillmore and Lombard. Missed it at first as the outside sign was not lit. Nice location, plenty of dining options. Quiet enough, parking was good. Frist stop on our trip to Portland with a side tip out to Alcatraz"
Chelsea Inn,"The hotel is located in the marina district and bus stop is just one minute walking so you can reach every important place easily. Room was pretty big with a king size bed and clean. There is parking included in the rate. There is no breakfast in the hotel, but there are many places to have breakfast close. The hotel... More"
Chelsea Inn,Bem localizado. Quarto antigo ao estilo vitoriano bem confort��vel!
Chelsea Inn,Always stay here when in SF. Great location and free parking.
Chelsea Inn,"Hotel staff was cold. They answered our questions curtly and seemed to want us out of the office as quickly as possible. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the decor is old...not charming, simply old and worn. On the Saturday night of our stay there was so much noise outside we could hardly sleep. Sunday night was quieter, but we still had a hard time sleeping because we couldn't get comfortable in the beds! The internet was spotty at best. The positives for this hotel are the garage parking which is included with your stay and the location. There are lots of restaurants just a block away, you can easily walk toward the water for a great view of the bridge, Fisherman's Wharf is walkable as is the zig-zag section of Lombard Street...if you are in good shape and enjoy mountain climbing. LOL! The walk isn't actually that hard and it's all part of the San Francisco experience. This hotel could be a gem with some customer service training for the staff, new beds and an updated decor. It could easily be changed into an adorable, comfy place to stay."
Chelsea Inn,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff was helpful, and courteous to me. The room was spacious, and the view wasn't bad. I really liked the location. If you took a cab to Pier 39, or Fisherman's Wharf the price wad reasonable. There are a lot of restaurants in the area too. Maid service could have been better,... More"
Chelsea Inn,We spent two nights at this hotel. After camping in Yosemite National Park the previous three nights we greatly appreciated the comfort and cleanliness of our spacious room at the Chelsea. The hotel has a great location - a 15 min walk from Fisherman's Wharf and in the evening we could see the sun setting behind the Golden Gate Bridge... More

Nice big room with bay window Friendly staff Con: room was across the street from a bar Windows do not block out any sound so be prepared to not sleep well Street is busy and loud with cars honking all night (again see note about windows) In need of a DEEP clean. Baseboards and edge of... More
Chelsea Inn,"We chose this hotel as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago. Former stay was not on a weekend. The neighborhood street and bar across the street was very noisy Friday and Saturday night. We came to do the Avon 39 walk and had a early wake-up time. The noise went on to at least 3 am. Hotel and amenities are good. The street noise makes it undesirable location. Sorry, but we will not return."
Chelsea Inn,Room 308 & 314 are the best in the Hotel.
Chelsea Inn,"There were three big black marks on carpet. Felt creepy and awkward. At least it didn't look like blood spots. And getting into the room, I must try three times to open. The location of the Inn was convenient for shopping, dining or visiting some points of interests. So made my mind to stay two nights in room number 203."
Chelsea Inn,"This hotel is very nice located in the center of the city close to everything. Very nice restaurants a few block away, KFC in front of the restaurant. An amazing place to have breakfast just around the corner. Other reviewers said they couldn't sleep for the street noise but that does not applied to us. We slept like babies in... More"
Chelsea Inn,"We chose this hotel based on its good reviews and price. Smart idea! Not fancy but a great base for our five day stay. Many good nearby restaurants, bus service outside door, quiet, clean, spacious rooms with friendly staff, easy in building parking.

Chelsea Inn,"Staff was friendly and helped us with planning our two day visit to San Francisco. Parking was free which was amazing! The room was quite clean, hotel was quiet, and awesome location near bars, restaurants, and shops. Highly recommend, affordable rate for an unaffordable city!!!"
Chelsea Inn,Postal trucks start loading at 4:30am and are loud as hell.  :/
Chelsea Inn,"I'm surprised to see people complain about this hotel. When we were searching for a place to stay, we almost couldn't do the San Fran part of our trip because I had such a hard timing finding a place that was affordable AND decently reviewed on TA. Then I found this place mostly positively reviewed. But when I see what... More"
Chelsea Inn,"We arrived here for a couple days and I was pleasantly surprised with our room. For the price I was happy, it was big and roomy and clean. Since we were not going to stay here much the amenities were fine. The parking garage was also a A+ and the location was great. Lots of great restaurants, bars and stores.... More"
Chelsea Inn,"The hotel has a great location in the Marina District - 5 min to bayfront, 20 min to Crooked Lombard St., 5 min to Palace of Fine Arts (a Must!) and a nice 40 min stroll to Golden Gate Bridge.

The staff there is great and they clean your room really good and are very sweet to the customers. If you need something they will get it for you. Mohammad at the front desk is very helpful as anyone... More
Chelsea Inn,"This hotel has some of the best staff out of any hotel I've stayed at. They are helpful, friendly and so accommodating. The room was nice and clean. The neighborhood was great. We would definitely stay here again!"
Chelsea Inn,"Good location to catch Big Bus. Very clean and best was free parking. Not best neighborhood down Filmore, but did not feel threatened. Post Office half block away or you can send mail from front desk. A little noisy, but turned on fan and after about 11pm not much noise."
Chelsea Inn,"We have used the Chelsea for frequent stays over the past 11 years ago. Frankly it has been a bit sketchy at times but the location and free parking the the Chestnut Neighborhood USED to make up for the foibles. However, this last stay I got no fewer than 25 bites from Bedbugs. When I mentioned this to the manager... More"

Chelsea Inn,Rooms were dirty and had a weird smell. Also was super loud at night.
Chelsea Inn,"I was quite pleased. It isn't fancy - the furniture is an older style - but the room was a good size and quiet. The location is very convenient, a block from Chestnut Street, which is the main drag in the Marina area, and right on Fillmore, another major street."
Chelsea Inn,"While researching for a modestly priced hub for our stay, Chelsea Motor Inn fit our needs. It is quite close to many great sights and must sees including Pier 39, Crissy Field, Palace of Fine Arts, and more. The location is within walking distance of many great eateries and coffee shops as it is right on Lombard St. Our room... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,I love it the managers are kind and sweet the rooms are clean and cozy besides the upstairs loud stomping from the room above i give it a 10 overall i recommend this hotel for everyone make sure to book in advance because boy oh boy they most likely get booked up one of the best hotels around classy
Gardena Terrace Inn,"the hotel was clean lets start with that!! that trumps everything in my book. i need a clean room with no critters running around. this place definitely delivered a clean room. warm inviting desk staff super helpful and the hotel had all the amenities i would or could need I found the place cozy clean and inviting. As far as the noise level. you could can definitely hear your neighbors come and go, but i live in hotels pretty much and that happens at the 5 star ones too!! i didnt think there were that many disruptions at all.. and i stayed on the 4th of July!!! did i fly slow motion into the fluffiest bed in the world absolutley not! But i didn't pay an extra 50 to 100 dollars for a fluffy bed either. I got a clean room, good nights sleep in a comfortable bed, with super sweet desk help. for the price i paid on the holiday in Los Angeles i got a steal and i would definitely stay here again. in a heartbeat."
Gardena Terrace Inn,The room was a good experience for the price. It has been recently remodeled and was clean and comfortable. Minimal noise from the other guests or the neighborhood. It's within a 15 minute ride to several beaches. Staff was pleasant to deal with.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The hotel was in a perfect location for us because of where we had to go to that evening (less than 1 mile away). However, the hotel location as in an older run down area. The rooms were clean and well kept, but once outside the room, we did not feel safe in the hotel/motel because the security parking gate and stairways were left wide open all night. Overall, the room was OK, but the hotel safety was a question mark for us. One good thing is that Bob's Hawaiian Food is right next door and has the best Hawaiian food around."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The Gardena Terrace Inn was just a one night stay for us. At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked."
Gardena Terrace Inn,My non-smoking room smelled like smoke. I saw a few questionable things on linen so I refused to sleep in the bed in the housekeeping staff only wanted to change the towels you didn't care about the bed or the trash or anything else. Housekeeping came at different times every day too.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Worst stay ever! I had a reservation for this location, BUT without noticed I was moved to Redondo Beach Pier and it was the worst experience ever!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,Found the room nice for the price
Gardena Terrace Inn,Room was just right for a few nights city of Gardena was great with lots of food and close to the mall and beach restaurant called the pan was incredible on western and 166 street great stay for the price
Gardena Terrace Inn,"THEY WAS VERY NICE . I WAS THEIR TO STUDY FOR A TEST , SO THEY BROUGHT IN A EXTRA TABLE SO I WAS ABLE TO SPEAD MY STUDYS OUT . WORTH THE MONEY ."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I reserved a room with the kitchenette. The first room i checked into had a bad smell and they were nice enough to get me another room. But the cook top didn't work, there were no shampoo and the towels were old. The price is way to high for the room."
Gardena Terrace Inn,I did not expect an 2 stars hotel to be that great. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. It is not luxury but very comfortable. The location is good lots of restaurants and the Del Amo mall 15 minutes away. Breakfast is not provided which was fine for us as we discovered cool places to have brunch. The... More
Gardena Terrace Inn,Just needed a place to sleep and shower. This was comfortable and fit the bill.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"AC unit did not work properly, management told me they just replaced 2 weeks earlier. Also had no working phone for room service to complain about ac. The room is 202 incase you go there."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Room was hot and stuffy upon arrival. Very small and window had no curtains. Smelled kinda like mildew and breakfast was nothing but a packaged pastry.
Gardena Terrace Inn,My stay there was for the convenience to take care of my business in that area
Gardena Terrace Inn,It was ok the carpet wasn't as clean as I would have liked and room was very compact and cleaning crew come and take the remount while your Getting your stuff ready to go
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Got a King-bed room for one night. The room has enough lights, space and clean. I will probably come back for my B-trips."
Gardena Terrace Inn,It was the place we were looking for fersure staying there again sleept good and felt good.
Gardena Terrace Inn,This WAS a regular stay for me in LAX area. Last booking the room reeked of Checch and Chong party. Had to switch hotels......
Gardena Terrace Inn,It was quick and easy to check in and the rooms were nice for the price. There's parking in a garage with cameras everywhere. It was comfortable pretty clean it could be cleaner. The window was old but the interior decorating was nice. There's flat screen tv on the wall and table and chair is updated. The door hits the toilet when you try to close door but not a big deal. The freezer wasn't cold enough and it was a new looking half refrigerator. But overall I would come back here again. I enjoyed my stay for its purpose.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"hotels.com website indicated that a complimentary breakfast would available, but that was not the case. The lighting was from the ceiling and cast a ghostly white color to the room - the kind of lighting that's used to interrogate prisoners"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The whole hotel has been recently remodeled. While my room had a very micebtv, refrigerator and microwave. It lacked a dresser and a coffee maker. I'm an early riser and coffee wasn't available in the breakfast room till 7am."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Non smoking room smelled like smoke could not get the smell out made it difficult to sleep. No shampoo or conditioner in the tub dispenser. No food after 8:30 am
Gardena Terrace Inn,Quite place.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I stayed a night coz I did not want to drive 2 hours back to San Diego in the wee hours of the morning after a night out with friends. Checked in around 3PM... The room was warm as the A/C was not on. So I turned it on and about an hour later, the room was still warm... Why The A/C is one of those window type units and this particular one was right in front of the bed closest to the door so the bed essentially blocked the vents. The room also smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room from what I understood. In the bathroom area, the mirror was resting on the counter behind the faucet as it looked like it had fallen from the hook on the wall. The pillows were lumpy and the sheets/pillow cases were not the softest. But like my title says, I just needed the room to sleep in after night out. I'm not complaining, just stating it as it was. If lumpy pillows and slightly stiff sheets aren't your thing, then this ain't the place for you. Otherwise, it does what it needs to do and serves its purpose."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The area was close to my families house, but the neighborhood is a little sketchy. Overall the hotel was perfect since we only stayed briefly at nights to sleep and were on the go during the days. There is nothing special here. No breakfast (not even coffee or continental as advertised) but it was clean. The front desk staff were nice and got us extra towels and directions."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"After reading TA reviews and seeing great rates on hotel tonight, I was up for trying the hotel. It's definitely a motel style building, with some covered and some uncovered parking (free). There's an open courtyard and multiple levels of rooms. Rooms are just the essentials a bed with pillows, closet with a few hangers, nightstand, table with 2 chairs,... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,The room was very comfortable the staff is very nice.
Gardena Terrace Inn,it was decent
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I was there three days and two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave towels. One of those days that I had to ask for towels, they did not have two sets available. The sheets were dingy and pilly. The continental breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced at a hotel--one day, there was no breakfast left and it was not replenished. You can hear conversations of the room next door through the walls. There is free parking and a great Thai place next door. Staff were friendly."
Gardena Terrace Inn,The hotel was okay to me. The front desk and garage had that ghetto feel but the room was fine to me. We returned to hotel around 10pm one day so the door to front desk was locked. We had to talk to the guy at front desk through a small window on the door (felt like we were talking... More
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The rooms are SO big! Clean and very nice, Would definitely come back again!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"great value, 20min drive from beach. lots of food nearby."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Me and my best friend stayed here for a couple days and absolutely loved it, We even extended our stay! The staff and front desk were so kind and generous to our needs. I will definitely come back here!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The room smelled as though the hotel was trying very hard to cover up the smell of smoke with chemicals and other things. It smelled gross. There was blood on the wall. There was damage to the bathroom door. People were talking right outside our room all through the night, and by morning, the room reeked of cigarette smoke, and that is when I realized the ashtray was three inches from our room's only window, which explained almost all of the aforementioned points. To top things off, a pipe in the garage leaked on our rental car throughout the night, and I had to take our rental car to a car-wash to get the murky watermarks off the car before returning it. My wife and I hotel-hopped throughout our week-long vacation (all of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price), and this was the only hotel we ended up staying that did not have a breakfast, pool, etc., so that doesn't help either when remembering our stay there."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Last Fall, I saw a housekeeper was using the same brush to a wash bath tab and a toilet bowl. She was using a pink brush."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"We arrived late and was very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel. It loozed a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy. We had no choice but to stay because we wereally told that if we didnt,they we would still be charged 172 because they held the room for us. There were cigareties burns all over the jacuzzi, and my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it. The towels were old, dingy and brittle. The deadbolt on the front door didn't work. And,the patio do didn't have any kind of security lock, although the patio was adjacent to another room. Which meant if we had left our things there to go sightseeing, the people in the adjacent room could've easily broken into our room and stolen our things. To add insult to injury,the hotel charged my credit card twice and I had to call them about it and then wait days for them to return the other 172 that I clearly needed to pay for another hotel, since I was on vacation. The overall experience was very disappointing and caused a serious decline in the quality of our vacation..."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I stayed here for five nights and was totally satisfied. There is ample free parking, the courtyard is pleasant, and the room was spacious, clean and came with a refrigerator. As others have said, the owners and staff are friendly. Free coffee and danish pastry is provided in the morning it's simple but a nice extra provided by this budget... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,Good and comfortable stay and once again very affordable.. It's not ritz Carlton but it's what we needed wake up get dressed leave and come back to sleep
Gardena Terrace Inn,"This a nice hotel, clean, near of restaurants, and near to the stuff hub center, I went to LA to see a box fight and the hotel it was perfect to stay one weekend and enjoy LA, the only bad thing is that is far from LA downtown."
Gardena Terrace Inn,the place was okay to just spend the night
Gardena Terrace Inn,I would have something to say with I had a terrible experience. But so far everything was good except elevator which is a little slow.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The hotel was located near the event we were attending so it was convenient for us, but we probably won't stay there again. The room didn't have a dresser to put clothes away and the bar in the closet was coming off the wall. The shower was pretty bad. The pressure was too hard and you couldn't adjust it. We could hear the pipes rattle through the walls, when our neighbors would use their sink. We stayed there for a week and actually thought about checking out early to stay somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend this place."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"After commuting over 12 hours from Puerto Rico this little Inn next door to airport was a sight for soar eyes and bones. Clean, easy check-in, staff ready to serve, WiFi so you can catch-up to emails. The neighborhood seemed safe and CVS right across the street.

Gardena Terrace Inn,Overall is was a good stay. Clean rooms and the restrooms were clean also.
Gardena Terrace Inn,Very disappointed in the room.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"California was enough as is, I was seriously just happy to be there!! The vibes and food was amazing! I was not thinking much about the hotel, but to give it a rating it was alright place to lay your head at night!! Shower was really nice and the water felt amazing. It helped me sleep at night!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Room was small but very comfortable. A/C was good. Bed was soft and comfortable, as was the pillows. Good shower pressure! Parking was easy. Only a small table to eat, but it was just me. Would definitely stay here again!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The hotel room was a perfect size and was always clean when we got back from our activities. The front desk was always helpful. The manager, Ali was very nice and made us feel very welcome. Definetly recommend and the price was reasonable ! We will be coming back next time we visit Gardena, CA."
Gardena Terrace Inn,This place was excellent. Exactly what me and my friend needed after a long day of traveling. The guy by the name of Ankit who works there is an absolute legend.

Gardena Terrace Inn,"It is a very nice and clean place. The lady at the reception was very nice. The room is spacios and tidy. The bed sheets are crispy fresh. The only thing is if you are planning to have breakfast there, do not have high expectations-they only offer coffee, milk and cereal."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Room was renovated well. Great quality look throughout. Only complaints are the details - outlet covers were dirty and tub barely drained water. Location was ok, but near tons of good stuff."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Had a late check in and had to register through a glass window while standing in the cold garage. That made me super skeptical. Got to my room and it was okay. Broken mirror, destroyed room phone, but other than that it got the job done. I honestly just didn't feel completely safe in the area. At 11p when I step out my room there were random young adults just hanging around the terrace. They were there when I left and when I returned. There was no security. Doubtful I'll return, but for the price, for some it'll get the job done. The online pictures and reviews are what I went by but had an entirely different feel and experience when I stayed."
Gardena Terrace Inn,The towels were dirty . The wall need fresh paint. The room door was broken so it did dont lock securely like it was supposed to the boltlock was broken. No clocks in the room just an broken telephone. It wasn't not what expected but in all it was pretty clean the neighborhood was great and the customer service was great.
Gardena Terrace Inn,Walls and doors needed wiped down to the point I did it myself. The towels were terrible the worst I ever had in any hotel or motel
Gardena Terrace Inn,wonderful
Gardena Terrace Inn,It's worth the money. Nothing special
Gardena Terrace Inn,"We stayed at this hotel for a night, and the checkin/checkout was smooth. The room was relatively large for the price point, and it included a kitchenette. Free on-premise parking, free wi-fi, and large room at a sub-100 price. Great overall!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Only issue was that I requested a non smoking room, but I got a room which clearly has had smokers in it before. I'm sure if I would've complained they would have fixed the issue, so it's not a big deal. It was more on my end not Caring enough to complain. Other than that the place is good. Wouldn't mind staying here again."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Me and my family attempted to stay here during this recent President Valentine weekend. The pictures posted for the property are completely deceiving. This place looked run down with dirty bedding, funny room smell, paint worn on walls, and the rooms Windows were left open with mosquitoes everywhere. I have stay in many hotels and this was the first I... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Stayed for just a quick night. Was pleasantly surprised. This looks as if it were once an old crummy hotel but they really did try with the upgrades. Carpet looked a little dirty and it looked as if someone wrote graffiti on the mirror at one time, but it had been cleaned. The bathroom was clean, the shower worked just great. They do skimp on the towel and toilet tissue quality but compared to the other hotels on this street, I definitely felt safer and cleaner here."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Visited as a couple during January weekend. It's a quiet little place. Nothing fancy, but a comfortable stay. Close to CVS, gas station, Target, and a plaza with Asian food (boba, dim sum, late night snacks). Pros: - free parking - free wifi - clean rooms - microwave and fridge Cons: - lack of towels - a bit noisy Overall... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,Recently stayed at Gardena Terrace Inn and had the most amazing experience. I was trying to find a great hotel for my girl and I to relax and get some rest and came across Gardena Terrace. I'm so pleased with the service and professionalism of the management there. I had to share with tripadvisor.com
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Decent, clean place to stay. Not very far from the beaches and LAX. Worth the money. Would have been happier had they provided some simple breakfast."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Loved staying at the Gardena Terrace, a very nice little hotel in Gardena Ca. Everything from parking to room to facilities was just right. I needed help with a number of things, and Katherine on the front desk did not rest until everything was resolved. Recommended."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Horrible. Don't stay here. Unclean room with unclean sheets. Sketchy neighborhood creepy room over all, musty smell. A/C doesn't work properly. Spend the money and stay somewhere else."
Gardena Terrace Inn,I hated this hotel. They were not honest and tried to get us to cancel with hotels.com and then pay them direct. They even did something to our reservation to make it not go through by putting wrong date in after we told them no. We had to wait 2 hours to get the room only to find no coffee pot and a honey bun for the so-called free breakfast the next day. I will never stay there again and they lied they were not near LAX.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Front desk lady was great, super nice. no phones in rooms so my 4:30 wake up call did not happen. The stairs to the garage was extreemly dirty"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I requested a non-smoking room. I was given a room that smelled like Cheech and Chong died in it. I requested a different room and one given one that was slightly better, but still smelled of Marijuana. Overall I was very unhappy with this hotel. I did not feel safe in the room and I will not stay there again."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Will not stay again!
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The only complaints are: pillows are flat!! And the night time guy on is not friendly at all!! And we stay there a couple times a year! There was a guy named Keith that worked there and was great! The gentleman that works days is very, very nice!!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,This was my second stay in their deluxe king suite and I'll be back. I love the fact that the Jacuzzi tub is near the bed.
Gardena Terrace Inn,Me and my girlfriend apsolutely loved it we felt right at home. The bed was just as comfortable as at home and we felt great being in a super clean invironment. We liked it so much we even staied an extra night. The housekeepers are right on task each morning. And the front desk people are very very generous.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Our shower drain was soooo slow that you had to shower fast so it would not overflow, by the elevator there was a broken mirrored sliding door that sat on some folded up chairs the 4 days we stayed there."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Looking for hotels in the greater Los Angeles area for New Year's Eve and the next night + looking pretty much right around Christmas day (so lagging hard) + traveling on a budget not a lot to work with! My boyfriend and I were coming to the LA area for a NYE event in Long Beach and then another... More
Gardena Terrace Inn,Surprisingly nice little hotel in Gardena. Needed a place to stay for the night so I gave the Terrace Inn a shot and it was great for the price.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I would not recommend this hotel, I paid 152 a night and let me say my stay was okay was not what I had expected. The room had a bad odor and it did not seemed to be clean enough for my taste. The sheets were stained yellow and the bathroom shampoo and conditioner smelled bad, good thing I always carry my own. Seemed as if its remodeled but I think if I ask for a non smoking room they should put sheets with holes in them after being in a room that was for people who smoke. Dont think I would stay here again. I just wanted something close and not too expensive and turned out to be the same."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"We arrived in LA with no hotel booked, and found this place after looking for a motel. We had booked on line and they had the booking when we arrived. Staff very helpful and we were checked in quickly. The room its self was nice - had a little kitchenette twin beds and plenty of space. Bathroom was nice and... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"everything was good unless the breakfast. It,s not fair to pay 170 for 2star hotel with breakfast and get coffee, milk and pastry."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Nice and clean .. I always stay here ..decent prices.
Gardena Terrace Inn,very bad ....breakfast was nothing no swimming pool ...no coffee maker ..we were unhappy there ...
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Stayed about 3 weeks there. Very pleasant. It was a joy to interact with the resident manager and his wife. I was always asked if I needed anything. The hotel and surrounding area felt safe. The hotel was very quite and our room was well insulated from noise from the adjacent rooms. Although there were other guest, it felt like... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"We stayed at the start and end of our trip primarily because it was inexpensive and reasonably close to LAX. The area is quite Japanese and has some good restaurants nearby. It's also quiet. A large undercover car park was handy for us to park our motorbike. We also took advantage of the central courtyard, which was pleasant. We didn't... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The location was good. Everything was 20 minutes away. However, the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down. I would have stayed somewhere else."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Not so good
Gardena Terrace Inn,Really nice and comfortable
Gardena Terrace Inn,There were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink. The room was smaller then anticipated little disappointed with their laundry service.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"How this place only gets 2 stars amazes me. 5 mile south of the airport made it an ideal place to stay overnight. Also only a few minutes to hit the LA freeways. Large, spotless and quiet room and bathroom. Secure parking. Breakfast basic but we didn't want anything else - you could shout yourself a big breakfast with the... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,You get what you pay for. So don't expect it to be like the Sheraton or something. Rooms were nice and well equipped. Staff was friendly but I had to wait for someone to come because the office was locked.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The front desk guys were awesome! Came in a little earlier and he made it possible that I check in earlier. This is a pretty small hotel that is quite old but they re-did everything inside the rooms. Nice bed, pillows, tv and a mini kitchen/sink/fridge set up. Will stay here again. Oh, this is also really close (like walking... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,We arrived at night and get a room on the corner 2nd floor. The balcony door was not closed and my kids saw a big spider on the bed headboard. The hairdryer ( the electrical plug) was having problem and did not work. Room has plenty of space and service is great( they bring me a new hair dryer).
Gardena Terrace Inn,Really quiet great for relaxing and peaceful rest.
Gardena Terrace Inn,Room was clean and relatively new. Courtyard in middle of hotel was pleasant. Covered off street parking is nice. The breakfast was just packaged danish. They no longer have a full hot Japanese breakfast and I missed that. But I like the neighborhood and the resturants nearby.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"My first time in Gardena, what a lovely city nearby LAX. The hotel is a hidden gem, managed by a very kind family. Couzy, clean and safe, that's all you need after wandering around town. Also, the manager was kind enough to keep my luggage after check out, because I had to ran some errands. The only negative thing I... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"For once, the Tripadvisor reviews let me down. I had booked this motel for our bracket stay in LA. Three days before 5 days after our trip to Hawaii.

Gardena Terrace Inn,"Second time staying here, rooms are spacious and clean. Free parking is a plus and it's close to the highways which is convenient. Staff is very friendly and accommodating!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"GREAT PLACE, GREAT SERVICE. I've stayed at the Garden Terrace twice for business. Once in the Jacuzzi Suite (LOVELY) and once in a regular room and both experiences were great. I was expecting a lower class Hotel because its next door to a couple of Police car filled motels, but the owner and wife of this establisment made sure I... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I've stayed here several times and since the very first time, the staff here have treated me like gold. The staff has been very friendly and helpful every time I've stayed here. I was amazed by how nice and clean the rooms are. One thing I really enjoyed was the nice showers and comfortable beds. I also enjoyed watching the... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,I checked in staff was very friendly. Nice underground parking one way in one way out. In view of the front office. Very well lit. Property was very well kept no trash or graffiti anywhere. Room smelled clean nice big TV microwave and refrigerator. I felt very comfortable. It's not a high end hotel by any means but it's clean and comfortable. I will be back. My only complaints the breakfast and a night security person would be good just for peace of mind. The area is older and a few undesirables are walking the streets at night.
Gardena Terrace Inn,Good hotel for the price. Ok location. Close to long beach. Only bad thing was that the pillows were flat. Plenty of parking spots. Staff was very friendly.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"This is a hidden gem.I got hooked on this place about a year ago. It's clean,cozy and very affordable.This is my go to spot when I want to get away. The customer service is great. Pankaj and Jayshri really take care of you!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"The hotel staff were very courteous. The room was nice and clean, and very nicely decorated. We only stayed one night, but it was a pleasant stay."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Nice, clean, comfortable... The stuff is really kind. Room is large enough, bed was perfect, bathroom too.. Maybe the price is little bit higher then it should be, but it's ok.. Think i will come again!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"My first impression of Gardena Inn was experienced before I became a client. The interaction between guests and management during the lobby registration process was very warm and inviting. Guests would go out of their way to wave and smile at managers as they drove pass the office. During my initial registration, my first day staying at Gardena Inn was... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,It was horrible... The whole time I was there they never came in and cleaned up or changed the trash and then the took money from my account without my knowledge which ruined the rest of my trip. They did not do anything but void the transaction. They were not customer friendly at all.
Gardena Terrace Inn,The room was clean and comfortable. The staff took very good care of me. Adam() in particular went above and beyond to provide superior customer service. My choice to stay here was made based on location and price. In all ways I am extremely satisfied with my choice. I'll be back.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"My fianc and I had intentions of going on a two-day getaway while off from work so we decided to head to visit our neighbors to the south in and around Los Angeles. Our to-do list included an overnight excursion to Hollywood Horror Nights, breakfast in Redondo and an evening of Disneyland fun at Annaheim. We picked this hotel because... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,The room smell like cigarettes. I couldn't sleep because of the smell.
Gardena Terrace Inn,"clean room, nice staff, close to the beach. did I say it's close to the beach yes! manhattan, hermosa and the ever popular, redondo beach!"
Gardena Terrace Inn,I had a newly remodeled room which was good. Glad I brought my own soap bar. For the price it was good for me.
Gardena Terrace Inn,ok
Gardena Terrace Inn,It was peacefully and comfortable at night.. I would stay there again..
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I was really tired after leaving another hotel because it was not clean AT ALL. It was refreshing to see this hotel, beautiful."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"I booked a room at the Gardena Terrace Inn for 80 a night, looking for just a place to sleep after our late arrival in LA and our departure for Palm Springs the following morning. Given the low price point, I wasn't expecting much. We checked in late, and it took a little bit of time to find someone to... More"
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Overpriced hotel that had many different prices for various markets. Service was bad and whilst room was updated it was not finished and had many flaws. Breakfast was the worst I have had, very minimal."
Gardena Terrace Inn,"We enjoyed our stay and appreciate them for letting us use their printer behind the counter. We weren't looking for a 5 star place, just somewhere to stay for the night as we continued along our journey."
Gardena Terrace Inn,it was nice.
Gardena Terrace Inn,The Gardena Terrace inn is only a 15 min drive to the airport and is ideal if you want to stay nearby. The rooms and bathrooms are comfy and clean. We were visiting relatives late on a Friday night and did not arrive until 3am. We had to ring the bell but someone was there to check us in. Free... More
Gardena Terrace Inn,"Bad things: Older building but rooms are quite cleaned and repainted. No breakfast, No view, only one window next to door, so you need to keep blinds close to have privacy. Folks are smoking outside in the common area. Some neighbors are also loud. Queen bed is very bouncy... Good things: Good location, close to highway. CVS pharmacy block away. Looks like safe neighborhood. Friendly receptionist."
Gardena Terrace Inn,Ali and Kathyrn made my stay comfortable and welcoming. Both staff took time to help me and listen to my every need. I loved the area for it was very convenient to all my needs as well. The housekeeping did an amazing job with my room with keeping it clean during my stay Oct 1st-5th . I will be back and recommend this hotel 100

Gardena Terrace Inn,Soiled curtains. Smelly pillows. No water pressure. Bugs in room.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"I attend the local dog shows twice per year in this area. I stay at this La Quinta each time I need to spend the night for the dog show. It is conveniently located by I-65 and I enjoy the free breakfast allowing me extra time to get ready so I don't have to rush off and find breakfast somewhere. I also love the indoor pool so I can swim even in nasty weather, and adore having the hot tub to relax after a long day running in the ring with my dogs."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Just a quick overnight restful stay for our family. Was nice and quiet but very comfortable.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This was the second time I've stayed at this hotel. A few pros and cons - make a reservation or you'll be paying high prices. Also, there was too much chlorine in the pool when we were there (our eyes were burning). We had to leave the pool area early. The breakfast is good, the beds are comfortable, and the... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,The pillows were lumpy. The room was a little tired.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Nasty disgusting room. Carpet dirty. Bathtub with soap scum and hair. Several electrical outlets not working. My daughter screamed through the night b/c there was something sharp sticking her through the pillow. Room smelt of mildew. Was moist and muggy. Manager of hotel notified and I was told he couldn't do anything about it b/c I booked through a 3rd party -Hotel.com. Didn't even recieve an apology. Horrible stay. Never again
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,When I booked the room I booked a room with 2 Queen beds. When I arrived I was given a room with 2 double beds. the beds were too small and uncomfortable. nothing else was available.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Not sure what the other rooms were like, but I had a smoking room and it was not good. Last minute stop and only room I could get in the area. Very strong smoke smell. Bathroom smelled of urine. Bed linens were clean. Would not recommend smoking room. Breakfast was decent. Would not stay there again. Sorry, maybe the other rooms are better, but smoking room was not."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Room was smaller and a little more dated than other Laquintas we have stayed in, but was clean. The bed was very comfortable more so than larger rooms we have stayed in. Staff was friendly. Breakfast was standard. Location was easy off the freeway and they were pet friendly."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"All good, but lacking expected toiletries in bathroom (no shampoo)."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We stayed here one night on our way down to the Gulf Coast. Property is certainly aged but beds were really comfortable. It was also fairly quiet considering the place was full AND we had a 1st floor room near the pool. Room not the cleanest and furniture was aged, with very few outlets. Reception at check-in was nice and... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Hotel is close to our venue. The only problems we had were that none of the wake up calls we set went off, luckily I had backup alarms. I didn't mention it to management because I never checked to be sure it wasn't a problem with our phone and not at their end. We would have liked to have had more hot food at breakfast but otherwise we had a wonderful stay and would stay there again."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"the rooms are small , the beds are only full size, tv channels were poor the breakfast is like a Continental except you can make a waffle.

March 2016, we set out on our spring break vacation and drove for... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Had an unfortunate mixup on billing which took 2 days to get cleared up.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Came to town to see JoshuaDtv in Nashville. Stayed in Franklin because it was close to family and this hotel was one of only a few with an indoor pool. We had a great weekend at a clean hotel with exceptional customer service.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Front desk person was very friendly and helpful. Answered all questions politely and went out the way to make facilities available. The room was normal size and clean. The pool was heated. (not a spa type of heat but not ice cold either) The pool area is nice and the pool was clean with no overly bleach smell. The breakfast was typical of the hotel standard. Hotel is in a good area, It is beside a Cracker Barrel and there is shopping centers nearby. No problems with this stay."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The hotel was clean and nice. It just seemed to be a little understaffed. The indoor pool had no towels. And when promised by the front desk to bring some, they never came. I had to walk back to my room soaking wet. That could cause an accident as well as odors because the carpets will be wet by customers."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my fiance and I. It was during finals week, and since I also work for housing on campus, it's the busiest time of the year with everyone moving out. I really needed to just get away for a night to keep my sanity. Upon checking in, the staff was fairly nice. However the next morning, I felt as though we were being judged for being young. Both of us are 21, and it felt as though the staff were annoyed with us from the moment we walked downstairs for breakfast."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Stay was what it was intended. Just to sleep in. Breakfast was ok.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,king size bed... comfy. we had to kill about 6 lady bugs and one fly though. then everything was fine.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The room was worth the price paid. But, the air conditioner had to be set at 64 before it cooled correctly and the toilet would at time hang up and not stop running. Overall, the room was fine."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Front staff at check in very nice. Had stayed in this same hotel before but this particular room had gum on carpet and gap in the door that you could see out in the hall. Biggest problem was that it took about 4 hours for the air conditioner to cool the room. Room was so humid and musty smelling. Second the place is pet friendly and is not advertised as such and if I would have known would have stayed elsewhere due to my child's allergies.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Just what you expect from a La Quinta. My husband had a business trip so the kids, the dogs, and tagged along. We always know we can expect a clean, dog-friendly room a reasonable price."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Not worth the money. Staff was nice and friendly, but the room was old and dirty."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"I have stayed at this location many times over the last six years and have always had a four star experience. The staff is very professional and always go the extra mile in providing friendly and accommodating service. Clean rooms, coffee 24 hours a day, great location."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"very good for the price,great location, staff was very nice."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This hotel was a former Baymont Inn that has not been renovated. The property was not clean and our room included a leaking air conditioner, which soaked a pair of shorts and the bottom of my suitcase."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,My children were awaken at 2 am because they were being bitten by bed bugs. We saw and killed 2 actual bugs!!!
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,We stopped here on our way thru to Memphis and were very happy to pick this hotel. The bed was super comfortable and the indoor pool and hot tub were great. The Cracker Barrel next door is good.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Not bad for one night stay. Bed to small for two adults. Need some upgrades.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We stayed one night on our way home from down south to up north. We have 2 big dogs and 2 cats that travel with us. LQ is always great about the pets - they accommodated my advance request for a 1st floor room. Now for the hotel itself - this is an older LQ, but I think it has... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We booked a standard King, non-smoking room. When we got there, they gave us a smoking room that smelled and looked horrible. When I asked if we could move to a non-smoking room, like we had booked, they said that the room was a non-smoking room (then why was there an ashtray on the sink) and that someone must have broken the rules and smoked in the room previously. They said they were completely booked and could not move us. We had to keep the window open during our entire stay (low of 25 degrees one night) just so we could breathe. There were stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in that room for a long time. There were also body hairs in the shower when we got there. Not just one or two, but multiple hairs all over the tub. When we went down for breakfast Sunday morning at 7am, both trash cans were completely full and people had begun leaving their trash on the tables. We never saw an employee while we were down there. I have stayed with LaQuinta multiple times before and have never had an issue. I will definitely never stay at this location again after this terrible experience."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We often choose LaQuinta because of consistency. This motel was on the lower end of the LaQuinta scale. Room was not bad, but less clean than expected, maybe just showing wear. Breakfast service had no juice (we are not coffee drinkers). Machine was broken and no alternate was provided."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Room 329 the first room they put us in had bad water damage on the ceiling smelled so bad it took our breath away upon entering the room. All of their king bed rooms are on the noisy highway side. They dont tell u that unless u ask. Fridge was noisy in our 2nd room carpet had dirt all over it. There is no way it was vaccuumed. Hot tub in pool area was broken ice cold. Walking down the hall heard dogs barking people having relations. Otherwise......it was fine!
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Beds were awesome!! To warm in the pool/hottub area. Dogs were barking all hours of the day/night.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,it was great
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Smelly room and dirty bed
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We were driving back to Dayton, Oh from Pensacola, FL and were very tired. I got onto Expedia and the site found us a hotel near where we were presently at. Although the room was on the 4th floor, the hotel did have an elevator. It was also close to an outside door where my husband and I could go and smoke. The in-door pool was the icing on the cake. I had my grandson and great nephew with me so we all really enjoyed unwinding in the pool before beds. Beds were comfortable too."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,This hotel isn't a bad option for a quick overnight stay but it's a bit dingy.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,The hotels in this area at the time of my stay were very pricey so I picked this one based on cost and the reviews were not bad. I was very happy with the stay. Room was clean and modern. Everyone was friendly and helpful. No complaints at all and would stay again.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Good staff. Okay breakfast. Room had large stain on floor, but was clean. The front desk staff was very helpful. Hard to fine, even with navigation (could see from interstate, but could not fine way to hotel. Had Cracker Barrel right next door--very convenient."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Stayed 3 nights, location was good, neighborhood good. The motel was OK, but everything seemed to be a little bit below what we have come to expect from La Quinta. It wasn't that bad , but it wasn't that good either."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Very accommodating and friendly staff. Rooms were very clean and met our pet friendly needs. Location was close to Nashville as well as Interstate access. Making a reservation was very easy over the phone as we were on the road traveling. Would stay here again.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Disappointing, but it was on the cheap side, so I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. Rooms were pretty dirty and things seemed outdated. We used the pool and the staff gave my wife a hard time asking for 5 pool towels. If we were rude people, we would have told them off, but we are sometimes overly considerate. This is our chance to tell everyone what we think now. They allow pets here and so things just seemed on the dirty side. Hotel staff, as I indicated, were borderline rude. They were busy when we got there, but no reason to roll your eyes at us. Seriously I wonder what happened to Southern Hospitality and the customer is always right It's not like we asked for anything out of the ordinary. Consequently, we stayed at the Best Western (Downtown Nashville) on our way back through town: Much cleaner. Much nicer. Updated. Very comfortable beds. Excellent (Continental) breakfast. Friendly staff. We will be staying there next time for sure. A little more, but worth it."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Front desk person was very friendly and helpful. Answered all questions politely and went out the way to make facilities available. The room was normal size and clean. The pool was heated. (not a spa type of heat but not ice cold either) The pool area is nice and the pool was clean with no overly bleach smell. The breakfast was typical of the hotel standard. Hotel is in a good area, It is beside a Cracker Barrel and there is shopping centers nearby. No problems with this stay."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,We were in town for the hockey All Star games. The hotel is just a few miles South of Nashville The rooms are clean the staff was great. The pool was clean and a lot of fun for the kids and the hot tub was nice too! We will stay again.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The room was not as clean as I would have liked. It seemed like they only cleaned the areas they could reach with a vacuum. They didn't bother to move any furniture or use any tools to get the crevices. That being said my husband and I felt safe and our 45 lb dog got to stay for free. Check in and check out were a breeze. Breakfast was decent. Pool was not clean, but hot tub was excellent. Elevator seemed a bit old and used but it got us to our room. Not the caliber of hotel I am used to, but hey my fur baby got to stay for free which was really nice. I will definitely use a LaQuinta again when traveling with her. But I would not stay there if I was flying solo."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"It was worth the price, it was clean, I felt safe and the staff was very friendly. It was simply an older hotel, nothing fancy, felt dated."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Excellent location even though it was Sunday we were given great ideas about things to do.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Our stay was because of a funeral of a dear friend and the La Quinta was convenient and easy access to all we needed to do. The staff was good, the room was clean and met our needs. The price was fair especially for last minute reservations on our part. I would recommend the La Quinta to my friends."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Traveling on Independence Day means I expect the roads and hotels to be like zoos. That said, the fire alarm went off due to a firecracker set off by someone on the upper floors and we all had to evacuate. All of that is procedural and that's fine, but the front desk personnel never left the desk and then when we politely asked if we could go back inside we were met with an employee who was neither willing to explain what was going on nor nice about addressing us. She stood in front of the doors like a guard dog, talking to us like we were all unruly children (though no one was crowding the door, not following protocol, or otherwise giving the staff reason to be that stern). It was very clear that there was no emergency. The hotel was understaffed, which is why I think the staff morale seemed low--it was a holiday weekend, so I wonder about their willingness to be there. I had to literally search for an employee when it was time to check out the front desk personnel was actually in the back washing dishes from breakfast at check-out time. The only thing I really care about in a hotel breakfast is coffee, and they didn't even have real coffee. It was a NesCafe machine, and it wasn't working properly when I was there--very disappointing. Overall, it was a decent stay. My main issue was with staff, but they were dealing with a lot on the holiday weekend and I don't think there was enough staff there. I typically think more highly of La Quinta Inns, but this was just OK."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Hotel was busy so staff did a good job considering. At night parking lot was full, the night hotel person offered Her space (nice) but we finally found someone leaving. I will say a lot of construction people stayed here, unfortunately they left mud on elevators and Stairs. Also, I know it is dog friendly, I don't have a pet and would prefer a room that never had pets in it. Think old days of Smoking and Non smoking rooms.Comments/suggestions"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,wonderful!
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Not bad, but nothing special. The front desk was helpful, elevator was extremely slow. Breakfast was ok, standard hotel fare."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,1 night stay on way home from vacation. Hotel is loud. Ice maker only on 2 of the 4 floors. Breakfast area way too small for size of hotel. Made getting something to eat extremely difficult.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Good overall
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,My husband wanted an indoor pool.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Clean, Comfortable and quiet rooms. Friendly staff. Disappointed that the stay was not eligible for the LQ rewards program. Televison channel in breakfast roomis on the channel of the staff which was not a local station. Guests miss local weather and road conditions reports."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,King size bed... comfy. We had to kill about 6 lady bugs and one fly though. Then everything was fine.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Overwhelming pet smells. I developed a rash within 2 minutes of walking in the room, but hotel would not refund money so we could stay somewhere else"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,This dog friendly hotel is clean. The beds were comfortable. The staff was nice. Breakfast was good. It is located in a nice area with a lot of history. They had a pool but I did not go swimming. The only complaint I have is that dogs pee in the elevator so there was always a wet floor when I... More
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Here on business for three days. Overall good stay. Room was clean, and comfortable. Convenient to many restaurants and the interstate."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Staff real nice and helpful. Checked into room around 8 pm, door to room was open, wedged open with bolt lock, thought that was strange. Huge puddle of water still in the tub, not inviting."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,This is our third time staying in this hotel. It has clean rooms. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Convenient location to restaurants and shopping. Many restaurants to chose from for hotel delivery. Quiet. Free WiFi. Small but decent fitness center. Will stay there again. Like that they don't charge extra for pets.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,There was not a good selection for breakfast the ice machine on the third floor did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Staff was very welcoming. Room appeared clean but bathroom smelled like urine. Air conditioning was not working properly - showed 63 degrees but was more like 72. Was too tired and busy to ask for and change to another room but would probably not book another room here.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We arrived with our elderly, well behaved golden retriever, were given a quiet King room as requested, clean and fresh on arrival, and although it was near the interstate, the noise was minimal. In the morning, a fine display of cereals, yogurt, breads and beverages were available, and we were permitted to have our quiet dog nearby, following the health... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Poor sanitation cleaning room, pet smell and noise. You can do far better elsewhere. I have stayed there so many times, some good, some bad and I am just over it. The place could be so nice but unfortunately it caters to pets and construction type workers. Not my cup of tea. You can do better elsewhere both quality and... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,booked this hotel because it has an indoor pool and hot tub. service was okay
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Carpets were filthy and badly stained. Entrance had slippery substance in front of door that I and others slipped on. Hairs in bath tub and other particles on floor. Elevator walls needed scrubbing.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,I was in the area to visit the Franklin Battlefield. The hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there. It was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was just ok. The bad part was that either the washer or dryer started to smoke at 11:30 at night when I was there and the fire alarm went... More
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"allows pets, noisy, small room felt cramped but very friendly helpful staff"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,We were disappointed with our latest stay at this LaQuinta. Our room was not vacuumed ....we found the previous guest slippers near the bed. There was black mold in the bathroom in the shower and the floor was dirty. The elevator was dirty and extremely SLOW. There was only one elevator.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The night manager was very nice, but the unpleasantness set in quickly. The room was noisy, both from the highway and being able to hear neighbors and people in the hallway. It was difficult to sleep because I could hear everything. The ceiling was stained, and some of the fixtures looked worn. It needs an update badly. Some of the... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This place is nice and clean and so are the rooms. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our rooms were comfortable after our original reservation was messed up. The breakfast was acceptable and the pool was clean. The hot tub could have used a few more chemicals to keep it cleaner. Overall, a very pleasant experience for... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"very nice stay. a bit of a problem at check in, but resolved without too much fuss. Didn't get was I had reserved but didn't have to go elsewhere for a room. It would appear that some training might be in order so misinformation is not shared."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Pool & hot tub nice
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,This location is old and outdated. Noise was terrible and room had a musty odor. We were woke up many times during the night of the noise coming from the lobby area.Rooms need to be updated and carpets replaced.The manager did deduct 25 but we will never stay at this location again.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Overall I was extremely pleased with the quality of the room and amenities. Staff was courteous and helpful. I would stay here again without hesitation. I can't comment on the food/kitchen area because there is a Cracker Barrel next door and I had no need to eat breakfast at the hotel.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"I tried to find a hotel in Murfreesboro starting 1.5 weeks ago and this was the best and closest choice I had. Every hotel was booked!! The front desk person when I checked in was lovely! I was third in line and when it was my turn, two additional people came from the back. They could have checked on her... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,My stay was great and the hotel was in a goodlocation. it wasn't far from any place I went to
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Nice hotel to stop mid point between Chicago and Florida. Just what you need to give the kids and yourself a break - indoor swimming pool, wifi, nice cable tv options and free breakfast! Great value for the rate."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This was the only hotel with availability near Nasville due to an NRA convention that brought 70000 people to town. The town of Franklin was charming, but this was just an average budget hotel. There was a strong smell of chlorine in the Lobby even though the pool area was at the other end of the hotel. The over-all impression was not so much dirty as worn, could use some updating. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but I would only stay here again if nothing else was available because it was not conveinent to downtown Nashville."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,My family and I stopped here on our way back from Florida. Unfortunately this was the only property in the area that had vacancy and I can now see why it was not full. The room was disgusting! The smell in 220 was so pungent that if I hadn't just driven through a tornado and gotten stuck on the interstate... More

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The breakfast area was dirty and sticky. Rooms were dirty, hair in tub, trash left in trash can. White sheets had yellow stains and very dusty. I will never go back."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,The hotel was obviously upgraded from a lower ratered hotel. You could hear people in the hallways at night very clearly. But the staff was very good and breakfast very good. The hotel was conveniently at a good rate.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,The room smelled like a strong perfume to cover up dog odorhad to move to another room and it wasn't much better never stay in at aLAQUINTA again people need to leave their dogs at home or not stay in a hotel was very dissatisfied they should've paid me to stay there
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,We had a great one night stay. We found it very easy to get into downtown Franklin and to the Mall.

The indoor pool and hot tub were great! No complaints whatsoever"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,pool & hot tub nice
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Not bad for an overnight. Clean, accommodating and being upgraded although we did not get a new room. Ask for a room with mini-fridge and microwave. We were tired and did not get one. Cracker Barrel next door, and easy to call and get pick up if you have a pet."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Front desk reception was friendly and courteous, but the room was not at all clean, the air conditioner did not work properly and the door to our room had a crack large enough to see through. Very disappointed!"

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This property is in need of an update. It is in a great location and we have stayed here multiple times.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,pretty sure we found poop stains on our comforter. hot tub was luke warm at best.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Great location for getting on/off I65 for travel thru Nadhville. It's south of all the traffic stuff, so it's also quite. We stayed here on a trip to Panama City, FL. Nice friendly staff. Allowed me to park my boat in safe place as always, my dog was welcome."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Simple easy check-in. Like this location for one night stays, where I just want to sleep and freshen up. Room was clean, fresh, AC had a thermostat. And price/value is excellent. Franklin has excellent places to eat and out of the traffic of Nashville."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,This was my third stay at this hotel in 3 years. My experience with the staff has always been very good. However ownership and management attention to this hotel is either indifferent or incompetent. As in previous stays I have never seen the general manager at any time during my stays. Even when serious problems occurred during the first two... More
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Arrived to find the room clean, odor free, cool. To add to that Tv was great, water pressure great. Pool and hot tub ckean and very enjoyable. Indoor sauna like atmosphere. There was free wifi and plenty of room for pups to be comfortable. Definietly worth the price. Will be back again."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We always stay at La Quinta because they are pet friendly. The staff is kind to our dog, and we all feel welcome. The room was clean, and we had everything we needed for comfort. We love this location. We used to live in the Nashville area, so it is close to everything and everyone we wanted to visit. Also,...

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"this hotel is dated, needs a good cleaning overhaul. the breakfast provided did not meet the standards of most other Le Quinta hotels and the dinning staff was unfriendly. however the location to a major interstate highway is excellent."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Room was dirty and worn. Bathroom had mold around tub faucet and in corners. Carpet wasn't vacuumed while we were there (2 nights) same thing was on the floor after the beds were made. Drapes can't be closed to block out light. Hall carpets were spotted and dirty Breakfast selection was good.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Smallish room, no fridge."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,We did not arrive until 1:30 am and they allowed a late check out at 12:30 which was deeply appreciated! Clean and very dog friendly...quiet until about 8am when people began checking out and letting doors slam...but housekeeping observed our do not disturb sign and the beds were very comfortable and easy wi-fi.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Nice clean safe place to stay. Pet friendly. Cracker Barrel next door. Shopping and restaurants within 5 miles. Been staying at this place every March for 3 years. Nice hotel with nice staff indoor pool if you are traveling with children.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"I stayed here on my way home from Florida. It was my first stay, and I was very impressed with this smoke-free LaQuinta Inn. It will be a place I will definitely return to. The room was reasonably priced, spotlessly clean, smelled fresh, and the bed was comfy. It is not easy to find a clean hotel that allows pets,...

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"It probably isn't fair to compare the hotel with the one I stayed in the night before which was huge and had a suite...but in all fairness, the LaQuinta was actually a little cleaner than the big one.

La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"This hotel is very clean and quiet, even when it is completely full for a dog show (yes, many dogs there this trip). We stay at this hotel nearly once a month. The Breakfast Buffet could be as good as some other LaQuintas, but, it is not bad."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"A quick overnight in a roadside hotel. Not the newest LaQuinta I've ever stayed in, but it is well maintained and the bed was comfortable and not worn out. The room (a King bed) was spacious and the window opened - I often find it pleasant to have a little fresh air in my hotel room, so really appreciate when the windows aren't sealed up. There were definite signs of wear - walking patterns in carpets, chinks in the paint, etc. The carpets were clean though, and the chinks were visible through new paint - not untended at all. The only thing I didn't like about the room is the bathroom layout - the room door entered into the sink area, and the toilet/shower were across the entry hall of the room. Awkward . . ."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Stayed one night. Room was very clean. Easy off and on interstate. Minimal breakfast, but fine for our needs. Cracker Barrel next door. Staff friendly. Dog show in town. Lots of gorgeous animals to see. Very pet friendly."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"We often stay at LaQuinta Hotels, but this was not one of the better ones. It is too close to the interstate and we had traffic noise all night. The breakfast choices were sparse and there was no one around enjoying the trash and cleaning up. The stopper in our sink was broken. We were quite disappointed in our stay... More"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"The hotel smells of smoke so incredibly bad. It's a non smoking hotel, yet it just stunk. The hotel overall was tired, the rooms were in better shape than the rest of the hotel, clean rooms, bed comfy. We needed a place to sleep while on a road trip and didn't want to spend a lot since we knew we would be there less than 10 hours, don't know that I would stop here again though."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Pretty sure we found poop stains on our comforter. Hot tub was luke warm at best.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,Building is dated but clean. Beds are comfy and the free breakfast options were great and much appreciated!!! They even had a washer and dryer for an emergency load of laundry.
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Just wanted to see Nashville, but not be right in town, so this location was great. Also checked out Franklin nightlife, awesome! Front desk clerk gave us a card for a local person to pick us up and bring us back from a night in Nashville! Would stay here again!"
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Stayed for one night with our pet. Pets stay free, which is really nice. Room was clean and hotel was quiet. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Nothing fancy, but for our needs as an overnight stop on our long trek to Florida, it was perfect. Even had an indoor pool. Great value."
La Quinta Inn and Suites Nashville Franklin,"Made last minute reservation. Had a reservation at another hotel, but after reading the reviews I canceled. Sure am glad I did. Check in went smooth.
